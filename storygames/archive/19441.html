I will implement the AW thinking and, while I haven't played the game yet, it should take around 1-1,5 hours to play. I know that the preparation takes around 10 minutes, and you can explain the rules while playing so that wont take any time. The questioning should land around 1-2 minutes and there will be at least ten of those so that's 10-20 minutes. By experience, all projects takes around three times longer than expected, and that's how I came up with the estimation.<br/><br/>I got a comment about the ending being anti-climatic, and I can sort of agree. I don't know if there will be any sense of fulfillment by playing this game. I'm actually hoping that discussing the game could create that. I do think I could put a little more emphasis on making the participants realize what they have created from nothing. I do wonder however, if this is even a game that people can consider returning to. I could make this game more competitive - and it were at the beginning - but I want to explore other ways of playing. I will see how things turn out if I get to playtest this next weekend.<br/><br/>The game got a lot of hidden improv principles, and I'm even surprised myself of how many there are on such a few pages.\n<blockquote>It's a big network of <i>Yes Ands</i> and <i>Yes Buts</i>.  </blockquote>\nActually, it's only "Yes, and" in the improv way that you can <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/423861#Comment_423861" rel="nofollow">read about here</a>. I will change the "but" to "and"  in the 1-3 result in a try to step even further away from the RPG thoughts about how to handle "Yes and(/but)".\n<blockquote>* When we're doing the suspect interrogating, it says that if it continues another player should pick up the hat and ask questions. Is there a structure to that (eg going around the table, person that was just questioned is now detective, etc) or is it just a "who wants to ask questions next?" situation?</blockquote>\nMy thinking here is using a kind of social self-regulation but it's also a new way of looking at initiative systems. My brother is a theater director and an old roleplaying gamer, and he brought up the idea that the one who got the ideas should be the one who takes the initiative. Roleplaying games - especially in combat - tend to break this thinking by ordering in the participants into segments, and that hinders the natural flow that can occur in a conversation.<br/><br/>I do think that if there are two people that constantly taking the hat, they will involve the others by making them into suspects. I don't think there is "better" in any way to play the detective, and the suspects can contribute as well in creating facts. So I don't think it's necessary to create any kind of initiative system, but instead taking advantage of the social rules withing the group.<br/><br/>I will however change the text to something like "Another participant may then volunteer to take the hat and redo the whole motive section". (Added "volunteer to".)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlbeyAmakiir" title="AlbeyAmakiir"><img alt="AlbeyAmakiir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/139/nCE1BSIBJZEBM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlbeyAmakiir">AlbeyAmakiir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432848/#Comment_432848" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-19T22:22:31+00:00" title="May 19, 2014 10:22PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In terms of climax, I know that in these kinds of stories, they tend to seem to accuse about half or a bit more of the people in the room, before making the final real accusation.

I can imagine situations where it's really hard to come up with the fifth motive. I will try to arrange a playtest this weekend and see how it goes and take in advice from the players.\n<blockquote>Partially, the climax is surprise, and partially it's the final explanation that comes after.</blockquote>\nIf I use my own theory of engagement, then a game should have a combination of investment, decision, uncertainty and effort in various degrees.<br/><br/>Investment comes from creating the suspects and the objects and happenings around them.<br/><br/>Hard decisions aren't there at all. The game got a lot of smaller decisions: to take the hat, what questions to ask, how to respond to the questions, deciding who got the best motive and which player that got the best suggestion.<br/><br/>I don't think there is any big effort here. Smaller effort comes in making stuff up on the spot. Effort is however mostly about participation and I think the game helps out with that in a pretty nice way, both in creating the suspects and who plays which role. The discussion at the end brings a little participation too.<br/><br/>Uncertainty consist in what the other players bring (social contingency). At the end, I agree that there is lack of uncertainty. I could just let the die roll and let that one be the one who murdered Mr Crow but that would be a cheap solution.\n<blockquote>Is there a way you can make the last explanation the canon one? </blockquote>\nI see what you did there. That's how it's usually played out in these stories, and it got me thinking. How about this?\n<blockquote><b>Revelation</b> - tying things up<br/>When all suspects got at least two facts and a motive, it's time for revelation. Put the hat upside down on the table. Each participant writes it's own name and a suspect that they want to be the murderer. Put the note in the hat, and the last one person putting a note in the hat shakes the hat draws a name, call that person out and who that person suspect.<br/><br/>That participant gives a description of why and how the suspect could have murdered Mr Crow. New information may be added during this explanation.<br/><br/>Continue with drawing names and give more explanations of how it could have happened, taking the previous information into account, up until there are only two notes left. The next drawn note is going to reveal the murderer. That participant may do the whole explanation by itself or demand assistance from the others. If the same suspect appears more than once during the draw, feel free to involve other suspects in the plan.<br/><br/>&lt;- The game is over. Discuss what went well, and what needs to be improved until the next time.-&gt;</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432885/#Comment_432885" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-21T08:58:20+00:00" title="May 21, 2014  8:58AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that better, Rickard.<br/><br/>And effectively voting for the potential murderer is not bad. However, you may lose the "surprise" factor which you usually get in these stories: ultimately, you want one or more people to be heavily accused, but then someone who has NOT previously been suspected to be revealed as the murderer.<br/><br/>How to do this? It's not entirely obvious.<br/><br/>I had a game where a similar mechanic was implemented thus (reframed for a detective scenario for the sake of this thread):<br/><br/>* When you make an accusation against someone, deal them one card from the deck, face down.<br/>* Everyone takes turns doing the same, until everyone has been accused.<br/>* Each player turns over their hand of cards and discards all but the lowest card.<br/>* The player with the highest card remaining is the real murderer.<br/><br/>What this does is it makes the person who was accused only once much more likely to "win" the contest than someone who was accused repeatedly, and less transparently so than it would be with, say, a pool of dice that you roll. <br/><br/>It's not quite right for your game, but you may wish to give this aspect  - the endgame - some serious thought, since that's where the payoff of the detective crime novel reaches its climax.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432900/#Comment_432900" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-21T15:00:10+00:00" title="May 21, 2014  3:00PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems clear to me, but I don't know what the suspect is supposed to do when they roll a 6?<br/>Other than that, it is a cool muerder mystery RPG.<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432905/#Comment_432905" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-21T18:42:22+00:00" title="May 21, 2014  6:42PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2014 10:25PM by Rickard.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a layout fault in the new version.

Not playing it out, <i>creating</i> it, like how I would create a murder mystery to <b>Call of Cthulhu</b> or similar games. I'm pretty sure that this is a unique take, even though I played <b>A Taste for Murder</b>. It's a unique take because it strikes a totally different WHY. It's not about playing out a character or trying to frame someone else\u2014it's about seeing how something you feed with ideas is growing. It's Easy Fun, if I use one of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMsrVanw2Ss" rel="nofollow">Nicole Lazzarro's terms</a>, in comparison with Hard Fun or Serious Fun. The game also has a smaller People Fun. It's a light-hearted leisure game.<br/><br/>MAKING PEOPLE WANT TO CONTRIBUTE<br/>I tried to make the light-heartiness stronger by a playful layout with pictures and, despite the theme, choosing names like Mr Rat and Mrs Cow. I did these decisions to make people more comfortable in participate, where Hard Fun (competition) or Serious Fun (do it for a higher purpose) comes with obligations to contribute <i>well</i>. I wanted the game to focus on the group. On a sensation of creation. Of an insight of where things are going. An exploration of where things are going. This is why I added that the group should discuss what they have accomplished, to get a sensation of what they have created together from nothing.<br/><br/>During play, I wanted people to bring own ideas based on what other people said. I want people to help each other out to make the game easier for everyone. One thing I did was to make a rule physical. At first, I said in the rules that people could ask for assistance on several places, but I then turned that into a role. By saying "Assistant, please" anyone could take that role and give two suggestions where the detective chooses one of them. This wasn't used much in the beginning but later on, possibly because I asked for the assistant a few times to show how it was done, it felt like people needed it. It's great, if the player gets a blockage, to always have the assistant to fall back to.<br/><br/>Another thing that contributes into bringing comfort is, according to my own theories, the fact that the game has a hard structure. A structure that is clear and showed up into everybody's faces in how the game should be played. You have to ask questions, you have to put on a hat (a gimmick that enforces the light-heartiness), you have to ask two questions, each suspect must have a motive at the end, and the suspect must agree with everything. We had a beginner in our group and she said that she was terrible at making things up. I noticed this in the beginning of the session but hardly at all after half the game.<br/><br/>DEVELOPING THROUGH NARROWNESS<br/>And here's another thing I've been thinking about these last five years: to make things strict and small so people want to break free from it. Some of the comments I've been receiving on two fora have suggested other themes, and I wonder if I really have it in the game. Obviously, by using a narrow theme, I made people think of how to change the game. At the end of the game, I write that people should discuss what can be changed upon the next time they are playing it, and here is where I leave a space for someone to suggest another theme. I'm actually thinking of removing the paragraph that says that you can come up with names of your own, just to enforce this behavior even more.<br/><br/>There are other tight structures that can be broken too. The questions were followed in the beginning but towards the end, people started to play out conversations in form of questions. This is something I guessed could happen because when you got a clear structure, it's comfortable to break free from it. If it doesn't work, you can always fall back on the original structure. I think this is really interesting in roleplaying game design and I wonder if it has been explored at all before.<br/><br/>My thought with discussing what could be changed is to make every group develop the game in their own way. This would make the game stay alive.<br/><br/>LEADERS SHOULD LEAD, NOT WAIT<br/>Another thing that this game plays around with is a different take on initiative. It did just what I thought it would do. The ones playing the detective picked the participants, who had sat there the longest doing nothing, to play the suspect. We had an equal share of playing the detective, without the game telling us to do it. I wanted to use the existing social rules, and it's possible that it did just work because we were strangers playing. But does it matter? This is a new kind of initiative system where the active players takes the initiative but where the inactive players get to play the suspects. I discovered, and that's also what I had in mind, that the suspect and the detective had almost equal share in how they contributed to the facts. So it doesn't matter if one takes the initiative. To take the lead is a good thing and should be encouraged, instead of having that person sit and wait through a segmented turn taking rule.<br/><br/>WHAT WENT WRONG<br/>When I create mysteries, I use a relationship map like in my <a href="http://www.gnomestew.com/gming-advice/the-fish-tank-as-a-mystery-2/" rel="nofollow">fish tank article</a>. This didn't work at all with five players. The relationship map was hard to grasp after a while, with all the lines going everywhere. So I will instead write the names in columns and have one player writing facts - possibly the last one who played detective - while the others question each other.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>That's pretty much it. The game took about 1,5 hours and the beginner thought the game was one of the funniest games she ever played. And who was the murderer? Mr Rat, who had been conducting alien experiments together with Ms Unicorn. The late Mr Crow found them out. Mr Rat had also sexual relation with Mrs Cow, wife to Mr Crow, and were started to get feelings for her. So he thought he could hit two birds with one stone by killing Mr Crow. It was fun to reveal the motives one by one and finally hearing who the murderer was. The including of other suspects also worked great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433497/#Comment_433497" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-06T04:59:02+00:00" title="June  6, 2014  4:59AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2014 5:01AM by Rickard.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I realized that I missed one rather big design thought.<br/><br/>CREATE ACTIVE LISTENING<br/>What I think is one of the hottest things the last years in roleplaying game design, is the creation of active listening. When people that aren't in a scene wants to listen to what is said. A lot of games, like <b>Zombie Cinema</b> and <b>Dogs in the Vineyard</b>, achieves this by letting people that aren't in the scene affecting the outcome, by giving the ones in the scene rewards. If you read any of my thoughts on this forum, you know what I think of tangible rewards. So when I thought about how only two players were in each scene in The Murder of Mr Crow, I wanted to create active listening but without the use of rewards. "Assistant, please" is one of my ways of creating active listening. If people know that they can be included in the scene, they will probably listen to what has been said. Also, because everybody are going to find out a motive and because what has been established has to be taken into account, everybody must listen to what's going on. That the whole motive section is rather short (1-3 minutes of play) can also contribute to the active listening, where a 10-30 minute scene would instead loose interest after a while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433719/#Comment_433719" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-11T14:01:20+00:00" title="June 11, 2014  2:01PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2014 2:05PM by Rickard.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ASSIST INSTEAD OF HELP<br/>I'm a kind guy who often offer a lending hand to someone else, but I noticed that if I ask "May I help you?", people are less bound to want it, compared to if I ask "May I assist you?". That's the reason behind why "The Assistant" got it's name. If you want help, it's because you can't manage it on yourself, and I don't want that kind of feeling in a collaborative game. If someone however assist you, that person places itself lower than you. So this role is a way of playing with status within the group, but also making the group more accepting to asking for help.<br/><br/>YES CREATES ADVENTURE<br/>I'm currently rereading Impro by Keith Johnstone, and even if half my playtesters said that they wanted an option to say "no", I didn't change my game. I will now translate from the Swedish translation of Impro, page 153:\n<blockquote>There are humans that prefer saying "Yes", and there are humans that prefer saying "No". Those who says "Yes" gets rewarded through the adventures they will experience while those who says "No" gets rewarded by the security and safeness that they will achieve.<br/><br/>[Ideas that he got from Arthur Couch and Kenneth Kenison, from "Yessayers and Naysayers", Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychologyol 160, No 2, 1960. My remark]<br/><br/>/.../<br/><br/>There is a connection to status transactions here, because low-status players have a tendency to accept while high-status players block. The high-status player blocks every transaction, if they don't feel that they can control it.</blockquote>\nSo why did some of the playtesters want to say "no", and why did I refuse them? (As a side note, why am I tired of the default state in roleplaying games is failure [=to be told "no"]?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433788/#Comment_433788" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-13T14:43:38+00:00" title="June 13, 2014  2:43PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2014 10:08AM by Rickard.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            CONFLICT IS UNCERTAINTY<br/>It's accepted that conflict, in our Western society, is what drives a story. You can see the result of that thinking that in all kinds of roleplaying games\u2014especially Forge games. The Chinese and Japanese has a non-conflict narrative form called kish\u014dtenketsu. It consist of four acts, where the first two introduces something, the third introduces a second element and the fourth connects the previous acts. You find <a href="http://stilleatingoranges.tumblr.com/post/25153960313/the-significance-of-plot-without-conflict" rel="nofollow">an example here</a> in form of a comic.<br/><br/>If I step up a level, what conflict and kish\u014dtenketsu both have in common is uncertainty. Both can bring suspense or curiosity. I said in the previous headline that "yes creates adventure". What that standpoint also does is avoiding conflicts. This game that I've created has no conflict in it. The plot is already there, and the suspects can never lie, although they can half of the times answer in an evasive manner.<br/><br/>I'm kind of tired of the heavy focus on conflicts that most storytelling and Forge games have.

The human trait.  <br/>I am proposing that a game engine might be built using curiosity rather than conflict as the motivating driver.</blockquote>\nAh, of course. It would be interesting to see a structure that produces either curiosity or suspense without involving conflict. I did some reading about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_%28process%29" rel="nofollow">conflict</a> on Wikipedia and it seems that the word only means "conflict of interest" when I also included obstacles in the definition, like the locked door. One thing of many definitions of games is Bernard Suits' "voluntary effort to overcome unnecessary obstacles", meaning a game is designed to be inefficient. The people playing it need to put effort in what they are doing.<br/><br/>A game also needs uncertainty so things don't get predictable but, what I feel happens in roleplaying game design, is that people throw these two together. There must be one fighting (effort) against something else (uncertainty). In The Murder of Mr Crow, I separated these. It's an effort to make up connections between the people involved, but it's uncertainty to hear what others contribute with. I wonder if separating effort and uncertainty is the way to go if you want a system that creates curiosity or suspense without having to rely on conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434033/#Comment_434033" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-18T14:30:55+00:00" title="June 18, 2014  2:30PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2014 2:31PM by Rickard.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/433568#Comment_433568" rel="nofollow">From another thread</a>.\n<blockquote>* Why is it important to roll the die in the open?

It bothered me somehow, and a discussion on another forum made me realize why.<br/><br/>MAKE PEOPLE GROK; THROUGH THEME; THROUGH WHAT THE GAME RESULTS IN; THROUGH DEMANDS OF THE PARTICIPANTS<br/>To grok something is not only to understand it, but to also to realize it's purpose. I failed to explain that in this game, where I think it would be obvious that the die should be rolled in the open in a game where the sole purpose is, not to compete with or frame each other, but to take each others' ideas, listen to them and help everyone, in collaboratively way, creating a scenario together. For me, it was obvious that the die roll should be made in the open, so others can take that into account when they improvise together with the person who rolled the die. The game shouldn't create any uncertainties of why people are there together\u2014of what purpose they are there for.<br/><br/>To be able to make someone grok the game's structures, I think that the author must first present the theme of the game and what the game will do. I did that, but what I didn't realize was that I also need to tell what's demanded of everyone playing the game. What I then should had done is to make every structure strengthen either the theme, what the game is about or what's demanded of the participants. I think that if I had done that in a good way, that question about the die wouldn't had been asked. I will take this insight with me into the next game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DaveyJJ" title="DaveyJJ"><img alt="DaveyJJ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DaveyJJ">DaveyJJ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437600/#Comment_437600" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-21T10:35:02+00:00" title="August 21, 2014 10:35AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2014 12:57PM by DaveyJJ.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Rickard,<br/><br/>Yes, it makes sense. We play it and as I mentioned in the other thread, have "modded" it to make it more of the setting (1950s post-war England, though we sometimes go 1930s) and style we want to play. No changes to the mechanics, but we have done the following:<br/><br/>- We use titles + first name(s) + last name = <b>Name</b>. Mr. George Halliwell and Sir James Edwards come to mind.<br/>- We create a number of "professions" (roles) appropriate to each game's setting. Gardener, banker, lawyer, vicar, gentleman, Major, lord or lady of the manor, author, actress, artist, gadfly, Aunt, &amp;c.<br/>- We brainstorm three objects/heard/noticed per player that are appropriate to the specific game we want to play based on setting each game. We've called these <b>Importants</b>. Importants that work in a blue-collar seaside village murder won't necessarily work in an country estate outside Oxford.<br/>- We sometimes bring one character (or their relative) from the <i>previous</i> mystery into the current one. The connections add a neat twist.<br/>- We sometimes have the detective played by a single player the entire game (often named Inspector Albert Swinton, the name of a character I write narrative RPGs online in Storium).<br/>- We re-typeset the PDF (I'm a designer of 25 years) to make it more suited in terms of visual look to the setting we play.<br/><br/>As I said, we like the game a lot over our five plays and find ourselves creating quite imaginative murders. The last one involved the tragic murder of Emily Millbridge the village librarian, a rather stunning diamond, the theft of a seemingly innocuous book, and a dead crow. Everyone was aghast when it was discovered that the murderer was none other the Lady Olivia Howard.<br/><br/>If you like, I can send along the PDF to you.<br/><br/>Addendum: We pass the role for he detective clockwise around the table if not single player, though one game we did just see who wanted to take that role next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437604/#Comment_437604" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-21T12:56:04+00:00" title="August 21, 2014 12:56PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I would love to hear one of your sessions. xD The dead cow had me.

Can I have a look at the PDF?<br/><br/>Never worry about spreading that document around. I just want people to play it, and your variant is a great example of how I want people to treat the game. Think of the original text as protected by Common Creative, if any doubt occurs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DaveyJJ" title="DaveyJJ"><img alt="DaveyJJ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DaveyJJ">DaveyJJ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437606/#Comment_437606" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-21T13:19:52+00:00" title="August 21, 2014  1:19PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2014 6:38AM by DaveyJJ.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Crow, not cow. :-) A dead black bird delivered in the night as a warning to a local councilman, it turned out. Though a dead bovine would be funnier and cooler.<br/><br/>We create a fixed number of Importants (we couldn't come up with a better name) each session; usually two or three are suggested by each player. So they change from game to game, depending on the setting of the murder. We have some that have repeated a few times (overheard phone conversation, a delivery of goods, a missing letter, the theft of something important) but for the most part we decide on a Setting in a few minutes and then start the process of naming Suspects, creating professions/roles that fit the Setting, and then Importants.<br/><br/>We do not necessarily use all of the Importants we come up with, no. It's nice to have extra though because we sometimes use them as "red herrings".<br/><br/>I've sent our PDF along via email to show you. It's a sort of 1950s-styled "Penguin" cover book, taking our cue from Graham Walmsley, but only a handful of pages. <br/><br/>Our play sessions, while not "dark", three of the five games have taken place in the early 1950s so rationing, the breakdown of class, and a general "greyness" and post-war weariness are common themes we tend to include. The next one might skirt into the political realm of the "Red Menace". The other two set in the 1930s were much lighter and one was quite full of comedic elements and situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DaveyJJ" title="DaveyJJ"><img alt="DaveyJJ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DaveyJJ">DaveyJJ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437620/#Comment_437620" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-22T04:22:11+00:00" title="August 22, 2014  4:22AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If anyone else is interested I can post the PDF our group created.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437622/#Comment_437622" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-22T06:07:16+00:00" title="August 22, 2014  6:07AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2014 9:27AM by Rickard.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the layout.
