                    Ben Lehman expanded the Big Model ideas to include "Technical Agenda" in <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://benlehman.blogspot.com/2005/10/introduction-to-forge-theory-5.html" rel="nofollow">this post</a> on his blog.<br/>
<br/>
To wit:<br/>
<br/>
<i>Over in the techniques category, we have <b>Technical Agenda</b>, which is, in short, what we want our rules to do. Do we want rules that empower a single player as a GM? Do we want rules which emulate the physics of the world? Do we want rules which empower all players equally? Any of these things could be considered a technical agenda -- and any given system (set of rules) is going to have a number of technical agenda. Generally, speaking, the technical agenda is pretty much the realm of the designer, however, we've already established that all gamers are game designers, and often design on the fly during play, so it certainly concerns us as gamers. Essentially, technical agenda boils down to: What do you want the rules to do?</i><br/>
<br/>
This clicked with me instantly. I came into designing my LARP system <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.grapevinelarp.com/EndsAndMeans" rel="nofollow">Ends and Means</a> knowing that there were certain (Narrativist) things I wanted it to do creatively. But I also realized that many of the best designs for those creative goals were off-limits -- because they will not work for Live-Action.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, I had a <i>Live-Action</i> Technical Agenda. My system could not incorporate unwieldly randomizers (like dice pools). It needed to give lots of space for mechanic-free dialogue and interaction. It could not depend on an omnipresent GM. And so on.<br/>
<br/>
During prep for my playtests, I noticed several players speculate on whether my system would be immersive or not (they didn't use the i-word, but that was their gist). That got me analyzing my system on that front, which led to the thought: is Immersion covered by the Technical Agenda idea as well?<br/>
<br/>
An Immersive Technical Agenda would (like LARP) be supported by a system that gives lots of space for free dialogue and interaction. It is supported by low search and handling time. It is arguably damaged by personality mechanics. And so on.<br/>
<br/>
Once I start hitting specifics as above, naturally I realize and acknowledge that there are many ways to set up an Immersive Technical Agenda, according to whatever you think "Immersion" is. There are dozens of ways to set up a LARP Technical Agenda, according to what you want "LARP" to be. The Scandinavian LARP scene is famous for doing both at once.<br/>
<br/>
Do these observations seem sound? Are they a servicable application of Ben's "Technical Agenda" ideas? To these observations help anyone recognize other common Technical Agendas?                </div>
