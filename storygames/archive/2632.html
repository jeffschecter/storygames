(There seem to be connection problems right this minute...)<br/><br/>I think LARPS, even without props, are a good entry point for new players because they're closer to things they already know. In the case of LARPs, space to move around effectively becomes the important prop. In a ttrpg, the table is just something to sit at and roll dice on, lean on to write. In a LARP, it''s the Big Boss' table at the local Speakeasy, the living room is the hoity-toity gal's mansion, the deck is the yacht and the basement is the mad scientist's lab.<br/><br/>On top of that, even non-gamers <b>do</b> roleplay under the right circumstances. Watch what happens at an adult Halloween or Mardi Gras party. People will begin to act in-character, spontaneously creating vignettes as their characters. Sure, they'll drop in and out of character (unlike log-time hobbyists), but the basics are there.<br/><br/>I guess I'm saying that the tabletop, sans board or cards, are something that long term hobbyists can evolve to appreciating, but may actually be a little constraining and unfamiliar to new folks.<br/><br/>BTW, doesn't John Wick talk about playing Cat with kids and moving around the house to describe where the action is taking place, making it an almost LARP kind of thing ( or similar to The Nighttime Animmals Save the World where the players use the physical surroundings as inspiration for the story events)? Maybe it wasn't John, but someone else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
