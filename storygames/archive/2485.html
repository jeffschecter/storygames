                    I'm thinking about a Paranoia LARP at GenCon, possibly set around a Fun Ball tournament (Fun Ball is the Paranoia equivalent of football).<br/><br/>Could you help by throwing out random ideas: objectives for players, things that might happen during the game? Mine so far are...<br/><br/>1. There should be a massively powerful thermonuclear device, which looks exactly like the Fun Ball, but which luckily <i>will never get substituted for the Fun Ball</i>.<br/><br/>2. Stealing the Fun Ball itself should probably be part of it.<br/><br/>3. I sort of want a Cthulhu-esque secret society who use the Fun Ball tournament as some sort of massive apocalyptic ritual.<br/><br/>4. I'm thinking that, in true WWF style, there should be a Good Guy team and a Bad Guy team. The Bad Guy team should all be dressed as communists.<br/><br/>Brainstorm?<br/><br/>Graham                </div>

                            You'll actually make them play Fun Ball, right?  In front of spectators?  Because that would be rad (especially if they are playing with a nuke).<br/><br/>Maybe the Bad Guy team is a sort of punishment battalion, and if they win the Fun Ball match they (theoretically) get their criminal records expunged.  So they are, perhaps, actual communists.  It'd be a nice set-up for some "dirty dozen" desperate PCs.  <br/><br/>I don't know about Fun Ball, but I imagine team responsibility breaks down along clearance lines, with the least competent members calling plays and the actual rules being classified above their level.                        </div>

                            Well, I can only assume that since this is Paranoia, the rules of the game will be completely unknown to the majority of participants. And that they will change several times throughout the game, possibly as the result of player activity?                        </div>

                            Hey Graham, just checking on the Gen Con thing.  Some day we shall meet!  Anyway, were I you I'd engineer it so that the "rules" required them to move safely and slowly, rather than hand-waving it and telling them to play in slow motion.  Or even better, moving quickly, due to some quirk of the game/ball/stadium/nearby security bot/etc will result in brutal termination.  <br/><br/>What if the Fun ball (the one that isn't actually a nuclear weapon) was being used to transmit some secret society message?  So obtaining it and soaking it in water to reveal the coded instructions was somehow key?  That sort of thing could involve stealing the Fun Ball, finding the traitors, &amp;c.                        </div>

Perhaps moving too quickly will inadvertantly trigger the motion sensors on the stadium security lasers, accidentally killing the unfortunate speedster?                        </div>

                            My paranoia-fu is strictly 2nd edition, so a lot of the references may be dated. Having said that, here's some ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Have a couple of VIPs (High Programmers?) These are NPCs and are the only people who know the full rules of Fun Ball. They support different teams and hate each other.<br/>
<br/>
Each VIP has some high-ish (Green?) clearance guards. These can be PCs and if so they should have treasonous secret objectives (bump off the other VIP, bump off your <i>own</i> VIP, steal the rules of the game, etc)<br/>
<br/>
The teams themselves consist of PCs with orders to throw the game, eliminate rival players, or commit random mayhem.<br/>
<br/>
Have a couple of PCs who are not guards, but have an objective to "protect" one or other of the VIPs (maybe they're in the same society.) Bonus points for giving these guys rumours that implicate <i>loyal</i> guards in a murder plot.<br/>
<br/>
Have several "assassins" with orders to kill one or more of the VIPs, or star players on one or other team.<br/>
<br/>
At least two people should be trying to blow up the stadium. The bombs should look exactly like the Fun Ball.<br/>
<br/>
R&amp;D want to test a new improved Fun Ball and have hired someone to switch their version for the real Fun Ball so it can be tested.<br/>
<br/>
Some people have to be in charge of crowd/stadium security. You can have lots of fun with this.<br/>
<br/>
The referee should be a PC. He knows none of the rules of Fun Ball. He is given a document with the rules, except most of the information is replaced with "THIS INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE AT YOUR SECURITY CLEARANCE". Add some totally stupid rules added by some traitor. Remember that displaying any actual (even accidental) knowledge of the rules at a lower security clearance is treason<br/>
<br/>
Someone is a spy from another Alpha Complex (or some other plot device), and doesn't know the communists are fake.<br/>
<br/>
At least one of the "communist" team is a real communist. Another communist is in the crowd and has been given orders to meet up with his contact, but hasn't been told which one of the communists is real.<br/>
<br/>
The ticket vending bots (you do have NPC bots, right?) go berserk halfway during the match.<br/>
<br/>
Someone has hidden an important Maguffin <i>inside</i> the real Fun Ball.<br/>
<br/>
Have lots of secret socety recognition phrases and handshakes - but mix up the information so that about 2/3rds of them are incorrect and refer to other people's secret societies.                        </div>

                            Jason, that's brilliant. Having finding the rules of the game as a shared mission gives the players a reason to cooperate, which is just as important as having reasons to screw each other over.<br/>
<br/>
Also, perhaps give each player a questionnaire on the rules of Fun Ball? First player to get all 10 questions right (or quickest to get most answers right) wins a prize (maybe the Fun Ball itself, or a Fun Ball trophy.) And is then executed for treason.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and at least one of the rules has to involve a silly dance of the Old Reckoning.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a PA available at the event? If so, a couple of the event organisers can act as commentators. Then have them executed for treason halfway through and make one of the <i>players</i> take the mike.                        </div>

NPCs are a little tricky in LARPs: it's usually best to keep the players interacting with each other rather than NPCs. But there's definitely the possibility to turn the NPCs into PCs and do something similar.
<blockquote>The teams themselves consist of PCs with orders to throw the game, eliminate rival players, or commit random mayhem.</blockquote>
Throwing the game! Of course. Oh, and there should be some Free Enterprisers taking bets on the game, too, and offering bribes to make the game go the right way.<br><br>Orders to protect/assasinate star players, nice.

All those are wonderful.

That's evil. Yes. In the way of these things, there should be a couple of referee PCs. They can make different rulings and fight.
<blockquote>Someone is a spy from another Alpha Complex (or some other plot device), and doesn't know the communists are fake.</blockquote>
Yes...or someone's from Internal Security and has been briefed to terminate anyone in Communist garb "with extreme prejudice", even though they know they're fake. It'd be fun seeing if they disobey those orders.
<blockquote>At least one of the "communist" team is a real communist. Another communist is in the crowd and has been given orders to meet up with his contact, but hasn't been told which one of the communists is real.</blockquote>
Yes, that's nice.
<blockquote>The ticket vending bots (you do have NPC bots, right?) go berserk halfway during the match.</blockquote>
Again, there's a bit of an NPC problem there, since you want to keep the conflicts between players, if possible. But I like the idea.
<blockquote>Someone has hidden an important Maguffin<em>inside</em>the real Fun Ball.</blockquote>
Oooh. Yes. Well, there's always the option to have different Fun Balls: one has a McGuffin inside, one has a secret society message...
<blockquote>Have lots of secret socety recognition phrases and handshakes - but mix up the information so that about 2/3rds of them are incorrect and refer to other people's secret societies.</blockquote>
Oh, yes, absolutely. Or tell a Free Enterpriser that there's a very valuable "Platinum Fun Ball". Then tell a Psion member that "Platinum Fun Ball" is a codeword for "mutant".

                            You know, Graham, if your Fun Balls are foam rubber, you could slit them and actually stuff notes inside them.  Or core them and insert film containers.  You've probably already thought of that.                        </div>

                            It seems to me that the High Programmers would be perfectly workable PC roles, so long as they didn't have any actual <i>weight</i> to throw around (just their protected status).  Their enemies are the other High Programmers, and the lower ranked people are their pawns.<br/>

Spice that up with various Spurious-Logic subroutines that they've each inserted into the computer's programming concerning the other guys, and life gets good.<br/>

"Virtue will win out over communism.  If citizen Ivana-U-DED is virtuous then she will support a winning team.  Therefore if the team she supports does not win the FunBall, she is a communist!"<br/>

Ivana, of course, has to know about that sub-routine (as well as whatever sub-routines she's laid to destroy her enemies).  Remember ... these guys reprogram the laws of reality, but imperfectly.  The fun is both seeing them caught in their own trap and seeing how their arrogant meddling screws with everybody below them.                        </div>

What systems (beyond talking to each other) do you use for this LARP? Apart from my general interest in all things Paranoia, it would help me to think about what is and isn't workable.<br/>
<br/>
Re: the High Programmer NPCs. Agree that NPCs are a pain, but if you go with the "discover the rules" thing, I think you need some people who do know the correct rules and they cannot be PCs. Plus they can call rules violations from the sidelines during the Fun Ball game itself.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, another new idea. A cheap way of identifying the "commie" team - give them all revolutionista berets with red stars on them. This also makes it easy to swap roles during the game. Perhaps one of the red stars is also required for the Cthuloid ritual.<br/>
<br/>
If I don't get the ENnies job, I think I'm going to come to GenCon UK just to see this game.                        </div>

                            Let's see. There are so many good ideas there that it's hardly worth me going through each of them and going "That's great". But they are.<br><br>To answer specific things...<br><br>Mike, there'll probably be twelve to fifteen players, so fairly small.<br><br>Costumes: often people dress up specifically for LARPs. Having said that, I'm not a fan of costumes, so I'm always happy for people to just turn up. Commie jerseys or berets are a great idea. Or armbands, perhaps.<br><br>System: it's not planned yet. But the interesting thing about LARP systems is how light they can be and still be workable. For example, there needn't be any conflict resolution system beyond GM fiat (which might be used once or twice during the game). Most of the system will likely consist of giving the characters objectives and perhaps powers (e.g. "Mutant Power Sensitivity: If another player uses their mutant power near you, you can tell what it is (ask the player)"; "Telepathy: You can send messages to other characters, without being overheard. To do this, whisper to the player."). There's a bloke called Iain who's interested in helping design the system.<br><br>The idea of constructing the ruleset is nice (and workable). When I first thought of this idea, I'd thought of leaving the players completely in the lurch: they didn't know the rules and there was no way of finding out the rules, so they'd just have to be entertaining. I'd imagined them not actually playing a real game, but acting as though they were (doing silly dramatic leaps and dives; pretending to score incredible goals; and so on).<br><br>If there actually is a ruleset - whether it's constructed or hidden from the players - then the players would actually have to play. It's definitely possible. I'm not sure.<br><br>Do keep ideas coming.<br><br>Graham                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            i think actually telling them how to play fun ball is a mistake.  it would be boring, and possibly time consuming.  fun ball is the setting, not the story.  the story is something outside of fun ball, so put your(and their) time into that.  i think it'll naturally be chaotic even if you create simple rules, and really it'll be much more fun if there are no rules.  fun ball should mirror the Computer.  and really the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Computer isn't much fun</span><b>THE COMPUTER IS FUN!</b><br>you could show a film of "how to play fun ball", but fake it looking like the vidplayer is on the fritz, by speeding up the film, like fast forwarding a vcr tape.  hmmm...you could explain to the players that "the rules of fun ball normally take four hours to watch, but though a miracle of science, our highly advanced research and development team have shortened the learning time to <i>just</i> roughly five minutes!" <br>is there going to be a group goal or misson goal?<br>are there going to be secret goals?<br>heck just make a video "mix tape" of wacky stuff, clowns, hobos, burlesque dancers, superheros, cowboys, devo, curling, sumo wrestlers, sword fighting, a guy being shot out of a cannon, synchronized swimmers...etc, and show it while on fast forward.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I agree with Nate above that the actual playing of Fun Ball should not take up the players time.  One option is to use the behind the scenes option.  Through those doors, point to big double doors already in room or fake doors duct taped to wall, is the Fun Ball arena with thousands of happy citizens and High Programmers and Vulture Squadron Referees awaiting the Fun Ball championships.  You dozen citizens have been rounded up at the last minute because both championship Fun Ball teams were just shot for being commie mutant traitors.  You have X hours before those doors open.  Good luck!<br>
<br>
So describing the resulting game of Fun Ball becomes the epilogue at the end of the session based on all the locker room hijinks of the payers.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, determine that Fun Ball is invariably a very lethal game such that there are five minute periods with hour long breaks in between for new clones to arrive and make up new teams.  This way, the hunting down of rules and traitors takes up the majority of the time with brief breaks for slaughtering each other on the Fun Ball court.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Graham, thanks for the extra info!<br/>
<br/>
12 to 15 is nice and manageable, the main question is whethr you are going to have Fun Ball Teams. If so, that doesn't leave much space for other roles.<br/>
<br/>
I still think that an actual game of Fun Ball at the end would be nice. Do you remember <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_Game" rel="nofollow">The Adventure Game?</a> There was always a game at the end where the contestants would be vaporised if they got the rules wrong. Seems like a neat idea to steal (not the actual Vortex, the pacing - no one can "die out" of the game except at the very end. Whoever survives the longest is the winner!<br/>
<br/>
If you're looking for an ultra-light system, I'd try to avoid mutant powers, as these have to be explained in play. I think the true core experience of Paranoia is the political backstabbing and trading of (often false) information and powers don't necessarily add anything to that.<br/>
<br/>
Costume idea: give everyone an induction parcel with a security clearance pass and any necessary props (for example, the berets, loyalty officer badges, wildly inaccurate briefing notes for the Fun Ball game, rumours and secret orders.). The passes are all large badges marked "Hello! My Name is (left blank) and I am (role)!" A couple of the passes have been treasonously modified to read "Hello! My Name is _____ and I am a Traitor! Down with the Computer!" Of course, not wearing your pass is Treason.                        </div>
