We're drawing a lot from BSG, Star Trek, Firefly, and Mass Effect without leaning too heavily on any one intellectual property. The *W games do an awesome job of exploring a setting, and Rob and I both thought exploring space would be a lot of fun.<br/><br/>In essence, you pick character playbooks like normal and then pick a ship playbook that helps to define the universe and your ship. Part of our goal is to make the ship into a character as well, albeit one that everyone plays together. <br/><br/>We've got five playbooks (Captain, XO, Doctor, Cadet, and Engineer) done, as well as three ships (Flagship, Warship, Freighter). You can download all of them, including the basic moves, ship moves, and MC guide here:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/efdlj2mqaaygywp/Star%20World%20PDFs.zip" rel="nofollow">Star World 1.0</a><br/><br/>At this point, we'd love to get some feedback on this thing. I've gone out and roadtested it four or five times and had a great time, but we are eager to hear what others think. We've made use of <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17665/apocalypse-world-a-more-descriptivevisceral-approach-to-harm" rel="nofollow">the alternate harm mechanics that were first outlined by Paul_T here on Story Games</a>.

But, for my part (and not to speak for <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T%29">@Paul_T)</a>, I think I would personally be more interested in having the characters defined by their personal strengths and shortcomings of character, and then see how those strengths make them effective at their post. In other words, I'd rather see a game where Cool made me an outstanding pilot as well as an impressive fencer, rather than a game where Helm made me an impressive fencer, if that makes sense. It's just a difference of emphasis but I think it has the potential to add some colour. Maybe something like Cool, Charm, Grit, Skill (as in technical facility), and Lore...? I'd suggest making them all adjectives that describe someone's personality (like in AW), or all nouns that describe personal features (as I did in my list).<br/><br/>How do XP and Advances work in this game? Same as AW? What are the advances?<br/><br/>Is there a mechanical difference between Exhausting a Link and Breaking it?<br/><br/>When I replace an Exhausted/Broken Link with a new one, are you going to have a master list of "advanced Links" with their XP conditions, or is that something the MC should make up? Can the advanced Links also be Exhausted and/or Broken?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401887/#Comment_401887" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T21:27:22+00:00" title="December 27, 2012  9:27PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 27, 2012 9:28PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [edit: cross-posted with the above post!]<br/><br/>Hmmm. Let's see:<br/><br/>The first three are just fine. I just don't like the names! (I would use Command for Helm, and Instinct for Tactics, maybe.)<br/><br/>But Engineering is really "use tech", right? At least based on the moves as written. That might be fine, or it might be too limiting. I'm not sure what it has to do with "thinking critically".<br/><br/>Science sounds like it should be broader in scope, like "Reason" or something, and there should be some other ways to use it. Some other moves, maybe. I don't know if the "open your brain" move is the right thing for this. <br/><br/>Both could potentially use some other moves, perhaps phrased like the "reading" moves (you get to ask the MC questions from a list). <br/><br/>This is not a very well thought-out criticism! Just a gut reaction.<br/><br/>Two other things:<br/><br/>1. I read through the playbooks, and I really like the Cadet! Lots of fun stuff in there.<br/><br/>2. You never actually explain Links or how they work (especially when it tells you to take a new one). It's an interesting idea, though: it's like a personal relationship Key. Can you tell us more about how these work?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MarkT" title="MarkT"><img alt="MarkT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/983/nP0EE6Z6XSTVP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MarkT">MarkT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401893/#Comment_401893" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T22:54:24+00:00" title="December 27, 2012 10:54PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/creases">@creases</a> - Thanks for the feedback! <br/><br/>1) The alien thing is stolen from Ryan Macklin: <a href="http://ryanmacklin.com/2012/09/generating-a-sci-fi-race-dynamic/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ryanmacklin.com/2012/09/generating-a-sci-fi-race-dynamic/</a> <br/><br/>It works our really, really well in play. Usually I put forward a new alien species and then ask the players to pick from a list of three: "Are the Ga'rinat more wealthy, more influential, or more aggressive than humans?" It's a neat way to get the players to build the universe and declaim responsibility.<br/><br/>2) Yeah, I can see where you and Paul are coming from with the Stat names. We weren't trying to define the characters by their jobs as much as we were trying to give a name to the kinds of stats that fit the fiction. It's possible the names aren't really helping that. We'll have to think about it.<br/><br/>3) Advancing the characters works like AW. You mark XP up to 5, then advance in one of the following ways: raise a stat, add a move, etc. We're still working out how we want that to work exactly, but it will be similar to AW. Maybe even have a way to advance the basic moves? Would love your feedback here...<br/><br/>4) The mechanical difference for Exhausting vs. Breaking is what the next link will be in your "Chain." So if you exhaust a link, it means that you have sorted of played that relationship out and it needs to advance. For example, if you start with the Father Figure link (as the Cadet) and then Exhaust it, you end up as your Mentor's Sidekick. If you break a link, it means that the relationship changes in a dramatic fashion. If you have Father Figure and Break it, you end up as the prodigal protege of your former mentor.<br/><br/>The advanced links that compose a chain will be provided (although you could obviously make up your own). Eventually they will lead to new chains (like becoming close friends with your mentor) or new Playbooks (like getting promoted). Here's the full chain for the Cadet:<br/><br/><b>Father Figure</b><br/><br/>__________ is your mentor, whether they like it or not. Mark XP when you go to them for advice on a problem.<br/>- Exhaust this Link by gaining your mentor\u2019s respect. Claim an Advance and take <i>Sidekick</i>.<br/>- Break this Link by publicly acting against your mentor\u2019s advice. Claim an Advance and take <i>Prodigal Child.</i><br/><br/><b>Sidekick</b><br/><br/>__________ has taken you under their wing. Mark XP when they intervene in a situation you can\u2019t solve by yourself.<br/>- Exhaust this Link by embarrassing yourself in front of your mentor. Claim an Advance and take <i>Father Figure</i>.<br/>- Break this Link by publicly ignoring your mentor\u2019s advice. Claim an Advance and take <i>Prodigal Child</i>.<br/><br/><b>Prodigal Child</b><br/><br/>You have a hostile relationship with your former mentor, __________. Mark XP when you argue with them about your future.<br/>- Exhaust this Link by coming to terms with your mentor\u2019s influence. Claim an Advance and take <i>Colleague At Last</i>.<br/>- Break this Link by resigning your commission and joining the crew. Claim an Advance and take the <i>Chief Playbook</i>.<br/><br/><b>Colleague At Last </b><br/><br/>You\u2019ve earned __________\u2019s respect as a fellow officer. Mark XP when you suggest a plan that they support.<br/>- Exhaust this Link by saving a crewmember\u2019s life. Claim an Advance and take <i>Band of Brothers</i>.<br/>- Break this Link by taking command when the Captain is unable to lead. Claim an Advance and take the <i>XO Playbook</i><br/><br/>Does it make more sense with the full chain?<br/><br/>Thanks again for reading it over!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> - Glad you like the Cadet. I think it's a fun playbook.<br/><br/>I answered some of your questions above (Stats/Links), but I totally get where you're coming from. I'll have to think about it more to see if there might be some Stat names that fit the fiction better. <br/><br/>As for the limited moves around Engineering/Science, we tried to limit the basic non-ship moves so that we don't overwhelm the players. AW has 8 moves for 5 stats, and I think we're in the same ballpark, and we've got 5 ship moves to add after the basic moves. Engineering and Science both have bigger roles to play in the ship moves, so hopefully that balances out some of the limits in the basic moves. <br/><br/>That said, I'm totally open to new ideas. Any idea what you would want to see added for Engineering/Science moves?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401896/#Comment_401896" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T23:05:31+00:00" title="December 27, 2012 11:05PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I missed the ship moves!<br/><br/>I guess I would want to use those stats to build gadgets or modify tech, figure out what alien technology does, that sort of thing.

Hope some of it is useful.<br/><br/>On the list of MC moves "introduce a new alien species" is weird. Somebody fails a roll and it's because of a new alien? Not quite sure I follow.<br/><br/>The generation of alien species seems like half of the "more than human / less than human" from My Life With Master. I would add the "less than human" part back. "The Krishlik are more wealthy than us but lack compassion." Check out Durance's planet and society generation for another take on this idea.<br/><br/>I agree that there's a huge disconnect between the names of the stats and what you use them for. Why do I Hold Steady with Helm instead of something else? Just seems arbitrary. In general, the basic moves seem to be more or less identical to Apocalypse World, aside from harm and the tech move ("act under fire" is even mentioned in Manipulate, despite it not existing in this hack, yeah?). I'd be more excited about a hack that really changed the core moves or invented new ones that matched the source material better. Otherwise, why not make it, like, a 5-page set of notes for making some alterations to Apocalypse World rather than going to all this trouble for something that's not that different.<br/><br/>In contrast, I really like most of the ship moves, though I'm not sure how Hailing Frequencies is supposed to work (are you talking to people on the other ship? but you ask questions of the MC?) and I think some of the questions in Assess a Tactical Situation could be better. The others seem pretty cool, even if some are reminiscent of other moves.<br/><br/>Of the playbooks, the Cadet's moves are really really cool and kind of hilarious. Well done! The moves in the other playbooks strike me as overly mechanical in many cases, being mostly things that are divorced from the fiction (roll a different stat, use this move instead of that move, take +1 to something) which renders them mostly invisible in play and therefore makes the different playbooks seem less different. That's an easy trap to fall into in many hacks. Nobody will notice if a character is rolling a different stat, for the most part, but everyone will notice if a move forces them to actually do something that's very evocative of their fictional role.<br/><br/>Finally, the ships look pretty cool. I think I would need to see them in play to have more intelligent comments about them.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's my initial reaction.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MarkT" title="MarkT"><img alt="MarkT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/983/nP0EE6Z6XSTVP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MarkT">MarkT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402134/#Comment_402134" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-29T22:13:48+00:00" title="December 29, 2012 10:13PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">@J_Walton</a> - Totally useful. We're just throwing this out there to see what people think, so your brain dump is much appreciated.<br/><br/>First, you're right that the introduce a new species is weird. I had the idea that introducing a new social relationship would be a good "soft move," but you're right that it doesn't line up at all. We need to send that one back to the drawing board. <br/><br/>I like the idea of adding in something like Durance's planet and society generation. The alien generation system works well, though, because it's so light. Do you think it might bog it down to have people picking two things?<br/><br/>Your feedback on the stats are much appreciated. On one hand, we were trying to pull some basic ideas together without reinventing the wheel, but I'm also getting a better sense of the larger kinds of changes we could make. I'm excited to try to figure out ways to get at the source material better, and I do think there's a larger game here beyond a 5 page hack (even if it's not quite there yet).<br/><br/>Hailing Frequencies doesn't work. This is our third try at it, and I just playtested it. Totally doesn't make any sense. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Same goes with the questions in "Assess a Tactical Situation." I think the overall move makes sense, but we're having trouble nailing the specifics.<br/><br/>Glad you like the Cadet! I think that one really does have a special zing to it. I can totally see what you're saying about the other playbooks. The "invisible in play" thing really is an obstacle, and it's something we can go back through an improve upon.

My brother is a big Diaspora fan, and I can't believe I forgot to check it out.<br/><br/>The primary way we are trying to deal with tech in the game is to break it into three categories:<br/><br/>Standard tech - works every time you use it, adds +1 when you use a +tag, MC can use a -tag to lower a roll by 1. ex: communicators, guns, armor, ship's computer. We think of these as fictional positioning elements that help the characters trigger moves during the game.<br/><br/>Advanced tech - works when you make a +Engineering roll, grants new and fantastic abilities or outcomes. ex: Medpacks, tricorders.<br/><br/>Advanced ship tech - works when you make a +Engineering roll, must be refreshed to use again, grants new and fantastic abilities and outcomes for the ship. ex: Transporters, fighter bays, shields.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402153/#Comment_402153" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-30T07:52:59+00:00" title="December 30, 2012  7:52AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, Mark. Sounds like we're on the same page on some stuff.<br/><br/>On the "new species" GM move, it might make sense to have something a bit broader. I'm thinking about all those Star Trek episodes where some weird force/creature possesses their ship or some crew member. Something that basically means: "show the symptoms of an alien threat" or something like that. You could even use it to, say, have the Klingon warrior in the ambassador's retinue say something threatening and cryptic, in addition to, like, having the ship's energy suddenly beginning draining away.<br/><br/>If you like your alien creation already, there's no need to change it. Maybe focusing on how they're better than humans puts a more positive spin on it anyway and pushes the game away from weird alien racism or whatever.<br/><br/>If you start working on a more unique set of basic moves, I'm happy to help out and offer feedback however I can. Basic moves can be really hard to write (I know Sage and Adam went through hundreds of versions of some of the DW moves), but are really the core of any functional AW hack.<br/><br/>For "Hailing Frequencies," I suggest just using your scan move when you want to scan another ship with your sensors, yeah? You might have to strengthen or revise the scan move a little, but it seems mostly solid already. And then, if what you want to do is negotiate or threaten the other ship's personnel over the intercoms, you should just be able to use whatever social moves you come up with (like, if this was AW, Seduce/Manipulate or Go Aggro). So maybe you don't actually need it, unless there's something else you specifically want it to do.<br/><br/>"Assess a Tactical Situation" currently looks a lot like "Read a Charged Situation." If you're having trouble coming up with the right questions, you might try a variation on "Assess the Situation" from The Regiment, which lets the players ask any questions they want, and then keep some record in playtesting of what kinds of useful questions the players tend to ask. Then, you can decide whether to keep the move open-ended or come up with a list of questions based on what information players tend to actually need.<br/><br/>In any event, a good start and I look forward to seeing where it goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MarkT" title="MarkT"><img alt="MarkT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/983/nP0EE6Z6XSTVP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MarkT">MarkT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402177/#Comment_402177" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-30T12:32:45+00:00" title="December 30, 2012 12:32PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">@J_Walton</a> - Yes!

That's exactly what I was going for when I wrote "introduce a new species." Thank you. <br/><br/>The alien racism thing is definitely something I'm already thinking about. I'm always disappointed when aliens become a cheap excuse to use stereotypes (I'm looking at you, Phantom Menace). Keeping it positive tends to reduce the times that a species ends up being used sloppily. It's something I will eventually want to deal with directly in advice to MCs.<br/><br/>I'm going to take a look this week at starting the process of developing more unique moves. What did you think of "fight with honor" vs. "fight to win"? That was one place I felt like we had captured a bit of the fiction (the choice between playing fair and fighting dirty).<br/><br/>Right, I think Open Hailing Frequencies is getting cut. I'll have to think about what I was trying to do with it. I like the assess a situation roll from The Regiment.

The whole format reeks of confusing biological structures with social ones, and what's worse, as a singular an universal type.  If x alien is "more honurable than us", then who is they and who is us?  Are they more honourable than a Japanese feudal era samurai?  Are all of them so honourable, even the ones living dirt poor on the streets?<br/><br/>Why can't aliens not just have culture, but have more than one culture?  Trying to duplicate the way TV treats aliens seems like a recipe for some truly dubious results.  It seems to me this falls between two stools - either you go the wrinkly-headed humanoid route, in which case attributing universal characteristics is riding so close to the racist line that the distinction may not even be worth mentioning, or you go for really different, alien aliens, in which case those attributes are meaningless or inappropriate or both.

We're sensitive to these issues, and we're trying to figure out a way to make the aliens have a different culture rather than just human cultures with different serial numbers. We're definitely open to different ways to approach that.<br/><br/>I think the initial "more than" structure worked well to add a Star Trek-esque kind of starting point for each culture. We're currently batting around some faction rules that would continue to complicate that starting point, and add some of the nuance that you're talking about, with different factions within each culture having a different take on what "more aggressive" or "more honorable" means in practice.<br/><br/>I also really like this Inhumanities thread, and I think it might be possible to integrate some of this kind of thinking into the game as well: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17853/six-inhumanities" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17853/six-inhumanities</a><br/><br/>Maybe it would work to start off with a broad cultural lens, as the humans may try to see all Vulcans as being the same, then have the MC pick the factions and inhumanities that deepen each alien culture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404605/#Comment_404605" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T17:15:45+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  5:15PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ima just chime in here cause my work is getting rep'd.<br/><br/>First, Star Trek is basically like militarized space anthropology. Actual anthropologists have be wringing their hands about these issues for like, sixty years now, non-stop. Do to ethnography today is to be hyper self-reflexive; to the point where many anthropologist will only study subcultures within their home culture, and even then be relentlessly self-critical.<br/><br/>However, that's just the premise - the real conceit is that what the 'aliens' in Star Trek are is a metaphor for a contemporary social issue. Vulcans are just props to explore the dangers of pure rational instrumentality; the Bajorans for issues of occupation, (religious/cultural) terrorism, Isreal/Palistine, Jews/Nazis, freedom fighting, whatever; Borg for issues of assimlation, collectivity, and technology. Especially in classic Star Trek, it was a program that dealt with issues like racism / civil rights with very clearly allegorical aliens.<br/><br/>In the that model, alien races represent human sociocultural issues made allegorical. Which is fine enough way to handle it.<br/><br/>Instead of making alien races <i>relative</i> they'd have to be <i>allegorical.</i> This might not be very satisfying, however.<br/><br/>Also, Jonathan Walton's Dark Heart is pretty critical here and would be a good place to start.<br/><br/>Star Wars is space fantasy that's highly problematic. If ya'll are going to try and emulate how it handles alien races then, well, you're pretty much fucked from an ethical standpoint. It's not really salvageable. I'm not gonna front tho.<br/><br/>If you want to do aliens like hard science fiction style, then you're in "You did not kick us, therefore you eat babies" territory. Which usually find to be a tedious thought experiment. So, I can't help you there.<br/><br/>If you want to honestly integrate Six Inhumanities, then you're gonna have to have to do this thing:<br/><br/><a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/mfiddler/hyphen/humunivers.htm" rel="nofollow">Go here.</a><br/><br/>Those are the things that all human cultures have, more or less.<br/><br/>Cross just one thing off the list that you think is interesting. <br/><br/>Proscriptions against murder. Hospitality. Facial expressions. Whatever.<br/><br/>Think about it for a bit. Speculate.<br/><br/>Write like a hundred words or so about how not having that thing in their culture works. What changes, what remains the same, why they might not have it. Otherwise, their like generic human beings. Be careful not reproduce existing cultural stereotypes. <br/><br/>Repeat until you have the number of non-human speculative cultures you want. A dozen is probably good. <br/><br/>Then just write that in terms of the intergalactic hegemony, humanity is totally (and I'm not fucking around here) at the bottom of the pile. <br/><br/>If you don't do that, I assure you your game will reproduce oppressive colonial narratives at the table every time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MarkT" title="MarkT"><img alt="MarkT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/983/nP0EE6Z6XSTVP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MarkT">MarkT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404606/#Comment_404606" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T17:24:13+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  5:24PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>However, that's just the premise - the real conceit is that what the 'aliens' in Star Trek are is a metaphor for a contemporary social issue.

I think you've gotten to the heart of that question pretty clearly.\n<blockquote><br/>If you want to do aliens like hard science fiction style, then you're in "You did not kick us, therefore you eat babies" territory. Which usually find to be a tedious thought experiment. So, I can't help you there.<br/></blockquote>\nI would agree. I think that eating babies fiction is interesting to read, but I can't imagine it be very interesting to play. I think we want alien characters to be accessible enough that the human characters can build relationships with them.\n<blockquote><br/>If you want to honestly integrate Six Inhumanities, then you're gonna have to have to do this thing:<br/><br/><a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/mfiddler/hyphen/humunivers.htm" rel="nofollow">Go here.</a><br/><br/>Those are the things that all human cultures have, more or less.<br/><br/>Cross just one thing off the list that you think is interesting. <br/><br/>Proscriptions against murder. Hospitality. Facial expressions. Whatever.<br/><br/>Think about it for a bit. Speculate.<br/><br/>Write like a hundred words or so about how not having that thing in their culture works. What changes, what remains the same, why they might not have it. Otherwise, their like generic human beings. Be careful not reproduce existing cultural stereotypes. <br/><br/>Repeat until you have the number of non-human speculative cultures you want. A dozen is probably good. <br/></blockquote>\nYeah, this is really good. I can see an MC resource that could help people do this with aliens. Thank you.\n<blockquote><br/>Then just write that in terms of the intergalactic hegemony, humanity is totally (and I'm not fucking around here) at the bottom of the pile. <br/><br/>If you don't do that, I assure you your game will reproduce oppressive colonial narratives at the table every time.</blockquote>\n<br/>I'm curious as to why you're so absolutist on this point. Isn't there room to tell stories in which the humans are the oppressors? Or do you believe that the players will take that to bad places?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_404609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404609/#Comment_404609" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T18:20:05+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  6:20PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that it all hangs on what purposes the aliens are intended to serve.  Personally, I find the use of aliens as human allegories perhaps somewhat unavoidable but also the least interesting use to which they could be put.  That is, the reason I'm interested in science fiction, and would would wish to play an SF game, is because I find the exploration of what you might call 'potential reality' interesting and entertaining, as opposed to all the other stories in which that sort of discussion of humanity is the focal point.  For me, escaping that focus, or at least, illuminating it from a tangential angle or by contrast, is more interesting.<br/><br/>And thus, for me, an approach which begins from the position of making something different to humanity for it's own sake is rather dull.  This tells me nothing about how reality is or might be, but only about what humans find strange.  It was interesting to me, as an adolescent, to read the Chanur books of CJ Cherryh, which portrayed a leonine species and consequently altered gender roles.  Although males are still dominant in certain specific senses, it is the females that run everything, do everything, make all the decisions, and hold all responsibility.  That was an interesting contrast which, by being founded on the reality of lion social structure, is more entertaining than a simple contradiction of human norms.  Another example is the aliens in Niven and Purnelle's Footfall.  These are base on elephants, and their differences in with humanity come into play in how they interpret surrender.  Not only is it more or less inconceivable to them that someone might submit and then rebel, but the only means they have of interpreting such an action is in terms of a rogue male - and so when whole human groups rebel, they think we are collectively psychotic and respond with extreme brutality.<br/><br/>Both of these examples proceed quite simply from exploring the implications of <i>non-primate</i> social structures.  They aren't just abstract counterpoints to human norms, they have a certain value and validity in terms of intellectual curiosity in their own right.  You don't have to go as far as the baby-eating aliens, which are exaggerated for comic effect, to come up with an suitably entertaining exploration of difference.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a footnote, I'm not sure all those universals really are universal, and I'm a bit annoyed to the use to which the Marx quote was put.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MarkT" title="MarkT"><img alt="MarkT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/983/nP0EE6Z6XSTVP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MarkT">MarkT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404610/#Comment_404610" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-25T18:23:08+00:00" title="January 25, 2013  6:23PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Both of these examples proceed quite simply from exploring the implications of <i>non-primate</i> social structures.

It's pretty much impossible to find these days, though, so you might email Emily and see if there's a playtest PDF from an earlier draft that she's willing to part with. I like the 2007 version with the Jenn Manley Lee cover. We just played it a while back and damn but I love what that game does.<br/><br/>The "animal allegory" is also interesting, but since humans can't communicate very meaningfully with primates and dolphins, I'm personally doubtful that we'd be able to meaningfully communicate with aliens at all, even if we recognize them as intelligent. Consequently, I tend to think that aliens are best treated as people, more or less (that's the Planarch approach for monsters, which Nathan pointed out). Humans also have fewer ethical qualms about killing animals, traditionally, so that can take it into potentially ugly territory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn" title="Pheylorn"><img alt="Pheylorn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nPL8Z6QVE6S71.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pheylorn">Pheylorn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404882/#Comment_404882" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-28T17:34:13+00:00" title="January 28, 2013  5:34PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2013 5:35PM by Pheylorn.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks tres cool!

"does this work" is, can a GM quickly generate a rich and compelling experience on the fly in the play-to-find-out context of AW. So, in a Star Trek cliche, say the players run a sensor sweep and discover a downed starship with signs of alien biology -- go. As you design your play aids, try to give the GM tools that make handling this case quickly and easy so they can get back to the game.<br/><br/>As you and others have said, there's probably reward in outside the box thinking in terms of alien biology and culture. You can always discuss this on the forums or in the game text. That's a fine mental exercise for prep; but, the moves and play sheets need to work real time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MarkT" title="MarkT"><img alt="MarkT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/983/nP0EE6Z6XSTVP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MarkT">MarkT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405169/#Comment_405169" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-31T21:51:12+00:00" title="January 31, 2013  9:51PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, yes.

Maybe, when you break a rule or principle (like the Prime Directive), the GM gets to make a move? I've used that trick in a couple AW hacks. It's good for emphasizing a certain code of conduct. There are other possibilities too, like XP-based moves that try to softly coerce you into doing things. Like: "When you follow/adhere to ABC when it's clearly not in your own best interests, mark XP" (like the Mortal in MH!). There should probably also be a move for "When you disobey a direct order."

But if you're hacking Apocalypse World, I would hope it's because you think AW has something that your game needs.  You've expressed clearly that you have different MC principles and different basic moves in mind ... but if you feel that your game needs a specific setting rather than something more organic that develops in play, then you should consider quite seriously switching to a different system or beginning to branch off from existing systems entirely and crafting your own mechanics (and, of course, grabbing whatever you see in other systems that feels right).<br/><br/>Apocalypse World is vivid, but not specific. It has a driving fiction, but not a driving <i>setting</i> exactly. It picks a few things it wants to talk about, gives the players just enough of an idea to turn the engine over and then hands the reigns to the MC and players not just to craft the characters and the plot, but also the world and the rules of the world, and even portions of the rules of the game system (custom moves are <i>awesome</i>).<br/><br/>Apocalypse World is a thematic, opinionated tool-box with some really cleverly designed tools. It is a master class in designing the right mechanical tool for the right fictional job, and in running a good game independent of your system. If nothing else, this game eases new GMs into the groove of things really, really, well.<br/><br/>If all of that still sounds like what you want, I'd be really cautious about through a specific setting in there. I know it's hard! I've got a few WIP RPGs and one of them is AW hack (another was but has since been moved to a more or less original system). Every time I hit a stumbling block, it's that genericity that gets me. Making evocative but flexible rules is hard as hell. But don't give up on the generic yet! This hack has some really interesting things to say and I think the AW mechanics can keep taking you in that direction ... including the pseudo-setting set-up AW uses.<br/><br/>I've read something from Vincent about Apocalypse world being (among many other things) a Firefly style crew of people who come from different places, have different needs, and don't necessarily like each other ... but they're all on this boat, see, and they have to deal with that. Except the boat is an apocalyptic landscape with considerably more head-room and a healthy injection of Mad Max. I've read a number of your posts that have this kind of a pseudo-setting in them. You have some things you want people playing your game to think about, things you want the mechanics to shove them into, some things you want them to experience ... but I think there's room for those things in settings as disparate Battlestar Galactica and Star Trek.<br/><br/>That said ... you can always take it WAY out there. You can bind Diaspora and Apocalypse World into unholy union--Create a system. Describe that system, with at least one planet in it. Describe some features of that system ... who lives there (if anyone), what the social structure is, what makes this planet stand out (this could be done Diaspora style, or "Pick ## of these ... now ## of these" style as in AW). Don't worry if these end up looking stereotypical or otherwise problematic unless it violates your group's Lines and Veils. Now randomly assign each of the playbooks to one of these player-made systems (you can make one too, I guess). It's ok if they aren't evenly distribute. Now players pick play-books and fill them out while keeping that system in mind. Maybe the system they're in attaches new fictional and mechanical consequences to some of the options in the play book. In any case, now it's your turn. While the players do HX, you're keeping in mind where they come from. You're making note of where you want to subvert player expectations by revealing hidden truths about this system and that system. You're looking for conflicts not just in the lives of the characters, but in the societies and landscapes they come from--and those that they don't. Honesty demands that what's on the table matters to the fiction and the system ... but you have to "Plum the depths," too and that demands nuance and subverted expectation and unexpected consequences.<br/><br/>This isn't really a solution to your specific issue ... but I think it's a nice off-the-top-of-my-head example of how to make the generic feel specific and give your players a sense of ownership of and respect for the toys you're about to bring to life--with all the joy and pain that implies. It's also an example of how to complicate <br/><i><br/>Lately I've been thinking a lot about authority and the identity of groups. I think that The Quiet Year has some fantastic ideas about the way that communities interact and deal with conflict, and I'd like to see our players grapple with similar ideas about belonging to a group (the crew). There are a lot of examples in the fiction of characters struggling with what the group demands, the needs of the many, and what they wish for themselves... </i><br/><br/>See, that sounds like the perfect type of thing for a pseudo setting! You need your set-up rules to create long term relationships with unexpected conseqeunces. You need factions or groups or oaths and precepts (or planetary systems) that bind the players to a course of action and inflict consequences when they stray. There are hints of it in your moves--I LOVE the Fight with Honor and Fight to Win dichotomy, for example. More of this sort of thing! The moves are making commentary on the play, feeding the fiction. Just like in vanilla AW. The moves set the stakes, telling you how things work around these parts. Go Aggro does a lot of work. Fight to Win does a lot of work.

Apocalypse World reads like you'd expect the author's manuscript to a Mad Max graphic novel would--the artist hasn't done anything with it yet, so you get to see the author writing things that aren't aimed at the reader of the finished project. It's unpolished, it's often informal, it's often exaggerated ... but it's evocative. Find a groove for writing about this game, and the moves are going to be ten times easier to write. Heck, write a specific setting. Then another, and another. Short stuff, maybe a page or two. Get into it, and try things until you think you have a voice to put in the player's head. Ooh, that's what I've been trying to tell myself! Sorry for rambling, my brain is a million places right now--I'm planning a research project for work, working on my own hack, thinking about yours, and fretting over whether to run The Sprawl or Star Wars World starting tomorrow as my first not-a-one-shot GMing experience (my players are cool with either, and find my indecision amusing). Anyway:<br/><br/>Here's a better way to put it: Apocalypse World doesn't just have a writer of the rule-set and an MC of the game; Apocalypse World has a narrator with a consistent and specific personality. It's in everything we get as players and it's in everything the MC gets. The MC shares the spotlight and narrates, and the players even get a bit of it ... but you never fully shake Apocalypse World's real narrator. Give your system a narrator's voice.<br/><br/>Edit: If it doesn't help, let me know ...

I think the synthesis of Fight to Win and Assess a Dangerous Situation is slick and really makes Tactics different from Sharp in a meaningful way.

AW may not have a specific setting (and that to me is indeed still a drawback) but there are a couple of caveats.  First, the <i>implicit</i> setting is pretty widely known, there's a lot of material dealing with that context in the rest of the culture, and it's not hard to see things in a suitable manner.  But here is no such commonality in "science fiction", not even in "ship-based SF".  BSG and Trek may both be set on space ships, but one of them is implicitly about a column of refugees and the other is about pure exploration.  Now I think it would be entirely possible to work up something that was about refugees without being too specific about who they are or what is pursuing them, or something about a mission of exploration without being too specific about the culture that sent them out or what stuff they might find.  But both of those forms of implicit focus could make it possible to construct rules that deal with those contexts rather then being overly vague and abstract.  The former might prompt a rule like "when a passenger transport is destroyed..." and the latter might prompt one like "When you encounter an alien culture that appears grossly immoral...".<br/><br/>In addition, the mere fact that AW has a rule for "when you open your mind to the maelstrom" says something pretty specific about how the world actually is. Some of the hardholder moves also imply some things about what there is in the world pretty firmly.   And my point about differing technologies is rather similar:  "Using advanced technology" is much less evocative than "when a transporter beam is interrupted".<br/><br/>I'm not saying you have to produce an encyclopedia, even I often find that stuff pretty dull.  But, the AW hacks have proceeded by shifting the principles of AW into different implicit contexts and thus focuses, not to mere generica.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring" title="Gwathdring"><img alt="Gwathdring" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">Gwathdring</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405481/#Comment_405481" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-05T10:38:09+00:00" title="February  5, 2013 10:38AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2013 10:39AM by Gwathdring.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Then you need to decide what you want to say about technology. I'm sure it's not just about transporter beams. Those examples sound like custom moves, again. What is your world's psychic maelstrom? In a superficial sense, it's the "Science" move ... but I mean in a fictional sense: what is always there in the setting, mutating to fit the setting but also guiding it? What do you want every player to have to face, every gaming group to have hanging around in their game to be understood fully at their collective discretion? Is it alien technology left by a precursor race? Is it The Force? Is it a collective consciousness like the psychic maelstrom? Is it an unspoken bond with your fellow soldiers/crew-mates? "When you look to your Bond for answers ..." "When you violate your Oath of Service ..."<br/><br/>Is it something in the ship itself? "When you push the ship for all it's worth ..."?<br/><br/>Consider this: Star Trek might have a different focus than BSG, but one could design a game that accurately recreated Firefly, Star Trek AND BSG by focusing on specific elements of the <i>social</i> and <i>emotional</i> setting rather than the technological and political setting. Similarly, I could make a game that encompassed Captain Kirk's and Captain Cook's voyages by focusing on the relationship between the characters and the setting (recording, exploring, understanding) rather than the setting itself.<br/><br/>I guess I disagree that Star Trek and BSG are incompatible ... but as it's your hack that's not especially important. The question than becomes which of these two do you want to talk about? Or if neither, what is the least specific  version of your setting? I'd still recommend writing out a bunch of back-of-the-book style setting spoilers and seeing what that gives you if you think you need to go back to the drawing board in outlining your setting.<br/><br/>But you seem to like the idea of a ship or fleet of ships that everyone is attached to. Like the Enterprise, the Falcon, the Galactica. You named the stats after ship-board positions. Use that maybe. Look to the ship for a move.

This is how we felt as well. I don't think they are incompatible because they have similar themes of authority, identity, and purpose.

I think other games provide some models of the former, and I think maybe what you're struggling with is how to include technobabble. If that's true, maybe it will help to reflect on why technobabble is a part of this genre, how it comes up and how the protagonists deal with it. The rumblings below are by way of suggesting one way you might approach the problem! I hope it helps!<br/><br/>Okay, so, there's no psychic maelstrom, but there surely is Space and Tech. Space is dangerous; it's inimical to organic life, and it's full of crazy astronomical phenomena like supernovas, tachyon storms, local subspace distortions, and what not. The role of tech is to make Space less dangerous.<br/><br/>There's a certain expectation of danger of the routine sort, and when Tech is working to its baseline, it creates a comfortable bubble for the crew, protecting them completely from the vacuum, from inertia effects, etc. Sometimes, there's an extraordinary Space phenomenon that Tech can be jury-rigged to address (in which case, the crew has to work as a team to make a plan and put it in action to avert danger). So, space is notionally dangerous but that danger can usually be ignored, when Tech works right; sometimes, Space is actually, imminently dangerous, when Tech fails or when a phenomenon is not routine.<br/><br/>Often, at least in Star Trek, aliens only feature in a story to raise the stakes of an astronomical disaster---it doesn't matter that they're aliens, it only matters that they're people in danger and only the crew can help.<br/><br/>Space war is only rarely about destroying the enemy, and more often about disabling Tech, leaving the enemy vulnerable to Space in order to force a surrender or withdrawal. In other words, space war is about leveraging your Tech to expose the enemy to Space. The enemy's weapons make Space more dangerous. All those routine problems like life support, interstellar travel, the ones that Tech usually keeps in the background? Enemy attacks bring them back into the foreground as active Space threats.<br/><br/>What all of this suggests to me is that maybe you should think of Space as a front that's ever present but usually in the background; and Tech as a set of linked (basic and playbook-specific) moves that the PCs can use as a team in order to fend off Space threats. Enemy ships' weapons will usually prevent or interfere with Tech moves, exposing the crew (or alien bystanders) to Space effects.<br/><br/>In other words, the PC's tech is Tech that they can interact with; the enemy's tech is Space, part and parcel with the threats posed by astronomical phenomena.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring" title="Gwathdring"><img alt="Gwathdring" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">Gwathdring</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405505/#Comment_405505" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-05T14:49:37+00:00" title="February  5, 2013  2:49PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i><br/>Space war is only rarely about destroying the enemy, and more often about disabling Tech, leaving the enemy vulnerable to Space in order to force a surrender or withdrawal.

That might speak to a change that looks less like a hack and more like a new system, though. I'm sure there are ways to do that in AW, but it's such a rich idea ... the designer in me wants to give it a mechanism. Something that mixes tactical arithmetic with push-your-luck and counter-measure. I'm envisioning a system that relies on Barriers a lot (Shields, thematically?) that are broken down or spent in various ways. A system that requires you to spread scant resources between maintaining defenses against Space and taking actions--that leads quite naturally to an action-point or dice pool system.<br/><br/>But I'm sure there are things you can do in AW that would work, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405513/#Comment_405513" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-05T15:32:12+00:00" title="February  5, 2013  3:32PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2013 3:32PM by creases.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It does potentially compete with the notion of Fight With Honor and Fight to Win which MarkT seems to like (I like it too!).

If you have an independent idea of what kind of interpersonal drama you want to have, the framework I suggested (or something like it) lets you identify ways that technology allows interpersonal drama to unfold on a scale that would otherwise be prohibited by the rigors of space---which means, that interpersonal drama can be disrupted when technology fails or when it hits a limit, or it can become dangerous in ways technology would normally not allow. Ion storms that disable transporters, and the like. The crew works on technobabble solutions that will restore some normalcy to the unfolding of the interpersonal stuff.

In other words, space war is about leveraging your Tech to expose the enemy to Space. The enemy's weapons make Space more dangerous. All those routine problems like life support, interstellar travel, the ones that Tech usually keeps in the background? Enemy attacks bring them back into the foreground as active Space threats.</blockquote>\nIn some ways, this is already in the game. When a craft takes damage, it can choose to knock out systems instead of being destroyed. And ships can target systems, leaving other ships disabled and alone in the vastness of space. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote> ... the designer in me wants to give it a mechanism.

It seems like the tradeoffs become between taking action and protecting yourself, constantly pushing the limits of what you can do at the cost of it all coming crashing down around you.

In short, tell the players to create a countdown clock for difficult problems, like repairing the transporters. Then use the story to advance the clock in meaningful ways, eventually arriving at the solution. That way the system provides some resistance (i.e. you can't resolve it in one roll), but you can take actions that lead to a solution and see that solution demarcated on your sheet.<br/><br/>I keep coming back to the idea that what we really need is a new economy to drive these kinds of conflicts. I think the most successful hacks become different games when they develop a way of thinking about conflicts that is different from AW: Monsterhearts has strings, Dungeon World has the damage system (different dice/hit points), Regiment has the Engagement table (pushing the characters to the center of the action). <br/><br/>Some of this is about combat, but mostly it's about character engagement. What should characters do? What governs those interactions, etc. I think our ship moves are working because they push the kinds of epic (but not overly detailed) scenes that fit the BSG/ST source material really well. An actual engagement table for ship battles would probably detract.

In addition, we think that there might be some value in explicitly calling on the players to define more of the setting. Here are two moves from the Captain's playbook:<br/><br/><b>Captain\u2019s Log</b>: If your ship is secure and your command unchallenged at the beginning of the session, roll+Helm. On a 10+, your troubles are minor. Pick one from your ship\u2019s list and tell the MC what's going on. On a 7-9, you pick one trouble and the MC picks one. On a miss, the MC will tell you how bad things are.<br/><br/><b>An Old Friend</b>: Declare a character an old friend and roll+Comms. On a hit, take 3 hold. You may spend the hold one for +1 on rolls involving the old friend. On a 7-9, tell the MC what you owe them and why they will call in the debt. On a 6-, tell the MC why your old friend has good reason to want you dead.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring" title="Gwathdring"><img alt="Gwathdring" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">Gwathdring</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406262/#Comment_406262" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-14T17:20:13+00:00" title="February 14, 2013  5:20PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2013 5:22PM by Gwathdring.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Captain's Log is great. If the focus is the ship, something should always be going wrong on the ship and making the player's part of that spices things up substantially. I'm a sucker for moves like that, though. Playing as an Operator made me so very happy ... I almost always missed the roll. It was glorious.<br/><br/>An Old Friend I'm torn about. I like the concept and what it says about The Captain. I'm a little less sure about how if plays out mechanically.  I'm not sure there's a natural progression from +1s on rolls that involve them, to a debt you owe them to a reason they want you dead. The latter two fit together fine, it's the leap from the first one to the others that makes it feel like it's two different effects rather than more/less successful versions of the same move.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HyveMynd" title="HyveMynd"><img alt="HyveMynd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/564/nZ3DM2UV4QM5S.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HyveMynd">HyveMynd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406272/#Comment_406272" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-14T19:45:09+00:00" title="February 14, 2013  7:45PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've only just glanced over things so far, but I am really impressed with those ship playbooks. Just the idea of giving the ship a playbook, complete with moves, is awesome. It really turns the ship into a character instead of relegating it to a mere piece of equipment.<br/><br/>Out of curiosity, is The Captain "balanced" with the other character playbooks? What I mean is, has The Captain's final say on which ship playbook gets used been factored in to the other choices they get? It looks like it, but it'd be kind of unfair if all the characters were "balanced" with each other but The Captain got to choose the ship in addition to everything else. Just saying.<br/><br/>As I said though, the concept of ship playbooks is awesome. It's helped me with ideas for faction playbooks that've been churning around in my head for a while.

My group spend the entire first session of our <i>MH</i> game figuring out their characters, their relationships to one another, their place in the school and the town, etc. It was a lot more successful than going in with nothing.

Creating playbooks and worksheets to give the players more control over the setting/story is a great idea.<br/><br/>I'd never considered the fractal nature of *W games, but I can't stop thinking about it now. Cool. As you said, not everything would need a playbook, but each element could have instincts, goals, and moves from the entire civilization all the way down to each individual person. Wow.<br/><br/>I don't have any concrete ideas for the <i>Monsterhearts</i>/<i>V:tR</i> faction books yet. One of the things I really liked about the <i>V:tR</i> game setting was the mixing of clan and covenant. With 5 clans and 5 covenants (6 if you count unaligned), you had 25 (or 30) different combinations. So my initial idea was to allow players to choose moves from clan and/or covenant playbooks at character creation or as an advance. Take both your starting moves from the Daeva Clan Skin book and you're focusing on your "familiy". Take one move from the Deava clan skin book and one from the Circle of the Crone covenant book and you're a character with a political affiliation.<br/><br/>At first, the covenant books would just give the character access to new moves and some equipment/help. But after seeing those ship playbooks of yours, I'd really love to make the covenant books "come alive". Beloning to a political group is a two way street; they'll help out members, but you have responsibilities and duties as well. Maybe something like the Operator's gigs.

For example, you might create the main group for an alien species or the human federation, and then simultaneously create a rival group that also holds sway in the society. So if the dominant group is capitalistic and transactional, the rival group might offer a perspective more collective and communal. These factions may be in conflict or they may find ways to manage that conflict productively. The characters could choose to be aligned with them or unaligned.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring" title="Gwathdring"><img alt="Gwathdring" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">Gwathdring</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406899/#Comment_406899" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-21T22:43:00+00:00" title="February 21, 2013 10:43PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2013 6:47PM by Gwathdring.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds pretty great. I'd be worried about having moves associated with the covenant, though, as Paul_T suggested unless you also give special moves to unattached individuals or include <i>plenty</i> of strings on the covenant moves. No sense in punishing unattached players mechanically unless that's part of the story your game is trying to tell.<br/><br/>General thoughts on the matter:<br/><br/>One of my favorite parts of FATE system games Diaspora and Dresden is the world creation step. You build systems or city locations; you as a player have a massive impact on the shape of the world in a concrete way. This gives everyone at the table a chance to understand what sort of a world they're leaping into without forcing the GM to front all of that. The downside is that it makes creation a fair bit longer than thus reduces the pick-up-and-play aspect of vanilla Apocalypse World significantly for the players while increasing it significantly for the MC. The players are making your fronts now, at least some of them. And they're already invested in those fronts ready for you to make obvious moves and primed for you to turn the world upside down and have it <i>mean</i> something because they have more detailed expectations for you to subvert should you choose.<br/><br/>The Sprawl (an Apocalypse World hack in a rough alpha state that I'm currently running based mostly on Gibson's cyberpunk style) also does this. Everyone at the table (MC included) creates a multi-national corporation with a rough idea of what it does. In my game, I first led the table in building the basics of a Cyberpunk future and a city in which we could start, so I added a bit to the corporation creation--define what it's up to in our city, what it's local interests seem to be. Further down the line, characters have character choices that can cause them to be "owned" or "hunted" by a corporation instead of other negative effects connecting the players, the corporations and the world together further. Finally, the "Links" (Hx) step involves everyone describing a job against one of these corporations (or governments or crime syndicates or similar) that they were central to; then there are rules for finding out what other players helped you on the job and thus who has "Links" with you. Then the corporate threat clock goes up depending on how many jobs were run against them and how many players were part of each job.<br/><br/>Now before we start playing, everyone's on board with taking part in the story-telling and fiction-crafting and letting other players (not just the MC) have a part in the authorship of the story. Everyone knows some of the major players and has explicit fictional connections with at least one of them. And I've got a bunch of corporate threats with grudges of varying strength against the players and varying levels of information about the players. I think more games should rely on the players to establish fiction like this, especially in systems that are already pretty light in the stats department. It really helps the MC and it gets people on the same page.<br/><br/>Bringing things back away from the general, I like the idea of creating factions and then deciding what their relationships with one-another would be rather than starting from the assumption that you need to create a rival for faction/Covenant x and going backwards from there.<br/><br/>Edit: I realize that I forgot to credit the creator of The Sprawl.

Corporations set themselves with and against each other as their individual agendas put them in one-another's way just like smaller NPCs do. At the end of it all, a big Covenant or faction or corporation is just a really big and wonky NPC made up of smaller NPCs. Make Faction-PC-Faction triangles, make everyone want the same territory or resources and let the conflicts happen--and let things turn the other way when it makes sense. Corporations make back-door deals to slam out mutual rivals or corner markets. They team up to take down mutual problems, like this one hacker who hits all of them and doesn't secure his lines worth a damn because he's a stupid teenager who hacks more out of reckless vandalism than criminal intent.<br/><br/>If your factions have enough body to them, connections of all sorts spring off the page. An explicit rivalry here or there is fun ... but it's a lot <i>more</i> fun when the players are on the ground feeling the tension, working for folks on both sides only to have a war or rivalry spring to life in front of their noses, or between them and their objectives. In my Diaspora game, one of the most intense moments was our being on-planet when Corvi's invasion fleet lifted off to the terrifying anti-human sermons of Creed and his fellow Ascendants while we still had to rescue a team member's father, find and talk with our one android ally in the midst of human-hating war-hungry soldiers, keep our human members our of harm's way, and then get out of dodge ... and on our way to outrun the invasion fleet to it's <i>target</i> planet so we could finish our business before war destroyed our objective. That happening in the middle of play felt a lot cooler than the historic and present conflicts we built at creation. Tension rising and breaking between factions can be a great way to guide your MCing in a game that actively discourages traditional preparation.<br/><br/>Just as Hamlet can't kill his Uncle when he first realizes the man is guilty because then the play would be over, unless the war or rivalry between factions really works best as a starting point ... don't bother making up your mind abut it until it is quite clearly important you make up you mind. No sense in ending the delicious tension before you've begun. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Hmm. Now that I think about it, Hx moves at the start of the game sort of break with this. They establish explicit relationships between the PCs. It's easy to hand-wave this off and say that the PCs are special (and they are, so that's sort of fair) but perhaps it's a chink in my perspective and I'm looking at factions all wrong. It depends on what you want the game to do. If you want the world to have an old history ... you can work that in as you go. Add details later. If you want the <i>players</i> to have an old history, you need to inform their decisions about each other from the moment a PC has the floor. Similarly, if you want the PCs to have history with an NPC or faction, you need to establish that before free-play between the PC and MC occurs involving said faction or NPC ... but Faction/Faction stuff can be more organic, and as such probably should just to avoid any unnecessary limitations or conflicts between the state of the table at creation and the state of the table further down the line.<br/><br/>Ok. I think that's a consistent line of reasoning. I apologize if this is unimportant/off-topic or whatever ... I'm mercilessly bored while waiting for a physics to happen in a vacuum chamber so I can go home after several hours of isolation and whirring machinery. As such my attempts to be relevant might be flagging a bit under the brain-weirdness of restless, energetic boredom <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MarkT" title="MarkT"><img alt="MarkT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/983/nP0EE6Z6XSTVP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MarkT">MarkT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407273/#Comment_407273" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-25T19:21:59+00:00" title="February 25, 2013  7:21PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>That happening in the middle of play felt a lot cooler than the historic and present conflicts we built at creation.

I think it's important not to lose sight of the "Play to find out what happens" agenda. It's possible to over-engineer the situation, essentially dictating all the conflicts that are going to play out instead of letting them build slowly during the course of the game.<br/><br/>It seems like there is a principle in here somewhere. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_407281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/contracycle" title="contracycle (Banned)"><img alt="contracycle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/contracycle">contracycle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407281/#Comment_407281" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-25T20:48:12+00:00" title="February 25, 2013  8:48PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you like that sort of crap, sure.<br/><br/>And yes, I'me being ostentatiously offensive there, because this is in danger of becoming another artifact of taste elevated to a truism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17755/star-world-apocalypse-world-hack-for-space-stories" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17755/star-world-apocalypse-world-hack-for-space-stories" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17755/star-world-apocalypse-world-hack-for-space-stories/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17755/star-world-apocalypse-world-hack-for-space-stories/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17755/star-world-apocalypse-world-hack-for-space-stories/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F17755%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F17755%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[Star World] Apocalypse World hack for space stories - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17755/star-world-apocalypse-world-hack-for-space-stories/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[Star World] Apocalypse World hack for space stories - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17755/star-world-apocalypse-world-hack-for-space-stories/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="I've noticed that too.

But let's take a look at what front loading means in context. This isn't a system that has stats for NPCs, so when you plan ahead you're working in rather untraditional territory. The game systems focus on relationship and evolving fiction; players and the MC are given mechanical directive to add and change elements of the world on-the-spot before we even get into the principles thing. When you prepare behind the scenes in a game that a) doesn't require any mechanical preparation from the MC unless you're really into custom moves (which are awesome) and b) has rules that enforce improvisational fiction ... you need to be careful. In vanilla AW, a use of Frenzy or Go Aggro or whatever the Skinner's hypnotic move is can throw a wrench into any specific plot planning you've one with a single roll. So what do we do when we prepare behind the scenes?<br/><br/>Well, we can create maps, create characters and wait for a sensible moment to throw them in (probably with an eye to modify certain elements depending on how we introduce them), create places ... and the big thing is to flesh out details and motivations and names and relationships between characters and organizations and whatnot that cropped up spontaneously during play unless you're good enough at flying by the seat of your pants that you don't need to do that between sessions. <br/><br/>And there's nothing inherently wrong with doing a bunch of that during creation or doing it with player input. As I described, I put a fair bit of history and background and relationships into creation. I just feel, both as a player and as an MC, that it's more interesting when desires and ambitions come together to create relationships and conflicts dynamically. If you want a game in which faction relationships change a lot, you should start with what the factions want and figure out the relationships from there, changing the relationships as necessary to get them to their goals. If you want the faction relationships to be static playgrounds for the players to hop around in, then it would make more sense to say "We want a rival faction here, and a war here," and this there, and so forth and figure out why afterwards. It's not proven truth, or anything, but that's how I see these things both in thought and in play. Let's not forget the most important part of hacking a system: make sure the system fits your game. One of AW's strengths is it's low-prep nature and the way that effects the feel of play and who establishes fiction where and when. There are a lot of tools in AW's box for establishing things quickly in-play. It's less that establishing lots of heavily detailed things beforehand is bad, and more that it's an inefficient use of the tools this system has to offer.<br/><br/>Some groups really like spending a whole session or two just creating stuff, and then sending the GM off to create more. The way AW does things suits my personal fancy better. I love the <i>fictional</i> results of spending all that time building stuff and both approaches I guess feel kind of even to me as a player... but as a GM, especially one who wants to play games with friends who aren't very used to RPGs, I really like games that I can pick up an run with. AW gives me the tools to do that. Keep in mind: you can <i>always</i> prepare more than the rules require you to. You can <i>always</i> sit there and create with your players for multiple sessions before playing. When we're talking about designing a mechanical framework for factions, then, we should be honing in on the lower end of the prep they require. In this case, we're in a system that, before hacking, is <i>almost</i> plug-n-play fast on the first session with old-hand RPG players. With new hands, you're still expecting to spend a good chunk of the first session in-game. If you want to codify faction creation, you should be aware of that and make sure you set the minimum low enough that it's not slowing down the system beyond what you think is necessary for your vision.<br/><br/><i>Of course</i> that's all an artifact of taste. But it's not like anyone (self included) has been saying "I like <i>this</i> and I'm right." No need to throw around words like "truism." I'm pretty sure we're all trying to be nuanced here and we're all interested in the success of this design from the perspective of it's creator. I apologize if that sounds overly defensive and snippy, but it's a peeve of mine when folks bemoan perspectives of false objectivity before anyone's made any claims to objectivity at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420120/#Comment_420120" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-15T12:13:08+00:00" title="August 15, 2013 12:13PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry for the thread necro, but this is a fascinating thread both from a Sci-Fi and AW hack perspective.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/MarkT">@MarkT</a>: Does the link in the OP still point at the most recent version of Star World?<br/><br/>Thanks for the incidental comments on The Sprawl, <a href="/forums/profile/Gwathdring">@Gwathdring</a>.
