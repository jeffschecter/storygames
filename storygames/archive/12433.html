I started a forum game of Apocalypse World (refer to <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12408&amp;page=1#pgbottom" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> to see the initial discussion), and I need a bit of help coming up with scavenging moves for some large city ruins (think the D.C. ruins from Fallout 3).<br/><br/>I just took the name Hatchet City for the main holding (run by an NPC, but the Maestro D' basically holds most of the power), and it's on the outskirts of these ruins. I was thinking it would make for neat explorations and stuff, trying to scavenge valuables and avoid mutants or cannibals or other crazies that hide in there.<br/><br/>I was thinking of making several moves for different things, but mainly I need a good <b>when you scavenge in the Ruin</b> move. Any ideas?<br/><br/>On a slightly unrelated note, we totally have a "metropolis" of about 300-400 people called the Junkyard filled with hyper religious nuts following around a Hocus who made himself the messiah of the "Machine God". That is going to be a shitload of fun and I'm going to come back here with ideas to discuss with you lot, for sure.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279305/#Comment_279305" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-05T00:01:24+00:00" title="July  5, 2010 12:01AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you seen the original <b>scavenge the ruins move</b>?

Most of the 'safe' places have been looted pretty well by now. There's the Fallen Tower, but it glows weird colors at night, and people who scavenge there regularly tend to get kind of weird-sick. There's the Lincoln Tribe's territories, but they're all mutant cannibals, so, y'know, bringing guns and backup might be a good idea if you want to go there. Old Man Jackabacka says he found a decent stash hidden away somewhere, too much for him to carry, but he's always drunk off his ass on that foul weed-wine shit, and wants payment for the location up front. So... what do you do?"<br><br>Then run with it. When figuring out if they find anything after all the difficulties are surmounted, just remember to keep the world real, and make their lives not boring. Or use one of the fine custom moves available, of course.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279328/#Comment_279328" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-05T08:26:14+00:00" title="July  5, 2010  8:26AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2010 8:26AM by J_Walton.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The advanced fuckery chapter also lists John Harper's custom move for scrounging, bottom of page 270.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_279350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279350/#Comment_279350" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-05T15:18:13+00:00" title="July  5, 2010  3:18PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's Ben's scavenging move, that I then modified slightly.
