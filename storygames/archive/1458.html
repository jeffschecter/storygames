                    From Frank Chadwick, in Twilight: 2000:<br/><br/>1. Start with the strongest sensory impression.  The biggest change will be the first thing they notice, so start with that.  The first sensory input sets the stage for all the others.<br/><br/>2. Nothing gets player interest like a hint of danger.  In most cases there will be no immediate threat, but they'll seldom be in a situation where there is absolutely no hint of danger.<br/><br/>3. Save the best (or worst) for last.  Then, when players hear about the threat, they will want more details about it, and they won't have to wait through the other descriptions to ask.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>So, that's *his* advice.<br/><br/>What's yours?                </div>

                            I didn't realize this until just now, but I tend to describe how things sensed make the characters feel, as much or more than how they actually appear to be. "It's painted an uncomfortable shade." "It's a soothing tone that makes you sleepy." And so on.                        </div>

                            I tend to go for broad impressionist strokes with reference to the type and feel of the place.  Sketch the scene in terms of where the characters are and what it feels like.  Specific and relevant details are good.  <br/><br/>I tend to think in fairly "cinematic" terms (used to be in TV production), so I'll mentally kind of do classic hollywood opening shots:  <br/><br/>Establishing shot:  landscape and location, time of day, weather etc.<br/><br/>Cut to Long Shot:  Who's there? what are they doing?<br/><br/>Cut to Midshots / Close ups: details that set the scene, or provide relevant information.<br/><br/>I don't want ( or can't be bothered) to go into huge amounts of details.  I like the players to fill in stuff as they see fit.<br/><br/>If you describe something in general terms, with reference to things the players already know, then you don't need a huge amount of description to get the message across.<br/><br/>Actual Play!  Here's my memory of a recent scene framing.<br/><br/>Ok, so its about 10 in the evening, and you've all in Gerald's company office building.  Its a modern modular office building with the usual desks, computers and a large pot plant sat next to the photocopier, but it's quiet and empty at this time of night. Gerald's office is on the 2nd floor.  You're all stood in the open plan area outside Gerald's office as he paces about between the desks, talking on his mobile.  Suddenly you hear the lift "ding" and as the doors open you see Sadie and a couple of her goons stood there. An eerie blackness hangs about her as she sweeps into the room, dimming the effect of the harsh flourescent lights.  She looks at you calmly and asks "So... which one of you killed Marco?"<br/><br/>So the point is, establish where the characters are, what time it is, and roughly what the surroundings are like.  Everyone in the group has been in a modern office and the sketchy details are enough that we all know what kind of setting this is.  We establish who's there (the characters and two major NPCs) and give a couple of extra details about the key adversary at this point:  Sadie has brought backup and has just performed some powerful bad mojo (hence her aura of darkness)                        </div>

                            At a convention once, I remember talking to a guy who ran lots of RPGA events. No matter what you think of those miserable wastes of time and energy (guess what I think!), the interesting thing he said was that, in having read lots of boxed scene-framing text over the years, something he had noticed is that players almost always tuned out after the first two sentences of description of anything at all, no matter how gripping or important, and no matter where the information that was actually important came in that description. Information that came later almost always was either missed, or wound up having to be repeated. I wish I knew how broadly that applied.                        </div>

                            The Sorenson Rule of Three applies here: pick three descriptors.  Don't use more than that.<br/><br/>A man is short, bald, and sweaty.  The car is creaky, dusty, and loud.  The room is cavernous, plunged in darkness, and disturbingly warm.  That's all you really need.  Going further and you'll get glazed-over eyes as Jeff has mentioned.                        </div>

                            I'm a scriptwriter, and I'm used to give very sparse descriptions of locations, the rule being: Let the set designer / background artist do his job. I think that's a pretty good rule to use in my games as well: Trust the players to provide the full picture, they probably know what things look like from personal experience, movies, or illustrations from the rule book. So one or two sentences for setting the scene is enough. If the players need more information, they'll ask for it.<br/><br/>I give something that needs special attention a sentence of it's own: "There's a large porcelain clock hanging on the wall: TICKTOCKTIKTOCK."<br/>When describing details, I mostly use colors and sounds, and I tend to forget about smell or other senses, unless there's a NPC nearby that can say: "Hey, you smell that?"                        </div>
