This may be slightly ramble-y.<br/><br/>So for the majority of the last year most of my gaming has been Battlestations (great game, by the way) but even as that has been going on I've been acquiring new books.  I have, somewhat inadvertently, become something of an rpg collector, apparently.<br/><br/>Anyway, after returning from Gen Con this year with another new pile of game books, I decided to sit down, look at my shelves, and make a list of all the games that I've never played (or haven't played "enough").  It's a pretty long list.  I want to make this list shorter.  In order to do so, I've decided that starting now I want to play more short term games that last about 1 to 5 sessions, on average.  This will allow me to try more new things.  Unfortunately, even with this system, since I don't think playing an RPG more than once every other week is likely to be feasible, I still won't get to many of the things on my list for a long time.  But that's another issue.<br/><br/>As I've been reading and learning about various "indie" games that I've started to acquire between Gen Con '06 and the present days, I've noticed that many of them are specifically designed for shorter, tighter, more focused games.  Many of them have game ending conditions designed right into them, or even have a specific number of scenes or sessions that a game is supposed to have.<br/>This is cool.  I like this.  It suits my current needs wonderfully.<br/><br/>My point (finally!) is that A) I'm looking for more games which are specifically designed for short term play.  and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> I'm looking for advice for how to set up a short, focused, tight campaign of a game which is not explicitly designed to be played in such a way, because not EVERY game I have on my list is that kind of game.  A few I can think of off the top of my head that I want to play which do not seem to be necessarily designed for very short running games are: Sorcerer (with or without the Dictionary of Mu); Full Light, Full Steam; Perfect; REIGN; and Changeling: The Lost. <br/><br/>So any input on either of those two questions would be appreciated.

You can play it in a single session with three players by really pushing the fights and keeping narration punchy (not necessarily, sparse, though. Play out <i>everything</i>, even the training scenes). A three session game allows you to spread out more, explore the characters and really establish the 'world' you're playing in. You'd probably want four or more players for a longer game.<br/><br/>I really can't recommend Contenders enough. It's super-focused on the world of Boxing, but allows all sorts of outcomes. The boxing mechanics are really tight and easy to grasp, and it's something that anyone, with very little research (watch Raging Bull!), can fall into completely.<br/><br/>EDIT: I think you could play a great, short Over The Edge game. Just have the session be a layover in the airport. They'd get the full Al Amarja flavor, and the end of the adventure would be them jetting away (or being trapped inside the airport forever).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93779/#Comment_93779" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T13:36:31+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  1:36PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I give <i>Polaris</i> <a href="http://greatwolf.blogpeoria.com/category/games/roleplaying-games/actual-play/polaris-actual-play/" rel="nofollow">all kinds of love</a>, but it'll take about six sessions to play through with four protagonists.

Here are my suggestions for tightening up some of the ones meant for longer term play. <br/><br/>I second the two protagonist hack of Polaris suggestion. It worked well for us when we played Anna's Reconquista mod. I've also had very satisfying sessions of single shot Polaris run in the normal fashion, although I've been banned from playing the game due to one.<br/><br/>For a one shot of Primetime Adventures, write up all the characters and their plot arcs, and think about what each session would be about based on the numbers.  Pick the one that the players seem most excited about and play it out. <br/><br/>At GenCon, Joshua Newman ran Dogs in the Vineyard and told us the themes of the town before we wrote up our characters, giving us the opportunity to fit choose characters whose character would be more likely to intersect with the town. It worked well.<br/><br/>For Psi Run, you could start with fewer questions. <br/><br/>For Over the Edge, give the characters kickers and interlocking, contradictory motivations. Then start the scenario with a high threat level.  <br/><br/>Best with it!<br/><br/>--Emily                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93939/#Comment_93939" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T23:39:20+00:00" title="September  7, 2007 11:39PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like a few people have gotten the idea I'm wanting to run one shots.

This has never really worked out well.  I mean, we usually have fun, but we also usually never actually end a game.  We just get tired of it after awhile.  But it's become a bit of a habit for me to think about a lot of games in that way, and I think it's a habit for my players to think of games in that way too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93946/#Comment_93946" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T00:09:35+00:00" title="September  8, 2007 12:09AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2007 12:19AM by noclue.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dogs can definitely work as a one shot.<br/><br/>Edit: or a 5 session run <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93949/#Comment_93949" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T00:13:19+00:00" title="September  8, 2007 12:13AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            5 sessions!<br/><br/>Dude.<br/><br/>Now you speak my language.

Sorcerer is a good example.  I'm still reading through the book, but there doesn't seem to be that much mechanically that really pushes the game to be that kind of short term thing.  Kickers definitely seem to be intended to give the game more focus, which is good... but what can I do as a GM and what should I tell my players to help really push the focused, short game in something like Sorcerer?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>5 sessions!<br/>Now you speak my language. All of my games will do that automatically.<br/></blockquote>\nReally Ben?  I have Polaris and I'm hoping to try it soon (It, the Roach, and The Mountain Witch are currently at the top of my list due the whole "the-longer-i've-had-it-without-playing-the-worse-i-feel-about-not-having-played" thing.  I've had those since Gen Con '06) and I picked up Bliss Stage this year.  Do you think 5 sessions is about average for a game of Polaris?  I was somewhat concerned it might take longer with the standard experience checks and thought maybe when I played I'd need to try the 50/50 experience check suggestion to keep the length of the game down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94022/#Comment_94022" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-08T10:34:12+00:00" title="September  8, 2007 10:34AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Almost all the games on your list will be done in 5 sessions. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>That's a current attraction of indie design.

When other people play, that can go down to four times / session! I say 2-8 sessions but it can be considerably longer if you never do anything bad. I suggest you start things off by killing the senate and declaring martial law. That usually gets people going.<br/><br/>Bliss Stage is different. It actually forces the game to end.

There's nothing mechanically in <i>Sorcerer</i> that can drive the game to end in five sessions.<br/>But there are several things you can do in terms of craft -- for lack of a better term -- to make a more compact game.<br/><br/><br/>First, <b>The Kickers</b>: Remember that the Players write their own Kickers and are driving to resolve them one way or another.  You, as the GM, are responsible for providing the means and NPCs and scenes and decisions that can provide the opportunities to resolve the Kickers.  You need enough sessions to drive things to crazy, back to the wall decisions -- but you have a lot of control about providing those choices.  If the players are committed to closing their Kickers, they'll be driving toward a conclusion when the opportunities arise.<br/><br/><br/>Second, the <b>Relationship Map</b>.  If you've got <i>Sorcerer &amp; Soul</i> you've got the break down of a relationship map as defined and used in a game of <i>Sorcerer</i>.  Now, some maps are really big, but you can make the map tighter.  Remember, the map in <i>Sorcerer</i> isn't a big web of characters with motivations and agendas.  The characters have motivations and agendas, of course.  But the map is their relationship with each other.  Like the towns in <i>Dogs</i>, the relationships for the most part are built on family and romantic relationships that are either legitimate or not.  And like in <i>Dogs</i>, the character come out to the PCs and say, "Hey, I'm looking some help with this..." So the purpose of the relationship map in Sorcerer is to draw the PCs into the web of relationships and have them start making judgments about the behaviors of the characters and decisions about what to do about what they discover about the characters.<br/><br/>A PC begins at one or two points of entry on the map, and start "eating" his way deeper into it.  Of course, other PCs are eating in from different points, and the Players are sitting at the same table, hearing and learning about things at other parts of the map.  Usually people have their own agendas and start pushing their way to make their way toward other NPCs on the map... and so the map gets "consumed" as the mysteries are revealed and the PCs need to make the big and often climactic choices.<br/><br/>So... If there are five characters as opposed to fifteen, you'll run through the map faster. Crisis points between the NPCs will be struck. They'll be forced to make larger and more dramatic decisions, which, in turn, should force the Players to make bigger decisions -- forcing things toward the resolution of their Kickers.<br/><br/><br/>Third, <b>Starting Situations</b>: In <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> Kickers are redefined slightly from the basice rules.  From page 42: <br/><br/><i>"Functionally, they are the same as in the basic rules -- a circumstance that propels the character into making decisions... the Kicker needs to be built very locally.  That is, <b>it applies to a specific adventure, in a specific time and place for the character</b>."</i><br/><br/>That's what I did for the <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> game I just ran at Gateway '07.  I walked in with the prep very situation specific:\n<ul>\n<li>I created two kingdoms -- one civilized, one savage -- on the brink of war</li>\n<li>I created an ancient artifact that members of both sides wanted that could turn the tide of battle, which was rumored to be lost out in the desert wastes where the Old Ones once ruled</li>\n<li>I created internal strife within each kingdom -- some people wanted war, some did not</li>\n<li>I created a romance between the teenage prince of one kingdom and the teenage princess of the other kingdom</li>\n</ul>Boom.<br/><br/>By being very specific every player was very focused on the situation at hand. Because the situation was focused, the players quickly came up with characters and Kickers that would very soon be pushing at each other:\n<ul>\n<li><i>Vann</i> was the half-breed, outcast brother of the barbarian king, obsessed with finding the artifact on his own so he could kill his brother, claim the throne, and lead his people to victory over the civilized kingdom</li>\n<li><i>Althea</i> was a second-tier seer asked by the civilized kingdom's queen to find the artifact and destroy it so both kingdoms would give up their ambitions of war.  He did this because he wanted to rise in power and take the place of the court's seer who had shamed him years ago</li>\n<li><i>Vorenn</i> was a the civilized princess' body guard.  The princess asked her to escort her to the barbarian prince so she and the prince could run off and marry.</li>\n</ul>\nEach of these Kickers would in turn produce reactions from the NPCs on the relationship map, providing Bangs for the PCs.  Moreover, there were only seven characters on the relationship map.  Each Player plugged his or her PC into one of the NPCs on the map right off the bat.<br/><br/>Because of the tight situation, tied to "a specific adventure, in a specific time and place for the character," the structure was more of a Robert E. Howard short story rather than the more sprawling narrative you might get with a looser situation for Kickers. They were all well on their way toward disaster and conflict with NPCs and each other.  (I hope to have a write up of the session up soon.)<br/><br/>And, of course, you can use this kind of focused situation for the basic rules and any setting you create for <i>Sorcerer</i>.<br/><br/><br/>Again, while none of this is mechanical, each of these tweaks on the tools of <i>Sorcerer</i> tightens the focus and drives the Players toward a shorter arc of narrative and lower session counts.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94133/#Comment_94133" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-09T06:34:34+00:00" title="September  9, 2007  6:34AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm... a lot of interesting things to think about.

The one I'm  talking about is type Ron created for <i>Sorcerer</i>, which happens to be the kind that makes the most sense to me.  Up north on his board you'll see the cool relationship map contest that has plenty of examples of relationship maps, all of which carry different kinds of info and uses.  For a variety of reasons, I'm fond of the <i>Sorcerer</i> relationship map.  Ron's break down of the technique in the thread I linked to do a good job of summing up what I find appealing about it.<br/><br/>Also, I'm doing an Actual Play of the game I ran at Gateway, nearby.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94236/#Comment_94236" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-09T15:03:14+00:00" title="September  9, 2007  3:03PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi there,<br/><br/>Let me be more serious about my reply. And more specific. The games you listed as being intended for short term play, pretty much naturally will end within five sessions, the ones you listed as being more long term oriented, you are correct. Those will need tweeking. <br/><br/>It Was a Mutual Decision, My Life with Master, Psi Run and the Shab Al Hiri Roach all have end conditions. You can't play the game long term and still be playing the game. Shock:, The Mountain Witch, and Polaris all have endings too, of different sorts.  Have you gotten to play most of these games? The structure of play is tight. If you use the rules it will force you and your players to get out of grooves you may have been in.
