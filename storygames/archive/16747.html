I've been salivating for the chance to run John Harper's World of Dungeons since snagging it from the Dungeon World Kickstarter.  Tonight, Mom was away, it's Father's Day, and the girls were willing to indulge me.  I spent about 15 minutes mapping out three levels of a wizard's tower, tossed in some monster and treasure ideas, and we were off.<br/><br/>In brief, the game turned out to be a blast.  So much so, that I eventually had to be the one to call it.  Elder Moppet was ready to take a break, but Junior Moppet was ready to hit the next room, despite the initial room's creepiness.  I looked at the clock, and was "whoops, we're past even your summer break bedtime, ladies."<br/><br/>Here's how it went down: We spent most of our time on character generation.  They're not experienced at parsing rules or going through the process of mapping out the minutiae, so we made up stuff as a group.  Junior Moppet wavered between Thief and Ranger before finally deciding on the former.  Elder Moppet wanted to make up her own class right from the get-go, citing interest in Wizard and Ranger, so we naturally settled on Druid.<br/><br/>Junior Moppet ended up with <b>Mist</b>, a dark, tough thief girl who wields twin curved shortswords "like Zuko from Avatar."  She also carries caltrops, a rope and grappling hook, two smoke bombs, special climbing claws, and a handful of darts with sleeping venom.  After adding rations and a pocket-sized candle-lantern, she was operating on a silver deficit, so she asked if she could steal some of her gear.  I said yes, and she rolled a 7 for a burglary effort, meaning she succeeded in pilfering her stuff, but someone in the city is mad at her.  Nice story hook for later.  Mist doesn't wear armor, but has Athletics and Stealth, plus the special abilities of Reflexes and Tinker.<br/><br/>Elder Moppet brought <b>Valavanora</b>, a mysterious, green-clad druid with her peregrine falcon familiar <i>Dera</i>, and two nature spirits she knows how to summon: <i>Mir</i> (domains of water and secrets) and <i>Koriander</i> (fire and birds).  We decided that Druidic spirits had to have an element as one domain, and couldn't embody domains that didn't have some connection with nature.  Valavanora carries a bronze dagger and a short bow, wears light armor, and carries a collapsible pole, chalk, and other druidy ritual stuff (rocks, feathers, crystals).  Her skills are Heal and Lore, special abilities Summon and Pet.<br/><br/>I should say we spent a helluva lot of time on names.  The Story Games Names book got a workout.  They also spent a lot of time trying to decide what their hair and clothes looked like.  Junior Moppet was groaning and generally not the best sport while waiting for her sister to name her entourage.<br/><br/>Finally, we started play.  I put them outside the wizard's tower and its formidable oaken doors.  After determining there were no windows on the ground floor, Mist picked the lock.  With the Tinker ability, she had no chance of failure.  After she rolled a miss, I ruled Mist opened the lock fine, but the tumblers made a sharp noise that surely alerted anything on the other side.   Both girls hesitated and discussed options.  Finally, Mist put on her climbing claws and slipped inside, scrambled up the wall, and shimmied along a ceiling beam so she could get a look at the room.  She has Athletics and rolled a full success, so no problem.<br/><br/>I described a cobwebbed room with two chests, a clay jar, an empty fireplace, and a skeleton sprawled over one of the chests.  The far side of the room had a double door, one half hanging on one hinge.  Small humanoid footprints were visible on the floor, leading in and out of the room by the broken door.  Junior Moppet found all this creepy enough to want to stop playing, but after some reassurance that Mist was a badass, she soldiered on.<br/><br/>She reported to Valavanora, and the two decided to go in.  My move was that the skeleton animated (of course) and attacked them with a rusty sword.  Mist declared she wanted to block the blow and kick a leg out from under the thing.  She rolled a 12, so of course, she booted the leg clean off and toppled the skeleton. Then Valavanora declared she wanted to grab the still thrashing skeleton's sword arm and pull it off.  She rolled a 13, so we decided she pulled off the arm and used it to bat the skull into a corner, where it cracked apart.  Scratch one skeleton.<br/><br/>Then onto the loot.  I just made up stuff on the spot, <i>very</i> generously.  Gotta get them hooked, after all.  I figured they stuck out the chargen process and took out their first monster, so a big shiny carrot was warranted.  By the time they finished their investigation, they had a bag of silver, bronze bracers of protection (+1 armor), a scroll for the Knock ritual, a jar of healing salve, a bag of holding, and a silver coiled serpent ring that granted the wearer the skill of Resist Poison.  Valavanora snagged the bracers, salve, and bag.  Mist took the ring.  They're clear that the silver split is 50/50 and happily marked their experience, though I cautioned them they didn't get XP for the loot until they returned it to town.  I allowed Valavanora to roll Lore to suss out the powers of their bling.  I did warn them they shouldn't expect every encounter to be so profitable.<br/><br/>Both girls are eager to play again.  Elder Moppet wants to get more magic and find a perspicacious loris (we just finished Scott Westerfeld's <i>Leviathan</i> series).  Junior Moppet wants more silver so she can level up and get more skills and abilities.<br/><br/>I am a happy guy.  From a system standpoint, the game runs beautifully.  I asked a lot of questions, made suggestions, and discussed possible consequences before the roll.  Everything seemed grounded and clear; the fictional results were concrete and flowed easily from the mechanics.  I put the die roll results on a folded 3x5 card so they knew what their dice results meant.  Simply put, it's smooth and easy to run, but feels surprisingly granular.  I was really happy to come up with the magic ring granting a new, narrow skill, since I really like the skill system.  When the girls found out the ring's power, both went wide-eyed and oohed and ahhhed.<br/><br/>The kids really enjoyed character generation, from the attribute rolls to the shopping.  Based on the kinds of things she was asking for before play, I expect Junior Moppet will be using her silver to kit herself out like the goddamn Batman.  Elder Moppet commented that she likes this more than Faery's Tale.  During toothbrushing, both girls expressed the wish that they were more like their cool characters.  This summer, we're going to bring together some of Elder Moppet's friends for regular "Dungeon Girls" gaming and anime nights.  We've agreed World of Dungeons is the ideal system to kick things off.<br/><br/>Thanks, John.  Best Father's Day present ever.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382656/#Comment_382656" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-18T04:58:37+00:00" title="June 18, 2012  4:58AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Love it!

It really felt...magical.  I haven't felt anything quite like this since I started with the blue box in the '70's.<br/><br/>Christopher, we played for about two hours, with chargen eating the first hour.  We started with the WoD list, but the girls tried on a few names without settling on anything.  Junior Moppet was going by "Anu" at first, but then changed her mind.  Elder Moppet found the number of choices intimidating, but she enjoyed going through the list.  We went to the Story Games book after nothing in the WoD list stuck.  <br/><br/>It's neat that you played out a prologue of sorts.  I just had Mist roll off-stage, because I wanted to jump right into the dungeon. We haven't gotten to the wider world yet.  I expect we'll build the setting outward from the wizard's tower.<br/><br/>Interestingly, both girls rolled max HP, so they don't have quite *quite* the sense of vulnerability they would with a lower number.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382691/#Comment_382691" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-18T14:30:37+00:00" title="June 18, 2012  2:30PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, given Elder Moppet's interests in mixing magic and nature, I decided Druid was a mix of Wizard and Ranger skills for her to pick among: <i>Summon</i> and <i>Ritual</i> from Wizard, <i>Pet</i> and <i>Wild</i> from Druid.

I'd packed World of Dungeons in case the girls were bored (hah, fat chance).  Elder Moppet told one of the boys about her Druid, and he became terribly interested, asking me repeatedly about the game until his mom shut him down.<br/><br/>This morning, I broke out the rules and the 3x5 cards and helped him make a Necromancer. Three other boys came around and wanted to play.  All were incredulous that a D&amp;D game could be structured around one page of rules.  We ended up with the necromancer, a fighter, and two assassins.  I went to help break down the camp, and the boys proceeded to play by themselves, with Necromancer Lad running the game.  This seemed to go well, and I stuck my nose in from time to time to suggest complications or tips like, "he rolled a 12, make it awesome and take some time to describe what he does," and "invoke the senses--what does it smell like down there?"  They ate it up, immediately getting how important atmosphere could be.<br/><br/>The main mantra I kept repeating was:<i> "The rules inform the fiction, the fiction informs the rules."</i>  For example, I told them, how do your characters see?  <i>A few torches on the walls,</i> they replied.  OK, so the light is dim and shadowy, and you could use a torch to set something on fire, ward off a monster, or burn someone, right?  <i>Ohh, yeahh...!</i> they said.<br/><br/>They played until the parents came to tell them to pack things up. I heard more setting descriptions, more detailed descriptions of what they were doing, and more "atmosphere."  It was clear they were having a helluva lot of fun.<br/><br/>Necromancer Lad told me afterward that WoD was more fun than D&amp;D because there weren't so many rules.  I let him take the printed rules home and tipped all the boys to the existence of Dungeon World and the Kickstarter.  My wife commented that she overheard them talking about +1s and armor and special abilities while they packed up.<br/><br/>The Moppets spent most of the campout in the river or zipping around on skate-scooters, but made a point of telling me they want to play World of Dungeons tonight.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JimD" title="JimD"><img alt="JimD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JimD">JimD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383064/#Comment_383064" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-22T02:17:42+00:00" title="June 22, 2012  2:17AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is tremendously inspiring.

She has special Druidy clothes picked out, a messenger bag that holds the following: a quicksilver dose in a small glass jar, some plastic jewels and coins for loot, a special bag of holding, bandages, some old earrings for talismans, a scroll she made for one of the ritual scrolls they found in the wizard's tower, a feather, and sticks she's going to use for arrows.  There's more, but I've kind of lost track.  I know she's trying to figure out torches and rope.   Her scroll has one side inscribed with arcane glyphs she made up.  She's trying to find something to work for her bracers of protection.  I anticipate she'll ask for a hawk puppet before too long.<br/><br/>My wife was laughing, mouthing "LARP" to me as I stood there, frozen in giddy amazement at this presentation.  Junior Moppet emphasized that she wants to make a Mist costume also.<br/><br/>John, what rough beasts of awesome have we loosed?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
