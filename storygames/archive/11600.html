And I had decided that the tapestry couldn't be destroyed until moonlight had weakened its connection to the demon it housed (demons don't like sunlight or moonlight), and the moonlight would only work when the moon was high in the sky, after 11pm.  I gave the players a riddle plus lots of circumstantial evidence to indicate the moon solution.<br/><br/>So, they found the tapestry and figured out that it was bad news.  They tried to slash it and stab it, to no avail.  I narrated the tapestry wriggling toward the darkest corner of the rooftop.  (I didn't say "Away from the moonlight!" because I didn't want to make the riddle too easy.)  They read the riddle.<br/><br/>"All good!" I thought.  I wasn't even going to worry about the "11pm" thing. This seemed a good moment to shine moonlight on the tapestry and chop it up and end the adventure.<br/><br/><i>And then they decided to bolt the fuck away from the curse effect which was sapping their strength, and from the skirmishing townsfolk nearby.</i><br/><br/>Uh oh.  I turned to my "steps of doom" for the scenario, and saw the last two: "air become nearly unbreathable" and "demon escapes from tapestry".  Well, we didn't have enough time left in the session to fight a demon.  I described the tapestry bucking and thrashing around, but the PCs simply tied it up and continued with their plan to take it elsewhere.<br/><br/>Even if I ditched the emerging demon, this still seemed bad.  They'd get to safety and then figure out what to do via leisurely experimentation -- major anticlimax.  We were already in a nice, dramatic scene -- I wanted to make them do it <i>now</i>!<br/><br/>So, I just sped up the asphyxiation and made it clear that they'd never make it over the fence and away from the curse before they passed out.  That seemed to do the trick.  They latched onto the riddle, figured "something about the moon!"  They theorized, "Try moonlight?"  I backed this up: "When it wriggled on the roof, it <i>was</i> moving away from moonlight!"<br/><br/>So they threw it in a patch of moonlight!  I narrated the magical transformation into a normal tapestry.  "Yay!" I thought.  "Now they'll hack it up and we're done!"<br/><br/>Nope.  "Is the curse gone?" they asked.  "Nope," I said, still figuring they'd destroy the thing to be on the safe side.<br/><br/><i>They didn't destroy it.</i>  They just worried about asphyxiating and what else they might have missed.  One player latched onto a piece of the riddle, "past eleven".  She theorized, "Maybe at 11pm, the curse will break!"<br/><br/>"Okay," I thought.  Now I knew what to do.  Build a little drama as 11 approaches.  I narrated a panther monster approaching.  I said that it was somewhere around 11 now; if not yet, then any minute!<br/><br/>Fortunately, no one checked my math.  Their original plan for "after dark" in late spring, plus the amount of time they'd spent since arriving, would probably have left the hour around 9.<br/><br/>I was content to give the panther one or two swipes to cause injuries before I declared it 11.  But one player came up with a clever way to keep it at bay, so I ruled that swipe had been lost.  Then I narrated the dramatic end of the curse.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258610/#Comment_258610" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T22:41:35+00:00" title="February 25, 2010 10:41PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think if you were going to dramatically speed up how fast the curse was getting bad, you damn well had to speed things up to get us to 11 PM.<br/><br/>But consider how much meta-game thinking of the sort that you're officially not supposed to do in Delve you were engaging in: Oh gee, I don't want them to do the safe thing, I want to make it more dramatic.

This involves either:<br/>a) prepping more thoroughly than I do -- for instance, I hadn't determined whether the curse travels with the tapestry or not, or<br/>b) ad-libbing "outs" when the players hit a "bad puzzle moment"<br/><br/>A "bad puzzle moment" is when you have no idea what to do or how to get more info.  This results in:<br/>1) doing nothing<br/>2) methodically trying everything with no rhyme or reason<br/><br/>Personally, I find anticipating every contingency that's likely to arise in a scenario to be no fun.  So I make puzzles that I <i>hope</i> are good, but I'm willing to ad-lib a bit in case they're about to cause a "bad puzzle moment".  In my experience, even expertly-designed puzzles can cause "bad puzzle moments" because it's hard to read each other's minds.  My buddy Al stays in physics engine GM mode and the players run out of ideas and then play just winds up sucking (unless there's other stuff to do besides this puzzle -- but in Vatndale, there really wasn't).<br/><br/>As for pushing drama, it was a tough call.  I'm more likely to do that when showing the game to people for the first time.  For my home game, I would almost never* do that, because they all know going in that if the villagers all die because they took too long to remove the curse, well, it's just a bump in the road for their adventuring career.<br/><br/>*the exception would be if we're running out of time and someone really has to go home                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258614/#Comment_258614" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T23:07:34+00:00" title="February 25, 2010 11:07PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not sure if I answered your question.<br/><br/>If I had given you all the hints and outs I could, and you all had still chosen actions that wouldn't plausibly have worked (given my knowledge of the situation), then you would have failed in the mission.

Clue me in?<br/><br/>Knowing nothing, I just have to say that when I do a puzzle in your random average D&amp;D game, it's either completely optional (just some extra reward, say, and not necessarily obviously present, even), solvable with sufficient expenditure of resources (say, spend time getting hints via lore checks until you figure it out) or its outcome is fun even if it's never solved (a trap that goes off if you don't solve it, say). This way there is no danger of getting stuck in the morassy bog of puzzle-solving failure. That demon situation seems to me like it'd go solidly into category three: why couldn't the demon just get free and go on a rampage, aside from concerns over playtime?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258629/#Comment_258629" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T01:07:15+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  1:07AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's the classic GM mistake of beig afraid of letting the players get the solution too easily. Like, in the movies the characters always come up with the solution in the nick of time when it's dramatically appropriate but since this game isn't about the characters but the players coming up with the solution it's hard to control. I think you simply should have said "it shuttles away from the moonlight" and one player probably would have been like "it's evading the moonlight because it's afraid of it!" and everyone would instantly have formed a plan on how to get it lit and everyone would have been happy with their brilliant plan. Don't make players work for clues, work is no fun, puzzling the clues together is. What is the tapestry vulnerable to is a poor puzzle, how do we get it lit is a good puzzle that could involve mirrors and wrestling and smashing of windows and walls.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258630/#Comment_258630" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T01:34:10+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  1:34AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the tapestry idea, and its weakness to moonlight.<br/>\nI see the tapestry as portal the Demon forcing his way through but held back by the moonlight.<br/>\nThis image for me would have been great.

There's nothing wrong with that, except, perhaps, that it's a particularly step-by-step railroad: to break the curse, they need to shine moonlight on the tapestry <i>at a particular time</i>, then cut it into pieces. It's difficult to figure all that out. And, of course, you had to <i>massively</i> railroad the players to get them through that sequence: stopping them from escaping, telling them about the moonlight.<br><br>So...would you like tips on how to railroad the players better? Or tips on how to run the thing in a less railroady way?<br/><br/>Interestingly, it's worth nothing that the players offered you a couple of good endings. Fleeing with the tapestry was a fine ending: let them take it to a museum, then see what happens there. Fleeing is generally a good ending: you could just let them run away from the entire horror, letting them be responsible for the re-emergence of the curse. So, what I'm asking is: would you like to accept the players' endings? Or would you like tips on steering the players' actions towards the ones you had in mind?<br/><br/>Graham                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258722/#Comment_258722" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-26T09:56:21+00:00" title="February 26, 2010  9:56AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>Is "did I rig the ending?", in the subject header, a question you want us to take shots at answering, or one you feel you've answered in your post?

The basic theme is mostly paraphrased in <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/2007/11/01/challenge-based-adventuring/" rel="nofollow">this</a> post from a couple of years back. If I had to characterize the thrust of my writing in hindsight, I'd say that a half of it is (hopefully constructive) complaining about the clumsy bits of the D&amp;D rules and setting, while the other half is about how I've learned to run gamist, fiction-heavy fantasy adventure: setting first, explicit challenge, heavy scene framing, clarity in player-to-player communication and so on. It's sort of like a hippie take on old school renaissance, approaching the particulars of system and setting with heavy skepticism while essentially glorifying the parts I like about old-school D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Speaking of dead ends in puzzle-solving, my current solution on the matter is to have the GM be rather relaxed about his role in the puzzle-solving interaction. By this I mean that he shouldn't be a tense and carefully non-committal robot; it's much more fun if he can taunt the players and put pressure on them like a quizz show host. Don't let the momentum disappear and make sure that chairmanship of the party is firmly in hand, in your own hands if necessary. (If I'm going to write a fantasy adventure rpg text at some point, it'll include a specific party leader character - the job of that player at the table is then to make sure that the party decisionmaking procedures run fluidly. I've found that it's very good if I can complain to a specific player if the characters are not doing anything interesting, and then expect him to direct the conversation to conclusions and out of the analysis paralysis.) The key point is this: you have to know when the party is not going to solve the puzzle - and however you find it out, knowing it, you can give them more hints or frame forward to the consequences of failure. I mentioned a pretty generic and fiction-respecting technique upthread: offer the players more hints in exchange for fictional resources. The simplest way of doing this is to offer them a lore ability check (and a potential hint) in exchange for the characters sitting around for a few hours wracking their brains. Of course this isn't interesting if there's no time pressure, but then you have to always be clear on where the challenge lies: if nothing is preventing the characters from sitting around until they get a hint, then you should already give that hint to them and narrate the time-skip, no need to make the players ask for it. And if it should prove that you've already given them everything and they still don't get it, just pressure them to quit: "Seems like you're not getting it, shall we move on?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259044/#Comment_259044" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-27T23:46:31+00:00" title="February 27, 2010 11:46PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2010 12:25AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, easy: just create a setting that's full of satisfying adventures.

The key to avoiding visible contrivance with "dead end here" is to avoid red herrings, really.  If players don't find stuff to pique their interest, they'll turn around before too long.

I agree, for exactly the reasons you listed.  I'm really scared of costing anyone decision power, though.  If a pushy player grabs hold of an in-fiction role that enables his character to command the other characters, then the other players get short shrift.  The in-fiction role would need to be carefully defined -- no extra pay or honors, a mere time-tested best practice, etc.  (Maybe you can even get voted out?  Not sure if that's feasible, though, in a game where constant PC cooperation is vital.)<br/><br/>"Quiz show host" is an interesting analogy.  I like it.  "What are you going to do about <i>this</i>?"  Actually, huh, I do a <i>ton</i> of that.  Mostly I do it to remind players of opportunities they've forgotten, or to prod them with problems that shouldn't wait too long.  Is that what you do?  And what about "taunting" them?  If you'd care to provide an example, I'd love to read one!<br/><br/>Cutting to "it's too late! now look what happens!" once you're <i>sure</i> they won't solve anything sounds good, especially if the coming badness is foreshadowed.  I usually wind up waiting out the in-fiction clock, though, because, even when I'm out of hints, it's hard for me to sense when they might have some inspiration that'll give them a chance.  I do indeed say, "Seems like you're stuck on this, let's move on to something else," for specific tasks, but I wouldn't say that and then jump immediately to "The town explodes!  You lose!"<br/><br/>As for waiting on hints, I couldn't agree more.  That's just grindingly awful.  Keep things moving in the real world, and skip ahead in the fiction if you have to!  (Note: when I figure giving a hint will improve play, I never roll dice, because a bad roll would just interfere.  I only consult character abilities when determining <i>who</i> to give the hint to.)  This is one of the bet things about the pacing dial.  If the characters are searching a room, the instant they lose interest in my colorful description of the room, they crank the dial up to "summary" and say, "What did we find?"  Man, some Call of Cthulhu games really need that.<br/><br/>I'll check out your links.  "Hippie take on old school renaissance" sounds superficially similar to Delve, but I imagine real challenge plays a much bigger role for you.  (Delve is, like, challenging in ways, at times, but it's not a Challenge game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259456/#Comment_259456" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T20:14:42+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  8:14PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Dave?

Because, to someone thinking that way, "A more advanced group just died in there," is rather a flag of "interesting dramatic opportunity". I mean, if this was a book or a movie, you KNOW the characters just have to go there.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm not sure I could always separate one from the other. Like, if I'm playing Delve, I know I don't have script immunity or whatever (although I may suspect I have some, due to the large scope of GM fiat present in the system, and everyone's desire to Keep Playing), but I still might unconsciously gravitate towards such dramatic potential. In a blank slate situation, it might be easier to control that impulse, but if, say, my character's thematic ties are involved somehow: <br/><br/>* The character has just succeeded in some unlikely challenge, and is developing a reputation as a daredevil.<br/>* Something interesting is at stake. Say my character has lost his/her child, and this puzzle/secret/mystery involves someone else who has lost their child.<br/>etc.<br/><br/>In such situations, I can see myself leaping towards dramatic opportunity, without even realizing I'm doing it. It would probably just feel like "what the character would do" in play--that is, in terms of player experience.<br/><br/>I think early D&amp;D accomplishes this kind of thing largely because of the low detail involved in the definition of Character, and no Situation (or almost). Delve might be rich enough in fictional layering to bump up against some challenges of this sort, though.<br/><br/>And I wonder if I'm the only one in that respect.

It's not uncommon at all for a group to have different expectations about the diegetic framework (oh my, didn't expect to get to use that word in a valid context) in which their fiction resides: it is equally reasonable for a roleplaying game to exist towards the teleological goal of creating stories as it is for it to exist for causal purposes of exploring the consequences of actions. Both types of roleplaying games are out there, and many games are drifted to both directions from an ambivalent starting point. Considering this, it's not far-fetched at all that a player or an entire group would march their characters to a certain doom, trusting that the GM will conspire to ensure that the result is an exciting story instead of a short and unceremonious death.<br/><br/>Do note that "the place is dangerous and you'll likely be killed" is mere setting flavour for a good adventure fiction protagonist. He'll grit his teeth and do what he has to do for king, God and country regardless of any danger to his person. It would be severely out of character for a player to shirk from that sort of challenge if he thought that the point of the game is to take up the GM's story hook and see where it leads. Conan doesn't get killed for going to a dangerous place, so why would his character?<br/><br/>This is a pretty big thing in traditional roleplaying, this difference in fundamental models. The striving for unity in '80s game texts made it so that the mark of a good GM came to be that you'd be able to fulfill both goals at once, somehow; the rules system would take care of the routine causality, while you as the GM would cheat your way into a satisfying story whenever the causality would fail to produce such. In this more enlightened age we luckily have more vocabulary and design cases to compare and contrast, so we can see clearly how different games can be. Thus it's a simple matter to recognize whether you're running on causality or teleological narrative imperative in your GMing, which you can then tell the players. It's very fine for the high and mighty GM to drop hints via NPCs about impending death, but this is not the sort of quality communication I expect of players nowadays; if you want to say something to the players, then say something to them instead of dressing your message in in-fiction flavour. It'll serve communication much better if you'll just tell the players that this game's going to be realistic and you're not going to save their characters from a frustrating death if they insist of taking on an overwhelming challenge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259693/#Comment_259693" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-02T13:32:58+00:00" title="March  2, 2010  1:32PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/>I get what you're saying.  I think I've covered it, though, in the intro "why play this game" text/spiel.  My reply to Paul was based on the assumption that direct player-to-player conversation about such topics had happened previously.  From there it's just a matter of finding an elegant way to rekindle such awareness at a specific moment of play.  Stopping the game and going, "You guys realize I'm not going to fudge this to save your lives, right?" is also acceptable, but tiptoes on the edge of handing out too much info ("Your characters don't know if this is actually a death trap, but I'm telling you it is.") and breaking character-POV.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259696/#Comment_259696" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-02T13:43:37+00:00" title="March  2, 2010  1:43PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2010 1:45PM by David_Berg.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe,<br/>"Whatever you do turns out to be what was needed!" flat breaks the game if the players ever notice that pattern.  For the immersive mindset, it's just as bad as the dick GM who says, "Whatever you do turns out <i>not</i> to work!"  What I did in the Curse of Vatndale session was also bad on this front -- I just happened to pull it off because I'm good at hiding contrivance.  That's the ultimate point here: <i>NO VISIBLE CONTRIVANCE.</i> <br/><br/>I think what we're getting at with this thread are some techniques to avoid contrivance altogether (no need to hide it if you're not doing it) and simultaneously facilitate drama (judicious scene cuts, epic failures with lots of fireworks, etc.).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259799/#Comment_259799" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-03T00:24:55+00:00" title="March  3, 2010 12:24AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 3, 2010 12:39AM by nikodemus.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Stopping the game and going, "You guys realize I'm not going to fudge this to save your lives, right?" is also acceptable, but tiptoes on the edge of handing out too much info</blockquote>\nI've been contemplating having a "death" token/sign/mini, and putting it on the table without comment when character death is a real risk in my mind.<br/><br/>"Death is on the table."<br/><br/>The problem is that sooner or later -- preferably sooner -- <i>someone has to die</i> if that token is to mean anything.<br/><br/>This is on my mind this morning as I just read Jeff Tidball's musings on the subject: <a href="http://gameplaywright.net/?p=1223" rel="nofollow">http://gameplaywright.net/?p=1223</a><br/><br/>EDIT:\n<blockquote>NO VISIBLE CONTRIVANCE</blockquote>\nThis is related. Contrivance becomes more visible over time, and one way to "proove" no contrivance is to allow the characters to fail.<br/><br/>Scare quotes because you certainly can fake it by forcing the characters to fail -- which is the biggest problem I have with contriving things unless expected level of contrivance is in the social contract in the first place. If I contrive characters to succeed where failure should have happened, any failure that happens is due to me failing to contrive their success. Sooner or later failure stops being failure and success stops being success.<br/><br/>...but yeah, not all contrivances are created equal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
