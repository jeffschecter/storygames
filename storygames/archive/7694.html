This is Dain's wife, using his log-on to comment.  A little background:  I've been playing RPGs for about thirty years now.  For the last twenty or so I have regularly (every couple of weeks or so) had dreams in which I am one of my characters or dreams which could belong to one of my characters.  For the last year or so, I have had <i>recurring</i> dreams about two of my characters (ie; the same dream repeated).  Dain and I are playing a Universalis game based on dreams I had about a character from a more traditional RPG that had gone belly-up with our regular gaming group.  The GM of a now defunct Amber game added plot elements after I mentioned dreaming in character.  The GM of a Champions game added a new power to my character after I mentioned this to him (Dreamwalking, a sort of astral-travel using other peoples dreams as your 'highway').<br/><br/>To sum up: over the last twenty years, I have <i>regularly</i> dreamed about eight different characters from seven different games.  Characters storylines and powers have changed because of my dreams.<br/><br/>I am a hard-core, full immersion gamer (before becoming involved in the indie game movement, Dain described me as a Method gamer).<br/><br/>Oh yes, the <i>creepy</i> aspect... Dain very occasionally dreams about his characters as well... on one memorable occasion, my dreams and his dreams about characters from the same game <i>dovetailed</i> into a coherent plot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170969/#Comment_170969" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T11:51:17+00:00" title="September 24, 2008 11:51AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2008 6:59AM by NickWedig.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a very short lived game I GMed, a PC had a dream in which he was at work at his job as an auto-mechanic.  He couldn't figure out the problems with the car - the symptoms didn't make any sense.  When he went to look for some paperwork in the glove compartment, he found a mass of blood and feathers.  He thought that was weird, but in dreamlike fashion carried on with his work.  When he went to look under the hood, the hood slammed down, the car animated itself and slammed him into the wall over and over again, until he died in the dream.<br/><br/>Then, of course, he woke up.  And went to work, where a customer brought in a car of the same make and model as in the dream.  And they, too, had a list of odd symptoms of what was wrong with the car.  When he looked under the hood, there was a mass of blood and feathers.  Which totally freaked the player out.  The mechanic PC returned the car to the owner and refused to work on it, or offer any explanations.  Since it was a horror game, I thought I had done my part.<br/><br/>EDIT: In the waking world of the PC, a bird has hidden inside the car's engine to keep warm overnight, and gotten mangled whent he owner turned it on.  Nothing weird going on there at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sacredchao" title="sacredchao"><img alt="sacredchao" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sacredchao">sacredchao</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171083/#Comment_171083" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-24T19:46:24+00:00" title="September 24, 2008  7:46PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite><br/>Oh yes, the<i>creepy</i>aspect...

They didn't know who this woman was, though they had seen similar spiral markings in a tomb. Those who accepted her gift held out their hands and she let a drop of light fall into their cupped palms. The water made ripples like the spirals, which sank into their skins. The group talked about the dream but lied in various ways about their choices. Now they are left wondering what accepting the gift actually meant ... if it meant anything, and who took it. I think this worked better than the same scene might have done if it were not badged as a 'dream', because no one is sure if it meant anything at all, even though they know it happened OOC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171197/#Comment_171197" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T08:50:19+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  8:50AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Might be a good time to mention the very cool<br/><br/><a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=54314&amp;motds_id=2503&amp;from_home=0&amp;filters=0_0_0&amp;free=1" rel="nofollow">Dreamwalker Revised</a><br/><br/>And it's free.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/olepeder" title="olepeder"><img alt="olepeder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/olepeder">olepeder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172984/#Comment_172984" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T14:44:21+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  2:44PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For some reason, it's very rare that I dream about the roleplaying situation. A few years ago, when I was paying more attention to my dreams, I'd relatively frequently have these LARP-inspired dreams, where I sort of knew I was in a LARP, but it was still all real, or something. Very meta. Recently, I seem to recall a couple of dreams taking place in the RPG setting I co-authored, which was almost a relief, seeing as the whole setting is explicitly surreal/dream-based.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173334/#Comment_173334" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-05T11:38:16+00:00" title="October  5, 2008 11:38AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had some issues in the past with games of the "each scene must have a conflict" sort.
