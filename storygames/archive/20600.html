So we did - <a href="https://writingames.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Writing with Games</a> is basically a postal rpg session between the two of us, playing <i>S/lay w/ Me</i>. At this writing the story is progressing just like you'd expect of S/lay, except it's in a readable format available for others to enjoy as well.<br/><br/>The choice of game was dictated in part by our shared fondness for the literary genre of pulp fantasy and in part by the fact that S/lay fulfills the constraints of the medium well: as a two-player game it's not dependent on a large number of people, as a turn-based game it fits well in the format and it produces rather literature-like stories. We've played for a few weeks now, and so far this has been quite enjoyable - we're certainly doing a much more acceptable amount of creative writing per week this way than the usual lonesome toil of the writing hobbyist achieves.<br/><br/>As a side experiment we also asked a friend, Peitsa Veteli, to illustrate the play as it proceeds. As S/lay does not directly incorporate a court illustrator, the role is somewhat informal, but we'll have to see - perhaps some sort of structural logic is achieved over time.<br/><br/>If you enjoy reading fiction, do take a look and perhaps post a bit of critique on our English literary style, por favor - improving our writing skills is a big aspect of the project for us, so any insightful observations on what we're doing are very welcome. I don't think that it's supremely useful to compare the produce of our play directly to finished literature, but I think this process does a good job of bringing out our skills in dynamic, immediate writing - whatever our individual technical weaknesses as writers are, they sure make an appearance when the deadlines are tight and the gameplay constrains the ability to plan and polish. I've compared the experience of writing this to participating in a marathon while juggling with beer bottles.<br/><br/>Also, as a more general consideration of the topic, a question I've been pondering around this experiment: what other games might work well for blog-based, literarily oriented play? <i>De Profundis</i> is an obvious suggestion, but what else might be considered, were one to play more along these lines? This is a sort of a specialty niche in the niche of story gaming, and one that doesn't obviously map to any other analytical traits we usually use to characterize games. Some games just seem more likely to produce a readable story than others, and even then it's not a given that the game can be altogether restructured into a postal format where the players communicate in slow, large chunks of information instead of a quick back-and-forth.<br/><br/>I'll make note of <a href="https://anonkun.com/" rel="nofollow">a different type of interactive postal play</a> here myself, simply because I find the "quest" format that's developed among the Internet denizens over the recent years interesting in itself. It's not a direct inspiration for what we're doing, but the creative impetus is quite similar, I think. (I'll also note that I do not particularly recommend the afore-linked site to a writing hobbyist due to its suspect copyright contract; I'm merely linking to it as a convenient explanation of the phenomenon.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452119/#Comment_452119" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-11T05:07:06+00:00" title="April 11, 2016  5:07AM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, Eero!

I hadn't really planned making a project of it, but I've ended up playing enough of S/lay with different people over the last few years to feel that I've got a bit of a handle on its nuances. Still haven't finished a full campaign, despite the compelling and definite campaign arc of the game - it is a truly ambitious vision in some ways <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>(For an example of what I consider a "nuance", <a href="https://writingames.wordpress.com/2016/04/11/night-of-the-tall-tales/" rel="nofollow">my last turn</a> in our on-going game illustrates how the GM-player can compensate the loss if they are obligated to pass on a dicing opportunity during the Match. I just wrote a little bit of an explanation of it as a comment to the post itself, as I've tried to commentate the proceedings a bit to make it easier to follow for new-comers to the game.)\n<blockquote>I've run and/or participated in a few of these on the S-G forum.

I'm personally especially interested in any observations about the types of games that can be used for this sort of thing. I'm less enthusiastic about pure freeform, as you might imagine. S/lay is in many ways just perfect in the way it focuses play while allowing the players great freedom in developing the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452176/#Comment_452176" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-12T21:24:10+00:00" title="April 12, 2016  9:24PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2016 9:25PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I always enjoy your analyses of various games, so I'd love to hear a little about the basic structure of Slay/w/me and what makes it unique.

All three games seemed well-suited to this purpose, although none of them were designed with that in mind:<br/><br/>1. <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/8445/showdown-playtesting-with-paul-t/" rel="nofollow">Seth Ben-Ezra's "Showdown"</a><br/><br/>I enjoyed this one a lot, even though it took us a long time to finish. Quite an interesting game, since it combines collaborative storytelling with a heavily competitive vibe between the two players (you are opponents in the game as well as at the table).<br/><br/>2. <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19960/as-the-worm-turns-live-open-playtest-formerly-backseat-adventures" rel="nofollow">"As the Worm Turns"</a><br/><br/>The resulting story in its own thread (unfinished, but much easier to read than the link above): <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19965/as-the-worm-turns-live-open-playtest-resulting-story" rel="nofollow">Resulting story</a><br/><br/>This is a barebones game I designed for playing with children in the backseat of a car. We had some trouble steering together into the same genre in the forum version, but there were still some interesting moments. In live play, however, the game was lots of fun, and the Oracle works extremely well.<br/><br/>3. <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20534/perseverant-help-me-playtest" rel="nofollow">Ben Dutter's "Perseverant"</a><br/><br/>This one went pretty well, although it is also unfinished.

What are its creative challenges, and what techniques does it train?</blockquote>\nLet's see... The most uncommon thing about S/lay for me is the way it relates the player to the character: the task of the "you" player in creative terms is the usual one for a narrativist game in that they are an advocate for the character's interests, but the tools are very abstract, honed into something GM-like. Specifically, what the player possesses is no more or less than the narrating authority you usually see a GM hold: the power to frame, the power to introduce, the power to elaborate and the power to resolve. The back-and-forth between the players is predicated on the exchange of the "narrative beat" rather than character pressure, necessarily; the "you" player, who is supposed to represent the hero-character of the story, may just as well end up the active as the reactive participant in introducing and resolving plot points. So while it <i>may</i> be "OK, you open the door and there are orcs, what do you do?" it may just as well be "OK, I open the door and there are orcs. What do the orcs do?"<br/><br/>The technical basics are very similar to your basic conch-passing game such as <i>Once Upon a Time</i>: first I tell, then you tell, and we take turns until the story ends. However, the way the game focuses and constrains the narration with the dice and the player goals is really clever - not that surprising, as Ron absolutely knows about the perils in conch-passing, he's the one who phrased the terminology surrounding the topic. So the game manages to superficially fulfill the simplicity of "I tell, you tell", but without ever getting into authorial disputes or zilch-play.<br/><br/>The key to how the game manages this is familiar from <i>Polaris</i> - the players have well-defined roles in terms of <i>goals</i> rather than <i>authorities</i> as would be more usual. Both players have identical, symmetrical authorities, but their goals, roles in telling the story are heavily asymmetrical: the "you" player is advocating for the hero (I know you know about my thinking regarding this, what "playing the character" constitutes of theoretically speaking) while the "I" player is driving a hard Climax (by running the hero ragged in story terms, basically, while encouraging him to over-commit in the setting) and trying to make the hero fall in love with the Lover. Because the player goals are ultimately expressed in terms of communicating with the other player, the game becomes a real roleplaying game in Forgite theory terms: a shared imagined space exists, and the players are forced to manipulate it to achieve their aims. It's not like Once Upon a Time, in which winning may constitute of of pro forma relations between cards and the words that come from your mouth; in S/lay the only way for the hero's existence to have meaning is for the other player to believe in him, and the only way for the Lover to get what she wants is by convincing the other player of her sincerity. It all happens in the fiction, it's a very fiction-oriented game.<br/><br/>The conch-passing structure of play takes some getting used to, to begin with - it takes a while for the participants to realize that it's like being the GM in an ordinary game, except you just take turns doing it. Once you get the "narrative beat" down it's easy - you just push forward-moving events in turn and the story flies forward, and it's generally easy because your every turn is guided by your complementary, specific player role goals: the hero is struggling for his Goal (the mechanical concept, I mean, not the player goals I mentioned just now), the GM-player is being Monstery or being Lovery or both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452267/#Comment_452267" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-18T21:33:24+00:00" title="April 18, 2016  9:33PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Eero.

In practice a Hero who wants to survive the story has to pick either the Goal or self-preservation (or both if they have the picks).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452883/#Comment_452883" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-03T14:53:42+00:00" title="May  3, 2016  2:53PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting!
