(If you like games like Final Fantasy Tactics, the gameplay is in that vein, though perhaps a bit simpler.)<br/><br/>Of possible interest to the SG crowd:<br/><br/>* Delivering content at a webcomic pace and style.<br/><br/>* Bite-size, casual-friendly gameplay with a few tasteful social game features.<br/><br/>* Integration story with gameplay, and (soon) integrating audience feedback into both. (I believe users will soon get to vote on what new equipment / powerups are available to the party.)<br/><br/>* Built in pure HTML5/CSS3/JS/BBQ.<br/><br/>There's a leaderboard and everything to show off how you do in the battle, but you'll see that my results ("locke61dv") are shamefully poor.
