But man, we had a wierd, surprising (at least to me!) breakthrough last night.  It came from a whole assemblage of separate threads coming together in a really odd way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThread #1:  Version N-1 had required lots of six-sided dice.  Each person needed 12d6, and those 12d6 had to be in their own distinct color (so if Sydney has all blue dice then nobody else can have blue dice ... Eric needs to have all red dice, etc.)  That's the sort of prop-requirement that's <i>easy</i> for a practiced roleplayer to live up to, but awfully hard for a non-gamer.  I'd started getting <i>really</i> concerned about that.  If I want this to be a game accessible to non-gamers, I really have to put my money where my mouth is, and do the extra mental effort to get the same game experience out of more commonly available tools.<br/>\n<br/>\nThread #2:  In a version N-2 (I think), Eric made this <i>awesomely simple</i> discovery.  I may have posted about this already, I forget.  But we had a pool of dice in the center of the table whose role was "You can give these dice to other people" and we had a pool next to each person whose role was "These are the dice you can spend for yourself."  We <i>kept getting them wrong</i>.  Like, two out of three times.  We'd reach down to the pool right in front of us and toss a die to another person, and then a moment later say "Oh, <i>shit</i>, that's the wrong pool."  Well Eric had the bright idea to simply say "The dice are in the wrong place.  Let's put the pool from which you pull dice toward yourself <i>far away from us</i>, so that we reach out and pull.  And let's put the pool from which we toss dice to other people <i>close to us</i>, so that we grab a die and push it away."  It totally fixed our mis-steps, <i>instantly</i>.  We took to the new pool-placement like a vampire bat to warm blood.  I was startled at how big a difference that little change made in smoothness of play, and so I decided to focus very strongly on tweaking those issues of intuitive prop-use.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe result of these two threads coming together is Version N (which we played last night).  Version N doesn't use dice ... it uses cards.  A deck of cards, after all, comes <i>pre-packaged</i> with four distinct suits, so if you've got four or fewer players (as we did) then all you need is the one deck.  Everyone got their own suit, and the randomizing shifted from "roll the dice" to "draw from your deck."<br/>\n<br/>\nEric's previous insight served me in good stead:  The cards that are powering <i>your</i> powers are in a deck that you draw from (draw your own advantage <i>toward</i> you) while the cards that you empower other people with are in a hand that you play from (push advantage <i>away</i> from you to other people).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book-keeping of rising tension and story-arcs is dealt with very simply:  If you play a face-card for your own advantage then after the conflict it's played in it is removed from the game.  That worked out exactly as I expected ... people hoarded their face-cards, moving toward rising action, then played them in an escalating flurry, and then ran low in the denouement.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we did with the system:  We played some Shadowrun, essentially.  Sydney played "Starr," a celebrity leading a double-life of (a) being a tween pop idol and (b) being a borderline psychotic cyber-elf killing machine.  Jennifer played Lily Shadow, former celebrity, current magic-addict and agent to Starr.  Eric played Thodin Lugwrench, their dwarf biker-gang roadie.  They had snuck away from their watchful parent company (they thought!) to meet with Malcolm, an up-and-coming (and, by player request, <i>very Scottish</i>) exec from a rival corporation about switching labels.  There was some good personal conflict in the team, then some tension and negotiation when Malcolm showed up, then an all out fire-fight when their parent company tracked them down and sent a wet-ops extraction team to "rescue" Starr.  It was simple, and bloody, and horrible and <i>awesome</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nSydney decided that Starr wanted to treat Thodin as her pet/security-blanket, but the dwarf wanted to hit on Malcolm's sexy japanese kunoichi body-guard, so he blew Starr off (oooh ... rivalry on many levels!)  Jennifer decided that Lily's hold over Starr was that Starr was addicted to the thrill of <i>combat</i>, and Lily was the only one who would routinely let her put herself in danger (and dispose of the bodies afterwards).  Sydney decided that Starr was Lily's dealer for illegal and addictive magic.  Oh, they were so wonderfully dysfunctional.<br/>\n<br/>\nI particularly adored the moment when I said "I'm declaring a conflict ... if I win, Malcolm gets himself killed in the cross-fire of your combat, and it's <i>all your fault</i>!" and everybody was like "Y'know, we're actually okay with that."  Jennifer reluctantly concluded, however, that while she didn't give a damn about Malcolm as a person, she cared about him in his role as The Money.  But man ... <i>cold, heartless nastiness,</i> I tell you what!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway ... very, very good session, as I've come to expect from anything I put in front of these people.  What I <i>did not expect</i> was how much reducing the handling time ramped up people's energy levels.  I mean ... Version N-1 was a pretty damn light system, but there was still something about it that acted as a constant drag, keeping people from going into total feedback loops of building excitement.  Version N has clearly crossed some threshold somehow, and we had a sudden <b>EXPLOSION</b> of energy at the table.  I'm still trying to analyze ... I feel like Reed Richards, after some huge burst of cosmic radiation blankets the earth.  "Fascinating!  These particles are totally unlike what came before!"<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat the players said in post-game talk was that the mechanics felt, at every point, like doing the intuitive thing was going to be doing the right thing ... and as a result of that, they weren't thinking about the mechanics at all, but rather about the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I'll accept this.  No problem.  But I was watching the game as its designer, and I can say with <i>absolute certainty</i> that I saw people being hugely manipulated by the rules.  They played in a style very unlike what they do in other systems.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo they're saying that they weren't even thinking about the mechanics.  And I'm certain that the mechanics were guiding them.  And that's the insight I'd like to push out into the spotlight here ... a system can do a <i>better</i> job of directing people if it can convince them that it's not doing anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love the show <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098833/" rel="nofollow">Jeeves and Wooster</a>, and I think I see a lot of the same dynamic going on here.  At each turn, the mechanics were <i>present</i> without being <i>intrusive</i>.  Just sitting there, gently in the background.  And whenever a player thought to themselves "Hrm ... I wonder what I should do next?" they had a hand of cards in front of them saying "Well, sir, if you <i>were</i> to express an opinion about someone..." or stacks of cards in front of them saying "Madam, I would certainly never imply that you should engage in a conflict, but if that were your desire you would be well equipped," or a huge deck saying "It is not a servant's place to tell his master when to draw cards, of course..."<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rules have become so gracious that they can <i>pretend</i> that they're doing nothing but the unvarnished will of the players, while simultaneously guiding them very strongly.  What a terrific holy grail to strive for!  Does that happen <i>any time</i> that you bring the handling time down low enough, or (as I suspect) is there something <i>else</i> that also needs to happen before the game is intuitive enough to discreetly fade out of people's awareness this way?  And if so ... what is that thing, and how can I get more?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74201/#Comment_74201" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-07T08:23:56+00:00" title="June  7, 2007  8:23AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>And whenever a player thought to themselves "Hrm ...

I think that's a good sign, but you can certainly take it for what it's worth.

Sub-systems tend to make me a little googly eyed when it comes to really knowing a system in and out. The more like a board game things get, the more I think you'll find it accepted like you've described. What I am trying to say is this: if you're traveling around a board and you know (and have down pat) that you always need to roll 2d6 when you get started and then refer to the result to make your next action/decision, then you can automate that part of the game. If the rules have an 'always do this first' method (with little to no exceptions), then you may be on to ritualizing that and encoding the rest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74262/#Comment_74262" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-07T13:14:15+00:00" title="June  7, 2007  1:14PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me see if I can codify (though this won't ... and isn't intended to ... bring you up to speed on how the rules all work, just what the points of interaction are):<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you narrate in an ability for color (like, you've got "Cynical" and you behave cynically in a non-conflict context) you can draw cards from your DECK.  If you like the first card then you put it down on the place in your character sheet (in our case, pieces of paper with our abilities written in big letters, and nothing more) for that ability.  Otherwise you have to put it into your HAND and keep drawing.  If you have five cards in your HAND then you can't put any more in there, and must put the next card you draw onto the ability.  (Summary:  Draw a card, look at it and either place it face-down or put it in your hand and start again)  This is one of the places I'm looking at simplifying further.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you express an opinion about someone else ("Wow, she's one scary bitch, isn't she?") you may choose a card from your HAND and put it on <i>their</i> character sheet (and they'll write in an opinion-reminder to help them remember what it's for).  (Summary:  "<i>Och</i>, that wee dwarf must have the heart of a lion!" followed by handing over a card)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you get engaged in a conflict, you put forward stacks from off your abilities and the opinions on your character.  That determines who wins (and, independently, who narrates the victory), and then you return <i>other people's</i> cards (i.e. the opinions they gave you) into their DECKS, discard <i>your</i> face cards forever, and take your other cards back into your HAND.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, those are all the ways you can interact with the system.  I suspect I'll end up adding <i>one more</i>, but I have ideas about how to make sure that it doesn't break the flow.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that answer your questions?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74266/#Comment_74266" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-07T13:27:18+00:00" title="June  7, 2007  1:27PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So you have an algorithm, then.
