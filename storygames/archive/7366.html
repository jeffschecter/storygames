We are presently dealing with city bureaucrats in our plan to open a B&amp;M retail store that blends our copy and print services together with games (with a major small press focus). Once we have everything on display and warehoused in our retail space, we plan to launch GOB Distribution. Our distribution business will be representing the majority of titles that we POD print for our clients together with Guild of Blades products and a select number of other small and mid sized publishers. Our focus, initially, will be on independent RPGs and Card Games and much, much less so on miniature gaming and board games (since GOB and a couple other small press companies we already intend to represent have the board game genre fairly well represented already).<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom small press/indie publishers we are most interested in seeing who we can work with on a POD printed capacity. Both for a program to shelf and sell the products in our store and to rep those same products through GOB Distribution. On both of those programs we bare the printing cost and will print as necessary to shelf/distribute the product and the publishers are paid as product is sold. Almost think of us as a One Bookshelf or other PDF retail site, but for printed titles printed via POD.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe will also be considering non POD printed products for distribution from publishers willing to give us wholesale terms (though as a distributor we will never be asking for "payment terms", preferring to pay as we order). We will be, however, much more selective of the non POD printed line we chose to represent, especially at the beginning. With all such ventures, you "have to start somewhere" and we'll be chosing those lines that best compliment our own and the POD products we'll be distributing, helping to round out our overall offering to retailers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe timeline for the launch of GOB Distribution is approximately 1 month after we open the doors on our retail store. That _was_ planned for late September, but with red tape and all that, its likely going to be a little while after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

Seems I yammered on to long for one post....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for GOB Distribution. I expect that enterprise to start small. Guild of Blades left distribution with its own products back in 2004. We have sold direct to retailers since that time, but as a single manufacturer, its has been a challenge to find retailers willing to order direct. Most simply don't like the time vs rewards efforts of ordering from single manufacturers. So as a consequence we do business with only about 20 stores direct currently. GOB Distribution will, however, greatly expand what we will be able to offer retailers. We'll be taking our 80-100 titles and combining 500-1000 more initially, attempting to provide strong stock and service on some great small press lines that we feel underperform in th market in large part due to the poor fill rates for said products through existing distributors. We will be striving to give retailers a place to order those products and be nearly guaranteed of getting a 100% fill on their orders. Additionally, our POD wholesale program will allow us to introduce the average POD title to retailers at a 48% discount, a strong discount that retailers are familiar and comfortable with while at the same time be able to deliver a stronger bottom line profit for the manufacturers we are distributing for. Being both the POD printer and the distributor knocks out several rounds of shipping (which is a considerable cost savings at todays fuel prices) expenses, letting us bring POD products to retailers at industry standard discounts. We can also operate the "distribution" service at essentially break even cost structures since GOB Retail itself directly profits from the POD printing, so in spite of being a "small" distributor, we'll be a fiscally healthy one. That plus the ability to guarantee availability should provide a number of solid reasons for retailers to want to do business with GOB Distribution. That all being said, its going to start slow and grow slowly as we add manufacturers that we represent and as we go through the motions of communicating our offering to a broader set of the overall retail base.<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually we intend to expand the IT infrastructure we've built to run this all so we can create dynamic direct marketing opportunities for our publishers. For instance, you could have the ability to create a number of fliers, catalogs, small posters or other promotional materials then be able to specify under what conditions said promotional material gets printed and included with retailer shipments. For instance, you could have a PDF catalog in our system and a note that the very first time a retailer orders one of your products, have it printed and included with that order. But any time an existing retailer of your line orders something, don't have it printed and included. We could track "last sale" for an item you make to a retailer and have the system "automatically" print a flier that served as a re-order remainder for your line if that retailer hadn't ordered anything new after X amount of time, but once sent, it would be recorded that it was sent and the next time after that you might opt not to send it again or you might opt to include a promotional "additional" discount or something to entice them to restock your product/product line. Build this system will let GOB Retail make a bit of extra money printing that marketing material for you, but more importantly, if a robust enough system is created to empower publishers to send various materials for an assortment of conditions, we'll hopefully bring introducing a higher level of target and intelligent marketing to the industry. Helping to bridge the massive communication gap that currently exists between retailers and manufacturers presently in the industry. I am a firm believer that in order for both manufacturers and retailers to better capitalize on the products we all sell, an open communication line needs to be opened between retailers and manufacturers. Information needs to be shared. Sales figures for individual manufacturers and product lines at specific retail locations need to be filtered back uphill to the manufacturer and a channel of communication for retailer feedback to those same manufacturers created. Most of that information is currently lost in the void of current middle man distributors within the industry and they all jealously guard any potential sharing of said information, fearing the forging of direct relationships between retailers and manufacturers. Frankly, most retailers are not best serviced ordering direct from individual manufacturers anyway. So distributors should look to facciliate greater levels of communication and make themselves indispensible in that role. Everyone will be better off for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, one brick at a time, as they say...<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

I was thinking of discussing all sorts of publishing stuff with you if I bumped on you, but no such luck. Well, maybe another time. For what it's worth, I'm very happy with the quality-to-cost ratio on the Zombie Cinema cards (printed by Ryan), and I've recommended your services to some friends already; while there is some color variation and cutting deviation in individual cards, I couldn't recommend any printer nearly as affordable if you want real cards with sorting and packaging. The service was also confidence-preserving, with prompt and direct responses to all concerns; this is important when you have a deadline and two dozen balls in the air all at once.<br/><br/>As for your forum of choice, I'd think that this is more than suitable as a Publishing topic at the Forge. But of course, pick your own forum of preference; just let us know where you're revealing all the good stuff so we can head over there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_163993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/163993/#Comment_163993" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T07:39:08+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  7:39AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Ryan,<br/>I don't see where you said the location of this enterprise.

Retail Group is the near burbs and the Publishing Group out in Davision, about an hour out. Right now, assuming we can work things out with the city and the land owners, we'll be opening up the first shop is a detroit suburb called Clawson. I couple years from now, with luck, the second store would open 6-7 miles away in either Warren, Sterling Heights or Troy. Maybe Southfield.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe general idea is going to be to polulate a metro area with these smaller footprint stores, then eventually make a much larger store (4,000 to 7,000 square feet) that is coupled with a sizable warehouse faccility that will be converted into membership based game club. The club will serve as the central hub with the smaller stores serving as the spokes.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce open, anyone is welcome to drop by. If we sell your stuff we can turn it into an combo author signing and GM with the creator event. We'll also be hosting all day publishing seminars a few times per year, but the first one won't be for several months after we open. I'll always be looking for guest speekers for said events.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

The simple version, Aldo has limited storage space (he sublets from Chessex and then publishers sublet from him) so piles of books not moving (much) ties up his allocation of space in the warehouse. Many trad publishers are moving to POD now (I did it a long time ago and I think GoB did so even before us) and that makes for a better situation but you usually need to still have 300-500 in the pipe at initial release in order to fill distro demand. Times that by 40-50 publishers and at any one time you can have a pretty formidable surge. Have one that just has piles sitting there and you need to fight through that.<br/><br/>And that is the simple version...;)<br/><br/>Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HinterWelt" title="HinterWelt"><img alt="HinterWelt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HinterWelt">HinterWelt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164283/#Comment_164283" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T19:19:07+00:00" title="August 21, 2008  7:19PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2008 11:22PM by HinterWelt.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin Bow</cite>Alliance Distributors also was looking into acting as a fulfillment house for small press publishers a few months back and would be worth looking into.</blockquote>\nI could never get ahold of them.

It works out well due to the volume. Roma True20 is going POD but I had the roughest time finding a POD printer to handle the fold out maps.
