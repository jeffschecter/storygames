In GSS PCs have connections to and from each other and NPCs, and at the start of each scene your connections grant you points of Wonder and Feelings. You spend Wonder to use special powers and Feelings for attribute checks. (And during play everyone gives Dreams, kind of like PTA Fan Mail, to reward good roleplaying, which you then use between scenes to improve connections.)<br/><br/>The thing I've found is that this resource-based approach creates a really different dynamic, which works well in GSS because it's a heartwarming game about magical animals helping people with everyday problems. The game has rules for opposed checks (basically a bidding war with Feelings), but I've never once used them in play. Instead as the GM I'll say things like, "You need an Animal result of 6 to climb that tree," and the player will sometimes choose to fail in order to adorably fall down or something.<br/><br/>To me the big issue with resource-based mechanics is that they change the basic dynamic from "Do you think you'll be lucky enough to succeed?" to "How much do you want to spend to succeed?" or "How much do you think you need to spend to succeed?" When players are using resources on things where they want to succeed, they'll naturally spend them according to how much they prioritize success, and usually hoard them otherwise. In GSS the overarching goal is more to build friendships and such, so success and failure at any given action are a step removed from that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389533/#Comment_389533" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-07T09:56:32+00:00" title="September  7, 2012  9:56AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) When you have a bunch of different people taking turns contributing stuff, like in Fiasco or Microscope or Montsegur 1244, surprises are inevitable<br/><br/>2) In Fiasco, there are well-defined rules for who decides whether a scene goes 'positively' or 'negatively' for the current player.

When I run the game I specifically try to set up situations where I <i>can't</i> predict how the PCs will react, and seeing what they do is part of my fun as the GM.<br/><br/>For 2), there's pretty clear rules on what it takes to accomplish any given action, if your relevant attribute isn't high enough, you need to spend miracle points to do it. Once you're familiar with the system it's almost effortless to play. That said, you can occasionally have a hammer-nail type problem: "Well, I've got Domain 4 (fire), so I'm going to solve all my problems by creating Fire!" Also, some players are <i>really</i> reluctant to spend miracle points, because "what if I need them later?" and end up short-changing their character's potential, and other players burn through them almost instantly and end up feeling sad and underpowered until they earn a refresh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thornlord" title="thornlord"><img alt="thornlord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thornlord">thornlord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389540/#Comment_389540" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-07T10:21:05+00:00" title="September  7, 2012 10:21AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the most part these games are "resource-management" as <a href="/forums/profile/Onix">@Onix</a> stated above me. You may have attributes of a specific value and then a pool of points to distribute for an increase. You then compare your attribute + points allocated (0+). <br/><br/>In Nobilis which is the diceless game that I know best if you're performing a "miracle" (action) you state the level of the miracle. If the level is greater than the character's attribute level you add in miracle points to make up the difference. If the value is greater than the opponents attribute+miracle points then your action succeeds to which you and the GM negotiate how it affected the narrative.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389542/#Comment_389542" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-07T10:25:22+00:00" title="September  7, 2012 10:25AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is nothing more surprising than six people making stuff up together.

Sometimes (like in Amber), your fixed stats pretty much tell you who's going to win any given confrontation, but you are encouraged and allowed to create fictional circumstances that give you an advantage over someone with a higher stat, with the GM as the gatekeeper of whether it's "enough" or not. <br/><br/>In Polaris, each player has a role with authority over certain things (the Heart controls their character, the Mistaken controls Demons), and then the ritual phrases are more fine-grained "switches" for authority over the final outcome (making bargains, essentially).<br/><br/>For me, the <i>specificity</i> of who has authority over what, and under which circumstances, is pretty important for fortune-less play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389544/#Comment_389544" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-07T10:55:18+00:00" title="September  7, 2012 10:55AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really need to try Nobilis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389548/#Comment_389548" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-07T11:05:17+00:00" title="September  7, 2012 11:05AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/ndp">@ndp</a>: I've played a semi-successful session of Polaris, but didn't really get it.

You need to jigger some way to get out of trouble using those.  And you have things you cannot do.  When the storyteller needs to threaten you, they will push you towards those things.  You will have to chose between failure, harm, or "doing that which you cannot do."

The rules system identifies some situations as uncertain, defines a range of possible solutions and the fall of the dice provides a chose one of those solutions to the game.<br/><br/>But in reality any situation in uncertain in games. Noting is certain. If we wanted any situation to end with carrots, it can. The game has no certainty in it own, only the certainty we as players want to give it. What dice really does is to when we think it applies, present a limited range of conclusion to a limited set of situations. The dice might dicided what happens if you decide to attack someone, but every moment of the game is uncertain, since you could have chosen to do something else during any moment of the game. <br/><br/>So most uncertain situations in any games are always handled without a dice. You just decide what happens.<br/><br/>Sometimce a dice based rule system helps define what it possible. Or it seems that way. Deciding and coming up with a range of possible and interesting solutions to situations is always a player skill, not something that comes from the dice. The system or the dice can suggest a solution in an abstract way, but incorporating that abstract thing into the game is always something that the players do. Dice are mute, they give you numerical result. Not story. The story comes from interpreting the numbers.<br/><br/>So what you do with dice to do is often is to represent that a situation is uncertain and create an emotion in the player (not the character) of that the situation in uncertain, and without their control. And without any one else control. You can archive the same sort of emotion, by creating a game environment where everyone can put something into the story, but no one is in complete control of it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389572/#Comment_389572" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-07T14:14:24+00:00" title="September  7, 2012  2:14PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2012 2:20PM by Arpie.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're talking about unpleasant uncertainties, players are human beings and we do have a kind of darkness inside.

You kind of have to think of it as an economy, a story you "buy" successes with one bit at a time.<br/><br/>Do you WANT to make something happen in the story? Spend a resource (or undergo a minor character change.)<br/>Universalis does this, too, but the other systems here are more advanced and a bit more focused on the emotional impact of changes (which give a lot of depth to the story.) <br/><br/>If you want to up the excitement, you can do an Amber-style bidding war for task resolution, but I've found that games where you simply "buy" a better outcome have plenty of opportunities for set back, disaster and reversals.<br/><br/>(I'm looking forward to Golden Sky Stories when I get some money together.

Scene framing and scene tone are influenced by the music playing at the time, though only insomuch as the players choose to keen their ears and listen.<br/><br/>The game isn't about determining whether the characters succeed, but instead about whether the characters change their minds (about their future). The point of conflict is internal and self-driven.<br/><br/>Surprises and unexpected twists occur all the time - partially triggered by the music playing, partially because games always do this.

You're a bunch of kids wandering the neighborhood and discover your photography teacher dead and an impossible machine and strange photographs in his basement. And GO! The game starts you there and just follows where you go. Plus, there's a lot of implicit structure and themes in the descriptive text you read out-loud to the group before play begins. That helps built the vibe and create a shared sense of what the game's about, one of which is weird adolescent tensions.  There are also rules for narrative control of certain elements that keep things strange and interesting and prevent you from ever feeling like you know what's going on.<br/><br/>In <b>Metrofinal</b>, the world is ending and everything is growing more and more surreal as the distinctions between things breaks down. You are a powerful agent of fate, but you are constrained by the structure of the board, turn-taking rules, and the fact that other players often determine the results of your actions. Plus, only certain characters are able to cause things to progress at certain locations, which is a roadblock and forces characters to do things they may not normally have considered.<br/><br/>Honestly, most of the more successful diceless and GM-less games I know do that thing you're talking about by creating reasons for the players to not be on the same page about something, and then empowering them to explore those differences through play. These can be different objectives, different interpretations of the same thing, different characters, etc. Juxtapose incongruities!<br/><br/>P.S. The best games with dice do the same thing. Dice don't create problems by themselves, they do it through how they are interpretted into the fiction by players.

What happens is this: after you write a chapter of what your character is up to, you offer 5 Chapter Titles for the next player, who must select one, and who then must write his chapter using the Chapter Title concept wrapped into his chapter some way.<br/><br/>There is also an additional reward system for players who balance their chapters between having good and bad outcomes for their characters, since there is no ability to have "refereeing by the other players" to keep a player from just writing his character to get what he wants all the time. So, the system allows that to happen, if the player wishes, but is not rewarded for doing so.<br/><br/><a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpg/12896/epistolary" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://rpggeek.com/rpg/12896/epistolary</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389600/#Comment_389600" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-07T22:26:55+00:00" title="September  7, 2012 10:26PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No love for Amber Diceless?

Alternately, if the players take more antagonistic or less collaborative roles (say, in Murderous Ghosts), then the system doesn't have to step in to play that role as much.<br/><br/>It's a conversation, right? And the rules are there to mediate the conversation. So what you need the rules to do depends on what things the players are handling on their own and what things the mechanics have to step in and facilitate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/harleqwn" title="harleqwn"><img alt="harleqwn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/harleqwn">harleqwn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389647/#Comment_389647" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-08T18:49:58+00:00" title="September  8, 2012  6:49PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding Amber, I've found that it tends to operate in a very traditional capacity with the GM on one side and the Players on the other.

And without any one else s control. You can achieve the same sort of emotion, by creating a game environment where everyone can put something into the story, but no one is in complete control of it.</b><br/><br/>The group I'm in hate the idea of no dice. W176 quote hits the problem on the head. <b>We need to feel the uncertainty of a situation. </b><br/>Dice Provide that illusion and for my group there is no other.:-(<br/><br/>1) The injection of surprising things<br/>I think this  has been covered above, <b>On "surprise": You're all correct that multiple players inherently brings the surprise. I realize this was totally the wrong question.</b> <br/>But I don't think it is a wrong question, its a dam good question! creating surprising outcomes is natural for some and more heads might help but also good story's, settings, characters and situations help. Some games use random tables, oracles but I think the biggest problem is breaking the flow of a game to introduce a surprise or breaking the emotional feeling of the player. If we discuss the surprise as a group it no longer becomes a surprise because we all know about it. This is like problem w176 was talking about above. I have no solutions but if this is a correct observation a solution will come.<br/> <br/>2) Adjudicating uncertain situations<br/>Positional systems help here just like a decimal point to show a numbers power. <br/>Tecnoir<a href="http://technoirrpg.com/" rel="nofollow">technoirrpg.com/</a> uses a term called <b>Vectors</b> An excellent term we can all use to describe a bad statement.<br/>Here's an example of a god Vector from the rule book <b>Shoot attacks require a clear path in a straight line\u2014called line-ofsight to- the target.</b> <br/>Could some adjudicated uncertain situations just be bad vectors ? <br/>Tec noir also uses a system of increasing pressure, applied by Adjectives, (bloodied, trapped.) These adjectives can be sticky or fixed. These two tools from Tecnoir help in Adjudicating what a player can do.<br/><br/>What I haven't found are clear tools for<b> Adjudicating uncertain situations</b> Tecnoir does a great job but it does use dice!<br/>But if you could get a clear adjudicating system, would you need uncertainty? <br/>I think you do but does this help to point at what uncertainty really is. Going back to what w176 said. <br/>Its not a Adjudicated situation, but an uncertain situation beyond anyone's control. <br/>So is it a Percentile system 30-50-80% chance of it happening? or is this just back to adjudicating but its fuzzy moving and gives results which vary. The fuzzy results are determined by a percentile roll you interpret zero being bad 100% being good.<br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/> <br/> <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389724/#Comment_389724" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-09T21:48:57+00:00" title="September  9, 2012  9:48PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2012 9:49PM by zircher.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Regarding Amber, I've found that it tends to operate in a very traditional capacity with the GM on one side and the Players on the other.

Which is pretty OSR I guess, but I've always been of the opinion that if you're constantly looking for ways to circumvent the rules, maybe you should use a ruleset you actually like using instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390788/#Comment_390788" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-19T09:06:51+00:00" title="September 19, 2012  9:06AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 19, 2012 9:08AM by Arpie.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that, "You have to talk the GM into it" thing doesn't really give players that much power.

That game have realized that the other players can create as much randomness as dice.<br/><br/>There is a karma resolution based system about intriguing vampires that have been started to spread at Swedish conventions. A game that I'm really fond of nowadays. It's called <b>Svart av kval, vit av l\xf6gn</b> (Black of Despair, White of Lie). The only bad thing is that the game just exist by word of mouth. The players are playing one vampire each (it's kinda GM less) and they all got one goal each that want to fulfill during the game. During a scene, any player may give a <i>beast command</i> to another player. The Beast in a vampire is always trying to show the violent side of the vampire or try to humiliate the human side. The commands can be "Tear that person apart", "Run through the wall", "Show your physical strength", "Take him as yours", "Crawl in the dust", "Be her slave", "Betray your brother" etc. The player who doesn't obey the beast takes a token. You may have as many tokens are you like. If the player have a token and obeys the beast, a token is removed.<br/><br/>Anyway, when you do something to someone else, the list of who succeeds is as follows:<br/><br/>The Beast<br/>Vampire hunters or human mobs<br/>Elderly vampire<br/>Younger vampire<br/>Human<br/>The Beast rejected<br/><br/>So a younger vampire will always loose against an older vampire. You may always release The Beast to win the challenge, but you have to overcome the problem in a violent way. That's the only way you may win over older vampires and vampire hunters. If you got a token while releasing the beast, any player - including yourself - may take the token, which means that the beast don't want to help you. <br/><br/>In the end, this nifty system creates a pattern where younger vampires must follow a much bloodier path to get what they want ... and they if they want to follow it, it's a question of what they will do to reach their goal.<br/><br/>I really never seen the point with karma resolution, but I adore this system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidVS" title="DavidVS"><img alt="DavidVS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/nMT00GFQS5U2U.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidVS">DavidVS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390851/#Comment_390851" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-19T23:20:24+00:00" title="September 19, 2012 11:20PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>To my knowledge there are three ways diceless games handle challenges.<br/><br/>1.

A simple voting system is used (the "push") to decide differences or deadlocks that might arise in a scene.<br/><br/>Last week I got a chance to take part in a playtest of the second edition of <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13780.phtml" rel="nofollow">Sufficiently Advanced</a>, which will be diceless. This iteration used parallel systems--one character based with a karma based system of professions and skills, and a drama economy tied to themes you want to explore with the character. To overcome a foe or situation with a high difficulty, one can do so by spending points if a salient theme can be invoked. Further points can be purchased by accepting plot twists and complications. Be interesting to see if this is the final direction for Collin's development of the game. <br/><br/>And, Jason: word. <br/><a href="http://www.customink.com/designs/minyan/vgu0-000r-pnp3/twt" rel="nofollow">A gaming minyan</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391311/#Comment_391311" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-25T09:56:19+00:00" title="September 25, 2012  9:56AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unfortunately, my point is that, if you have to use a die <i>at any point </i>to resolve some situation and move the game forward, can it truly be called diceless?<br/><br/>I'd argue for microscope, because that show of hands thing is not randomly-generated, but I would argue against, say, Pilgrims of the Flying Temple, because drawing cubes out of a bag is a form of randomized conflict resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money" title="Big_J_Money"><img alt="Big_J_Money" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">Big_J_Money</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391357/#Comment_391357" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-25T17:09:21+00:00" title="September 25, 2012  5:09PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All this discussion about diceless has inspired me to create an example of a diceless combat contest mechanic for a sandbox dungeon-crawl.<br/>The purpose would be to invoke more dread than bad dice rolls can.<br/><br/>Example, PC versus monster combat: Compare stats chosen for the contest and secretly bid points from their Deadly pools.  Secretly choose whether attacking or defending,  then reveal both secrets.  Higher attacker scores a wound. Maybe include rules for bonus points from environment use, equipment or combat skills.<br/><br/>Players can discern whether a monster's stat is higher or lower, but not the exact value until after the creature's first attack. Even then, they still don't know the size of the monster's Deadly Pool until they've encountered it enough times to learn.  But it should match the perceived dangerous appearance of the beast and/or the perceived danger of the area it's discovered in. The GM shouldn't be a dick and have the same monster in two different encounters possess different stats or Deadly Pools (maybe a small random variance is fine -- or variance is a stat itself.  Some monsters are known to vary wildly from creature to creature. Astute Monster Scholars can learn which ones and maybe know the tell-tale signs that give away its physiological capabilities).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_391367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walterman" title="walterman"><img alt="walterman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walterman">walterman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391367/#Comment_391367" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-25T18:53:17+00:00" title="September 25, 2012  6:53PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Solipsist has no dice.
