For me, it is easiest to handle such things with the language in one hand while working on the calligraphy alongside.<br/>\n<br/>\nMain Questions:<br/>\n1. General impressions? Too oriental?<br/>\n2.

You'd either need multiple brushes for one character or you'd need extraordinary muscle control, in which case I'd expect the characters to be more detailed and less chaotic.<br><br>yrs--<br>--Ben                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121494/#Comment_121494" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-23T10:42:19+00:00" title="January 23, 2008 10:42AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2008 10:44AM by Andy.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pointing to Johnathan's post above: Think about the tools that the ancients in this culture had access to.  <br><br>In a fantasy game set in a world without a lot of hard wood, I figured that split reeds were the primary communication device, and thus basically recreated a written language of angled Vs, triangles and dots; where it looked like they could have conceivably originally been made with reeds.

Kiran writing originally used their claws in a soft clay later heated for preservation. Down the road they used their claw, often purposely frayed slightly, on paper with ink. This would have been a natural evolution from the wet soft clay which would have coated their claws after "writing" and allowed them to write on other substances temporarily. <br/><br/>The race is predominately left handed so their writing is top to bottom, right to left.<br/><br/>For reference, they look like:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://neb.hinterwelt.com/images/kiran/kiran.jpg"/><br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HinterWelt" title="HinterWelt"><img alt="HinterWelt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HinterWelt">HinterWelt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121503/#Comment_121503" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-23T11:11:37+00:00" title="January 23, 2008 11:11AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Pointing to Johnathan's post above: Think about the tools that the ancients in this culture had access to.<br/><br/>In a fantasy game set in a world without a lot of hard wood, I figured that split reeds were the primary communication device, and thus basically recreated a written language of angled Vs, triangles and dots; where it looked like they could have conceivably originally been made with reeds.

I try to take elements of human culture or beliefs and incoporate them into the races in Nebuleon. It has worked well so far. <br/><br/>Since they are predominantly left handed it is top to bottom, right to left. The Kiros-kjet or Long Word which is represented here are ideograms. I am considering a tonal alphabet as a lesser or foreign alphabet. In this case, a very important concept for them, prefix and postfix contractions showing possession and proper naming would need to be represented. For instance, K'Telk is the porper name for the star system discovered by Telk.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1of3" title="1of3"><img alt="1of3" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1of3">1of3</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121525/#Comment_121525" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-23T12:40:45+00:00" title="January 23, 2008 12:40PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2008 12:43PM by 1of3.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure what a "tonal alphabet" is.

So, current tech uses claw sensitive pads or if writing on paper or clay they might use a stylus in the shape of a claw with a spongy tip to approximate the use of several different claws on the hand as well as differently shaped claws.

It would be easier using claws as they would vary in weight allowing differing weight lines to be applied, especially in clay.

The Dras leap to mind as a life form that lives in the O2 band on gas planets. It floats by filling hydrogen bladders and communicates by a form of advanced body language. I have no idea if they will even have a written language. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>In terms of cultural motivators for the language, the Kiran are all about action. For this reason I have decided to go with the V-O-S organization of the sentence structure. Also, the idea of ideograms, ideas as characters, seems to be a very good way of communicating a lot in very little time. <br/><br/>I also plan on using diacritic marks for just the purpose you outline.

In fact, I have taken a lot of what has been said and will be using it. That said, saying "Claw Writing definitively does or does not work x way" really is not helpful. That sounds a lot harsher and seems to imply an anger that is not there. Ben may be a highly trained calligrapher and linguist, I have no idea who he is, but I will not take his or anyone else's opinions carte blanche and apply them to an aspect of my game or setting. <br/><br/>That said, I welcome any and all opinions, information and ideas. I often come across as fait accompli because I think of a lot of this some years ago when I designing the setting. Then, when I explain my reasoning, in typical internet haze, it sounds like I am rejecting all ideas counter to my reasoning. Andy has had some great points. I hope to incorporate his ideas and some of the others posters ideas.<br/><br/>Does that make my position clearer? Again, in typical internet fashion, it makes me sound wishy washy about the whole thing. I just want people who, I assume, are unaware of the Nebuleon setting to understand where I am coming from.<br/><br/>Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121601/#Comment_121601" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-23T17:43:29+00:00" title="January 23, 2008  5:43PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy pointed out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform_script" rel="nofollow">cuneiform</a>, which might be a fruitful direction to explore, as it was (among other things) written in clay.

Therefore, if an alien script has variable line width, we have to assume that, first, they're super good at pattern recognition and, second, that they have such astonishing fine muscle control that it's not only easy to do variable line width with a single implement, but that it is not detectably easier for them to write with consistent line width instead. So that says something really interesting about the species. If this species doesn't have those capacities, I would imagine that their writing would look different.<br/><br/>Secondarily, the top three drawings (the non-number characters) seem very "scribbly." Look, for instance at "Kiro." There's a tiny white dot in the middle of the character. So, seeing this as a primal character form, I have to assume that that tiny white dot is integral to the meaning of the character: if it wasn't there, the character would either mean something else or perhaps mean nothing at all. Why do I make this assumption? Because, over time, scripts tend to evolve to the simplest possible forms, leaving off anything un-needed for the meaning. There's a lot of things in those characters which make me go "Is that angle/dot/swirl meaning-bearing? Really?"<br/><br/>Most of my problems are with the top three. The number characters are really nice. I get the sense that these are scratched into clay or dirt, using a number of different fingers at the same time. The fifth one is a little bit awkward-looking, though, but that's because my assumption is that it would be written with five fingers at once. Is that true?

Going to try this in line but we will see how it works out.<br/><br/>Actually, they are great at pattern recognition, far superior than humans. It is a function of their sight and the construction of their brain. This helps make them the best at soldiering in known space.<br/><br/>That said, I am a crappy calligrapher. <br/><br/>That that said, I think I may be misunderstanding your issue with the thickness of the line. Do you mean character to character or within a character?  If the former, see the "that said" comment above. If the later, that is calculated from the angle of the claw to the paper/clay and the ability of the calligrapher. In a computer read out or standardized font, you would most likely see single weight lines since it would be easiest to represent. I should also mention, it is not a defining feature of the character. The shape would be much more important than the thickness of the line. That is to say, you would not make a different character just by making a thinner line.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite><br/>Secondarily, the top three drawings (the non-number characters) seem very "scribbly."

Being developed for right handed people it is full of lines that go from bottom-left to top-right (like the forward slash character "/"). It was a hell for me as a lefthanded to learn and write it.<br/><br/>--EDIT--<br/>Here is a (horrid) webpage with some samples of a textbook for that writing system<br/><a href="http://web.tiscalinet.it/giochidiluce/stenografia.htm" rel="nofollow">Stenography with the Cima System</a><br/>--EDIT--<br/><br/>Looking at your "number" characters: I like the looks, but they are awkward for me to write.<br/><br/>If I think at a natural way to draw them, I imagine mirroring them either horizontally (the main stroke becomes top-right to bottom-left) or vertically (the main stroke becomes bottom-right to top-left). Either way I'm pulling the writing point toward my palm, and I am not covering the already written part of the character with my hand or the writing point.<br/><br/><br/>As for the word you are looking for, it's not "tonal", but "phonetic". Phonetic languages and writing systems represent the sounds of the syllables with one or more graphic signs, and those are VERY consistent. For example, Italian (my native language) is written phonetically. We have less phonetic sounds, true, but those we have are represented the same way every time. If an italian reads a word he has never seen or heard he knows how to pronounce it. The only point of confusion can be the tonal accent, which has a default, but it's not always that consistent. In those cases the tonal accent is often explicitly written.<br/><br/>E. g.:<br/><br/>"Anc\xf3ra" means "another time", or "again"<br/><br/>while<br/><br/>"\xc1ncora" means "anchor" <br/><br/>I think that referring to different alphabets/writing systems you are thinking about the different japanese systems: Kanji is derived from chinese writing and is the "main true language/writing", while Hiragana and Katakana are phonetic, and in particular  Katakana has a pretty simple transliteration method to reproduce (more or less) the perceived pronuntiation of the foreign word that the japanese need to represent.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121663/#Comment_121663" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T07:49:03+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  7:49AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: HinterWelt</cite>Hmm, I am sorry but I would disagree.

Wow, that makes me rethink the whole look. I think I have to go back to the drawing table. hmm, I like the curved lines as there is a lot to be said about that with the use of the claws. I also like the simple representation of characters. It makes me wonder if a component based ideographic language coule work here. You know, this stem means action, that stem means "immobile". The task would be what the stems would be and how combinations would "add" up.<br/><br/>Whole new way of looking at it.<br/><br/>Thanks again.<br/><br/>Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122213/#Comment_122213" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-27T14:54:02+00:00" title="January 27, 2008  2:54PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Bill,<br/><br/>A couple comments on "claw-writing": if they have different-sized claws/fingers that they use to differentiate lines, then line weight is subjective, based on the individual. This could introduce ambiguity in single characters. If the character is relatively simple, it will only have a few lines in it, and a viewer may not be able to tell how heavy those lines are, without reference. Are those thick lines drawn by a small Kiran, or thin lines drawn by a large Kiran?<br/><br/>This would be more of a problem with an alphabet (one sound = one letter, or thereabouts), where symbols need to be simple, since you write a lot of them.<br/>If symbols represent syllables, they can get more complicated, and if they are like Chinese, each symbol will probably be very different and have multiple line weights.<br/>It looks like you are going for complicated ideographs, so this may not be a problem you want to introduce into your calligraphy.<br/><br/>(To be clear - all scripts have problems, and building disadvantages into your fake scripts gives them character. I'm not suggesting this as a problem that needs to be solved, just something that might give it some color.)<br/><br/>Also, I think you should take another look at cuneiform. Even though it's mostly pressing marks, not lines, you can see a lot of parallel, or stacked marks. A being with multiple claws doesn't need to write with just one at a time. They could drag two or three claws across the clay (or paper), making multiple, parallel lines. You don't have anything like that in your calligraphy so far. If you want to get really into this, try fingerpainting with ink, and see what you come up with.<br/><br/>The other thing, is that you can poke holes in the clay with your claws, creating dots. Multiple dots, in certain configurations, if you use multiple claws/fingers. This doesn't translate over into ink and paper writing, though. Instead, the Kiran could make dots with their knuckles and finger-joints. This will end up changing the configuration and whatnot, but all scripts evolve over time. Even the touch-pad is going to change the ink and paper style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

It is one of the reasons I have started with the Kiran as I had experience playing around both with claws (I have one of those cheap raptor claw reproductions) in mud and with writing ink on paper. Surprisingly difficult that. The problem I have now is that I am not left handed, severely so, and I am not sure if my issues with left hand writing is because I am a spaz or what but I really cannot make any characters with it. So, I will have to just guess. What has been said earlier int he thread has been invaluable where this is concerned. I think my new letters will be more lefty friendly.<br/><br/>Thanks for the suggestion,<br/>Bill                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123340/#Comment_123340" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T09:51:50+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  9:51AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Try writing with your right hand, but flow the characters backwards, if that makes any sense.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Even the rigid architectural division between consonant and vowel is drawn from the Tengwar and (less rigidly) Arabic.
