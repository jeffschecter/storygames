What I was curious about was how we arrive at a specific tone for a game, and how getting there can cause problems. This is what I've come up with so far and I'm interested in your opinions.<br/><br/>I'm using tone here as the label for how all narrations and the like hang together, not in terms of content but in terms of style. As far as I can tell there are (at least) three distinct approaches:<br/><b><br/>The Auteur</b> - A single player (usually the GM) takes up the role of putting together the various contributions of the group into a coherent whole. This can mean he will also modify or outright reject certain bits of narration, if they are not compatible with his vision. As long as the Auteur's authority isn't questioned, this works really well and leads to a game with a reliable and recognizable tone. Since this requires no effort from the rest of the group, it is a very popular way to do things. <br/><b><br/>Interpreting the text </b>- Here, it is assumed that there exists a kind of platonic ideal of the game's setting/tone, which the group tries to approach during play. This ideal is expressed in sourcebooks (i.e. gaming fluff) and occasionally non-fiction texts, as applicable to the game (e.g. history books, books on firearms and ballistics, etc.). Instead of a single player's vision, it is the "hard facts of (chosen) reality" that shape the tone of the game. This approach seems to be favoured by people, who need a level of objectivity in their game world. <br/><b><br/>Grassroots democracy</b> - Here, everybody at the table gets an equal say as to the tone of the game. It's developed and negotiated through playing the game. This requires everybody at the table to engage with the game on both a content level ("What does my character do?") as well as the form ("How do I narrate this?"). In addition to that players must be able to handle criticism as well as articulate criticism well to keep the game running smoothly and tension-free. Most of all, players need to accept group decisions, instead of trying to steer them. If they don't, the whole thing usually devolves into a power struggle, with each player grabbing for the role of the group-approved Auteur. <br/><br/>I noticed that I usually link games like Paranoia and WFRP to an Auteur-approach, whereas I automatically switch to "grassroots democracy" with games like Primetime Adventures or InSpectres.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125101/#Comment_125101" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T06:09:11+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  6:09AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm using narration to refer to pretty much anything that's being said that affects the game. Stuff like "My character does this or that.", "Drugrog is very angry." or "The house is deserted and seems worn down by countless rains and storms."; but also everything that goes into acting 'as' your character.<br/><br/>Tone is supposed to refer to the style of the narration and as a result the style of the game. You could also think of it as 'genre' or the like. In a game like InSpectres the tone would usually be funny, irreverant or even silly. In a game of CoC the tone could be grim, somber or at least creepy. I'm using tone to refer to the style of the game, not the kind of atmosphere at the gametable or among the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125183/#Comment_125183" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T11:33:29+00:00" title="February  8, 2008 11:33AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't forget environmental elements (e.g. dim, candlelit play area for "serious" horror; music that inspires, etc).<br/><br/>Also, the implicit or presumed morality of the setting contributes a lot to tone. Four-color supers tends to draw out a freewheeling, righteous tone because we KNOW who's good and who's evil; whereas a game setting or genre where morality is relative and is always seen in shades of gray invokes more of a considering, tense tone as we try to ferret out what's Right and what's Wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125272/#Comment_125272" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T14:31:20+00:00" title="February  8, 2008  2:31PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your "interpreting the text" doesn't quite fit in the list: unlike the other two, it's more about "how do we know if this tone is 'right' or not?" rather than "who's in charge of maintaining the tone?"

The main characteristic of the categories is one of authority over tone: single player, texts of other people or group consensus. In that sense the title of the post is not so much misleading, as just plain wrong. It should say "Who sets the tone?". The "How" is, as David pointed out, far more complex than the few lines of put down in the original posting. <br/><br/>But unless you feel like there is an important type of authority missing, this thread can easily delve into how groups go about setting tone once they've chosen what they pick as their highest authority in this case. I'll try to add my own thoughts on the matter later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125427/#Comment_125427" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-09T13:35:35+00:00" title="February  9, 2008  1:35PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Filip Luszczyk</cite><br/>The "authority of the text" looks tricky here, indeed. This is because of the interpretation step. The text will always be filtered by someone - either by one person, or by group consensus, or sometimes by an agreement between certain members of the group. I'm not sure how this is actually different from the remaining categories.</blockquote>\nI've seen it treated and therefore presumably experienced differently by people who I'd put in this category. They'd refer to sourcebooks, non-fiction books or "realism" but never to their own or somebody else's subjective view on things. There's an implicit claim to objectivity by referring to something that's been created by somebody else. Basically stating "it's not my idea, but the objective truth."<br/><br/>I do, of course, see your and Ron Hammack's point. But the players I've seen promote this stance, don't think of these things as questions of taste or preference. Regardless of what we may think is "actually going on", this is what is perceived by the players at the table as such it makes sense to recognise it as one possible authority on tone. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Filip Luszczyk</cite><br/>Either way, I don't think it's really possible to build a consistent tone unless everyone at the table is ready to work towards this (even if "work" equals "don't get in the way"). This, however, requires the whole group to build an agreement in one way or another.</blockquote>\nWell, that goes without saying. But the question I asked myself was: where do players locate the authority in these matter? I came up with three answers: 1) the GM, 2) fluff texts and 3) themselves. I've added a caveat to the first, saying it doesn't have to be the GM but could be any other player. I've noticed that most players don't restrict themselves to fluff texts when it comes to arguing for a tone based on texts and I think 3) should be expanded to include that it doesn't have to include everybody at the table, as long as it's more than one person and as long as they consider themselves equals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
