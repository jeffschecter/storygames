Can you push again if you fail a second time?<br/></blockquote>\nIn my game, I let players push as much as they wanted, until they hit their maximum heartrate.\n<blockquote><br/>2: Do you always lose an attribute point from the attribute you rolled, i.e. lose Force if you rolled Force and Instinct if you rolled Instinct, or do you/Control choose which one is lost?<br/></blockquote>\nI believe RAI, you should lose the stat point you used.

Unless you're at your maximum heart rate.\n<blockquote><br/>7: When you push, you have to roll the same number of dice you rolled the first time, right?<br/></blockquote>\nWhat makes you say that?

Thanks for the feedback!<br/><br/>I think I'd want to be careful with letting people pushing as much as they want and then suffering no consequences other than the raised heart rate if they succeed on the final roll. Don't you get the effect that nobody fails a risky roll until they reach maximum heart rate?\n<blockquote><blockquote><br/>6: If an attribute drops to 0 and you have to make an Access roll to eject or die, can you push this roll? I would guess not?<br/></blockquote>\nI'm not sure why not. Unless you're at your maximum heart rate.</blockquote>\nFirst of all, it seems strange in the fiction. you're dying and you need to eject immediately or die. It seems strange that you can "try again". If you fail, you're dead or insane.<br/>Second, it seems anticlimactic in game, since there's not that "finality" of the roll. Rather, you streatch it out until it's no longer dramatic.<br/>Third, there's never a reason to not reroll until you reach your maximum heart rate. If you have a low Access and a low heart rate, you'd be rerolling loads of times, keeping track of your heart rate, until you either reach your maximum or roll an 11+. this seems unfun.\n<blockquote><blockquote><br/>7: When you push, you have to roll the same number of dice you rolled the first time, right?<br/></blockquote>\nWhat makes you say that? I'd let players continue choosing the dice until they leave their target heart range.</blockquote>\nI don't know. I guess it's no issue. I don't know why I assumed you couldn't change it.\n<blockquote>Agreed. I let people carry CP. When they have 10, they can spend them.</blockquote>\nRight. And of course you only get one CP per roll. But should it be one per attempt, or can you get two if you roll and reroll? I think I want to leave it at one per attempt, to discourage rerolling even more.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sdanic" title="sdanic"><img alt="sdanic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sdanic">sdanic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448031/#Comment_448031" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-18T18:53:50+00:00" title="August 18, 2015  6:53PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2015 4:33AM by sdanic.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I figured that, since they're dreaming, the only thing that can actually kill them is their heart rate.

It's already a bit weird that you get an automatic success when you're at that level (since there's no reason not to roll at least 11 dice), but getting an unlimited amount of CPs seems overkill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sdanic" title="sdanic"><img alt="sdanic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sdanic">sdanic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448056/#Comment_448056" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-19T09:12:46+00:00" title="August 19, 2015  9:12AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2015 9:15AM by sdanic.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.
