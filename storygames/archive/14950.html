And I am curious is my approach seems reasonable? <br/><br/><a href="http://they.misled.us/archives/1748" rel="nofollow">Extending Action Point Utility</a><br/><br/>I am going to cross post the body here for ease of access:\n<blockquote>4e D&amp;D is a game that is designed for combat as all the mechanics of the game sing within. Outside of combat, play is more loosely defined and most of the game\u2019s mechanics are no longer engaged. In this post I am taking a look at the utility of action points.<br/><br/>Action points are only usable within combat, they serve no other purpose than to give a player a free standard action once per encounter. It seems to me that we can open this up and come up with other uses for these action points. For inspiration, I have pulled from the concept of fate points from FATE.<br/><br/>On the right we have a sample power to replace the standard action point. Basically, we\u2019re looking at an at will power that can be employed for a variety of purposes, many of which do not specifically apply to combat. While the power is listed as no action, it is limited to once per round to prevent excessive use. Let\u2019s take a look at the possible effects we can achieve with this new action point.<br/><br/>Gain a standard action this turn<br/><br/>This effect is the standard action point effect, and is restrained by a special condition that it can only be used once per encounter. Its a solid effect, and there is no reason to change it here.<br/><br/>Gain a +2 bonus to a non-damage roll<br/><br/>This is straight forward, and perhaps the least useful effect for the power. It only grants a +2 bonus, but it can be invoked after die roll, which can be a life saver.<br/><br/>Press an advantage for a +4 bonus to a non-damage roll<br/><br/>This is largely situation. Basically, what we are looking at is allow a player to exploit a logical advantage they have within the fiction that is not regularly supported by the mechanics of the game. For example, a character may be attacking with a height advantage, or bringing up damaging evidence in an argument that sways the crowd in his favor. Situational bonuses are a pretty common DMing practice, this is just applying a specific mechanic for it.<br/><br/>Make a declaration<br/><br/>Basically, this allows a player to assert a minor fact into the fiction. This is not indented to hand wave obstacles or instantly solve problems. For example, a character finds himself in a dark dungeon without any of his possessions. He finds an unlit torch, and spends an action point to make a declaration \u201cthey didn\u2019t find my flint and steel\u201d so now he can light the torch. Not a huge deal, but helpful. This could also be used in other situations, for example the characters encounter a soldier. She happens to be in the army one of the characters is/was in. That player makes a declaration \u201cI know her from the war.\u201d While not directly important the declaration introduces some interesting possibilities for the story.<br/><br/>Invoke for Effect<br/><br/>This is similar to the the concept employed by press an advantage. Frequently in play there are events that occur that would naturally result in specific consequences that are not supported by the mechanics of the game. For example, say the characters set a boulder trap, and a monster springs the trap. The boulder strikes the monster, and does its damages, but that is it. So, one of the characters invokes an action point for the effect, \u201cthe boulder knocks the monster prone.\u201d Again, nothing game breaking.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>While these actions open up the action point to other areas of the game, they are still limited to being earned to once per milestone. But, now that we have all these fun new options wouldn\u2019t it be nice to earn more action points? I\u2019ll address that topic in a future post, but essentially my solution is to replace the milestone award with an award mechanism that uses something like the keys concept from the Shadow of Yesterday.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nUpdate: Fixed classification tag in subject                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Kauko" title="Matt Kauko"><img alt="Matt Kauko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Kauko">Matt Kauko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340681/#Comment_340681" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T21:26:05+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  9:26PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like your "make a declaration", although I usually go along with any declaration my players say anyways, but add a "yeah, but" or "yeah, and".

I did something similar for a 4e game I run for teens at the library. I was having trouble getting them to pay attention on their turn and needed something to turn that around. I decided to modify Action Points. On the players turn if they were paying attention I would give the a chip. Chip could be spent like this:<br><br>1 = +1 to roll, minor action<br/>2 = reroll, movement action<br/>3 = standard action (spending three for an extra standard would also fulfill requirements of spending an action point)<br/>4 = extra experience<br/><br/>It worked like a charm as all of a sudden my game became a lot more manageable. Players loved the chips and could give them away freely so if one player needed a few chips to succeed players would hand them over. If they had 4 left over they could trade them in for extra xp. So, if one player had 2 left over he could give them to a player he thought did well who also had only 2 and the player could than get more xp.<br/><br/>In addition I indirectly allow them to make declaration. They would ask "is there a horse anywhere nearby?" and I would say "for a chip their is."                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340818/#Comment_340818" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T09:15:07+00:00" title="August 29, 2011  9:15AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>If you can clearly classify what the most and least useful options for using a resource are, I think there is something wrong with your options.</p>\n<p>Also, I would hate to be the guy burning my APs to be like "oh I can create a light source" and someone else gets to use his to, like, skewer five orcs in a turn.

You also seriously disrupt the balance of playable races when you inject the ability to mimic them with a resource available to everyone. If anyone can snag a reroll in combat when they need it, why ever play an Elf?<br/><br/>I've never much wanted, or seen the need, to mess with action points as written. All the story stuff you can do simply by agreeing to give the PCs some agency in story creation, or, if you really feel the need to codify it, by creating a separate currency usable outside combat, or for effects that do not duplicate anything already available as powers or class/race abilities.<br/><br/>The compulsion to mess with these systems is something that overtakes every DnD player at some point, but I don't think there's any compelling design reason to just tinker around he edges like this, and the law of unintended consequences has a tendency to disrupt these efforts, even modest ones.<br/><br/>-JC                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller" title="jjafuller"><img alt="jjafuller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller">jjafuller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341601/#Comment_341601" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-05T08:22:02+00:00" title="September  5, 2011  8:22AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Generally speaking, this effort is just an attempt to find ways to engage a mechanic in the game that exclusively functions in combat. I dare say the fundamental weakness of D&amp;D games is that unless you are in a tactical encounter you hardly engage the system at all. I usually advocate that people play a game other than D&amp;D if their goals are different than the game's. However, that is not an option for many players, so I was responding to a request to increase the utility of action points. I dare say that few D&amp;D players are actually playing RAW, and they all drift to some extent due to gaps in the system, or perceived problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341650/#Comment_341650" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-05T14:39:08+00:00" title="September  5, 2011  2:39PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Right, sure, I'm not saying, "Don't do it," I'm saying, "Do it better."</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller" title="jjafuller"><img alt="jjafuller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller">jjafuller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341655/#Comment_341655" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-05T15:35:34+00:00" title="September  5, 2011  3:35PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            shreyas, I should have directed that last statement at Jim.

If you want a game where all anyone does is take the power that does the most damage, every time, offering the ability to tweak their powers in-game as needed instead of having to make choices when leveling is a good way to do it.<br/><br/>I'm pretty comfortable saying "Don't do it. You'll break the game and it won't work like DnD is supposed to after you do." If you want them to have Fate points and tags and whatever, then play using a Fate-based system. DnD doesn't handle fiddling with the engine very well. My experience has been that the groups I've played 4e with have all at least tried to stick pretty closely to the rules as they understand them. If youve played across many groups and found that not to be the case, it may be regional, or the fact that I play mostly in retail and Con settings. If youve not played extensively and are making a guess about a strong desire to rewrite the Action Point system, I honestly think you may be overestimating that desire amongst the core player base, and certainly amongst casual players.<br/><br/>OTOH, I've also never seen this advice stop anyone from going ahead and trying to MacGuyver it anyway, so let us know how it goes!

By this point, the PCs in my long-running game rarely toss Dailies WITHOUT having spent an AP because of all the Warlord-related spiffs they accrue when they do...<br/><br/>-JC                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341720/#Comment_341720" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-06T08:00:41+00:00" title="September  6, 2011  8:00AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One possibility would be to allow an action point to be spent on a <i>failed</i> daily or encounter power to allow the re-use of that power later. It's been a while since I played 4E, but wasting your "big guns" with bad rolls was the most annoying part of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller" title="jjafuller"><img alt="jjafuller" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jjafuller">jjafuller</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341794/#Comment_341794" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-06T20:36:13+00:00" title="September  6, 2011  8:36PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shreyas &amp; Jim-<br/><br/>Thanks for the additional feedback as it really helped bring home your concerns. As a result, I agree that this functionality should be decoupled from the action point system due to unintended rules interactions. <br/><br/>I am not sure that I agree with the notion that D&amp;D is not a very hackable game. I think it may be more a matter of where you are trying to tweak it. The combat system is very well tuned and as such does not graceful tolerate changes such as those I just proposed. The sweet spot may actually be the places the rule are silent. Basically, everything outside of combat. I have had success establish character relationships using a generation system similar to fiasco, and bonds from dungeon world. Stakes negations for skill rolls have also worked great.<br/><br/>Wordman, I think that suggestion probably suffers from the same basic issues, as there are specific properties that address this issue (i.e. reliable). <br/><br/>I'm going to talk to the person that requested this, and see if we can come up with an alternative "non-combat" currency that can be used to fill out that side of things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
