Scott here, I hope that I'm posting in the right category. I've been lurking around these (and other pages) for a while because I'm super-excited about trying an RPG with my game group but really have no idea where to start, and what might work best with my group. We play a lot of boardgames (euros mainly) but the closest that I've gotten to an RPG is Tales of the Arabian Nights. Anyway, I never really had much interest in role-playing games because dungeons and fantasy (and combat) don't really appeal much to my group or myself until I stumbled on RPGgeek only to discover these cool 'indie' games, many of which have cool little twists, and an emphasis on 'story' that is right up my alley. I'm a humanities-geek and liberal-arts educated; number-crunching isn't my thing, but I love stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't really know much about Role playing games in general--I've looked though some D&amp;D books on the store shelves but they never really spoke to me, and I'm sure that that sort of role-playing would be too complex for my group anyway--so I need a game that will help me learn the ropes. I'm really interested in indie RPGs but you just can't find them on the store shelves where I live so I'm not really sure which, if any, might be the best fit. From the research I've done, games like Inspectres, Faery Tales, Fiasco (huge movie buffs), A Penny For Your Thoughts (very cool-looking group story-telling?), Primetime Adventures (appears to be out of print), Breaking the Ice, Dogs in the Vineyard, and Grey Ranks (among many others) look really cool. Not that I'm totally opposed to a more traditional system--there are just so many options.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo where to start for a bunch of inexperienced players? Genre doesn't really matter, other than the caveats above. I can GM (I can handle a lot of rules, but the rest of the group has a complexity-ceiling), but GM-free is good too. I would just like to grab a game or two that is/are unique, story-oriented, noob-friendly, encourage imaginative, narrative-centered games, fun and playable. I'm open to any and all suggestions.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThank you so much for any help that you can offer!<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.

You can warp it to whatever setting you want (aside from the default mundane 21st century setting) and it's as family friendly as you want it to be.<br/><br/>The text is eminently teachable and very easy to read. You can start playing the game without having read a word of the rulebook (though having read the book is a plus), and there's a lot of advice in the later sections of the book for to read after you've gotten your feet wet. I think the pdf is $10 or something, and it's a steal. The physical book is beautifully laid out and comes with the pdf I believe.<br/><br/>I can vouch for Fiasco and Dogs, though those can be pretty intense, though in different ways. They have implicit violence, though. I've played and love both, and in fact Dogs was my first experience with indie games (I bought Burning Wheel first, but to this day have not had a chance to play it).<br/><br/>Primetime Adventures you can get in pdf, which I own. I've not played it but it looks like a lot of fun and the TV series paradigm is really easy to get into. Even if you've never roleplayed before, you've probably seen a TV series!<br/><br/>tl:dr: start with A Penny For My Thoughts or Primetime Adventures. After that I'd recommend Dogs and Fiasco, but if you aren't into the violence thing you might try Shock: Social Science Fiction or perhaps Archipelago II. I've played Shock:, but I've only read Archipelago.<br/><br/>Good luck, and please do ask for clarification if you need it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311602/#Comment_311602" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T01:33:26+00:00" title="February  8, 2011  1:33AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

If so, my advice would be to attend a local convention or check out your local store's event calendar, look at local meetups, and see what's going on. It's a social hobby, and I think you can learn the most by playing. Not only will you be exposed to different games, you'll get to see them in action and see how people approach them. For me anyway, that's the best way to learn. Conventions are really great, because you can try lots of things in a short time. If you could convince your crew to attend one with you, you could get a feel for a <i>lot </i>of different games.<br/><br/>If that's not really a possibility, I wouldn't worry about complexity at all. I think that's a misleading benchmark, particularly if you're willing to learn and facilitate the game yourself. All the suggestions you are getting are good games, so I'd pitch the ones that most interest you to your crew and see what settings, themes, and ideas they are most excited about.

It's hard to recomend a game in a vaccume.

PTA is out of print but is short enough that the PDF would work. Both games are very easy to learn and the content can be fine tuned to make it as family friendly as you need.<br/><br/>I don't recommend <b>Once Upon a Time</b>. It's competitive and I've seen many new players become frustrated by it. <br/><br/>I have not read <b>A Penny For My Thoughts</b>. I've heard rules wise, it's very easy and very fast to pickup. My only concern is the content. If it can be made family friendly, then it sounds like a good match but the default setting may not be a good fit.<br/><br/>Games like <b>GHOST/ECHO</b>, <b>Lady Blackbird</b>, and <b>The Pool</b> are very easy to play but assume you have experience with RPGs and in some cases, Indie Games specifically. The rules are short and super easy but explanation on how to use those rules is limited.

A lot of other games introduce the players to a game by teaching the least interesting part first (usually character generation).

I was speaking about how easy I thought games were for all the players, including GM who are new to RPGs. But there is plenty of subtlety here as many games may be easy for the GM but not the players or vice versa. For example, D&amp;D 4E is fairly easy for the players but less so for the GM (although to be fair, it's easier to GM compared to the previous version of D&amp;D).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_311659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311659/#Comment_311659" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T09:06:23+00:00" title="February  8, 2011  9:06AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel a bit surprised by some of these suggestions as while they are all good games (at least the ones I've read and played) some can be quite demanding for different reasons.<br/> <br/>The difficulty with a GM-less game is that gamers are expected to throw lots of story elements into the pot, which is great if everyone in your group is OK with this.  However, some people prefer to role-play by sitting back and having a world described to them by a GM, which puts an onus on the GM.  I'm not knocking either of these styles but would caution you consider the stances players sometimes have to take.  Also my experience of getting into Indie Games was confusing.  I looked to rule sets that were very rules and guidance light and this left me with questions that I have started to answer.<br/> <br/>Ghost/Echo I get now, but the ruleset for a beginner is daunting as it is so minimal.  Lady Blackbird is a better suggestion.<br/>Dogs is a great game and is facilitated by a GM but relies on an underlying conflict between the players throughout the game for it to sizzle.<br/>A Penny for My Thoughts is a great suggestion for a co-operative game.  It is well written and has an underlying structure that beginners can refer back to.<br/>Baron Munchausen is another great game but relies on players ability to improvise well.  If you "n00bs" are happy with this then go for it.<br/>You can get Primetime Adventures as a pdf from Indie Press Revolution.<br/> <br/>My own suggestions are Love in the time of Seid or Polaris.

Thanks for all the suggestions, that definitely puts a few new ones on my radar. I like hard-boiled fiction, classic literature (anything originally written in Russian especially : P), science fiction (space operaish, not the ultra techy stuff), I really like caper and espionage stuff as well, anything with philosophical, religious, and/or political undertones could work really well as well--Dogs and Montsegur 1244 look interesting on that front. Something like Fiasco has a lot of appeal to the film-buff in me. My hunch is that my group will probably be enthusiastic about anything that I'm enthusiastic about (at least at first), but so far, Tales of the Arabian Nights has been a favorite--that seems to have at least some RPG-like elements to it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as GMing, it will probably be me to start and I have no experience whatsoever with Rpg's (other than when we role-play through our boardgames). We're all big readers (mainly classic literature and modern mainstream fiction--for lack of a better term) but I'm sure that more genre-oriented stuff will work fine. As I think more about it, even fantasy could work, I'd just prefer to have less emphasis on combat.

The reason is that each player plays just their character and has a more limited set of responsibilities, especially regarding direction of play. Their actions are all in character and that's easier to relate to. In games I've played with Simon's pre-teen children, we also introduced "swine tokens" which you could spend for some limited narrative control (such as I've always known how to speak to snakes or there's a motorbike parked outside the shop).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ina" title="Ina"><img alt="Ina" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ina">Ina</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311912/#Comment_311912" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-09T13:46:17+00:00" title="February  9, 2011  1:46PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I second Archipelago II!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your gaming group is used to board games you may feel more comfortable at the beginning if you have a visual representation of what's going on in the fiction. And in Archipelago you draw a map (tried with kids -- works well!) while creating the universe the story talks place in. Also tokens representing the characters are used. And it's a rare king of game -- whatever you will do with it, it's gonna be fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd also disagree with Steve. It probably works only when the GM is an experienced one and players are really young (I mean: kids). But even then it's good to listen to their suggestions. Also, I believe that once you get used to the traditional pattern it's very difficult to change your habits.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen learning how to GM the games I find particularly useful are Dogs and Apocalypse World but they may be a bit too complicated for the beginning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Check" title="Check"><img alt="Check" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Check">Check</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311923/#Comment_311923" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-09T14:31:32+00:00" title="February  9, 2011  2:31PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco and A Penny... seem like they might work the best (they certainly look cool to me), still I'd like to find one that has a GM as well, so that I can learn what that is all about.
