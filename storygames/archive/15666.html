Proto-D&amp;D was immersive because you were solving the problems you were collectively picturing you would have if you were on a plane that crashed in a land where there were trolls. Mechanics of any kind, much less mechanics for playing a troll, came later in the development of role-playing games.<br/><br/>I see making a map of your exploration as a very pure and primal case of doing what your character is doing, which is interesting because Mike Mornard's stories suggest that it was a big part of early RPGs in the Lake Geneva play culture at least. (The OD&amp;D text tells you almost nothing about how to play, the big exception being advanced techniques for screwing with the mapper's head.)<br/><br/> I am doing a presentation at the American Culture Association / Popular Culture Association that is supposed to be about this idea; see if you can tell through the fog of academese and trying to write the abstract concisely under time pressure:\n<blockquote>\u201cThe Adventure Cartography Society: The Fantasy and Reality of Mapping\u201d Tavis Allison, Adventuring Parties LLC<br/> <br/>The maps created by participants in a role-playing game connect its imaginary space with our world. The map is simultaneously a real object, drawn by a person at the table according to verbal descriptions given by the referee, and a token in the game. If the character designated as the mapper is annihilated by a fireball, the referee may confiscate the actual map being made by the player of that character.<br/> <br/>I created the Adventure Cartography Society to enrich and deepen this fascinating correspondence. Members create maps of familiar spaces using the same cartographic techniques we apply to our gaming, and use these maps to move through space and gain experiential understanding of the units of space and time that quantize the kinds of actions we imagine our characters to be taking. Results from three experiments \u2013 mapping the author\u2019s apartment, a single block on West 113th St., and Grant\u2019s Tomb \u2013 demonstrate how the process of making maps de-familiarizes both the real world and the assumptions of fantasy, enabling us to see them with new eyes.</blockquote>\n<br/>Here's Victor Raymond's abstract from that panel; he has clearly invested more non-weapon proficiencies in academese than I, but I think the point is the same.\n<blockquote>\u201cMapping Secondary Worlds in Empire of the Petal Throne\u201d<br/><br/>The creation and use of maps in tabletop role-playing games has been recognized as a central element of game play since the publication of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.  Maps themselves provide both a sense of verisimilitude as well as an object of reference during game play.  In particular, the creation of a \u2018world map\u2019 presents the secondary world of the game as a frame of reference for referees and players.  This is similar to - but distinct from - maps created as reference works for fiction.  In either case, however, the successful evocation of a secondary world depends on the internal consistency of both the map and the world it represents.  \u2018Evocation\u2019 depends both on the preparatory work done by the referee and on game play involving referee and players, leading potentially to a sense of enchantment.<br/><br/>T\xe9kumel, the world of Empire of the Petal Throne, is an illustrative example of this process at work.  The creation of M.A.R. Barker, T\xe9kumel has been described in great detail, with elaborate maps and several different languages and scripts.  T\xe9kumel\u2019s maps and their presentation as game materials provide recurrent reminders of the act of sub-creation, but are in turn subjected to scrutiny by players possessing a modern understanding of maps and their meaning as cultural objects.  This tension between referee imagination and players\u2019 interaction has a direct impact on game play and subsequent \u2018re-imagining\u2019 of the secondary world on an on-going basis.<br/><br/><br/>Victor J Raymond PhD<br/>Adjunct Faculty<br/>Madison College<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355121/#Comment_355121" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-20T11:40:02+00:00" title="January 20, 2012 11:40AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I ran a d20 Modern heist-themed campaign, this was the absolute best part, because the vast majority of a session would be players themselves were standing around a table covered in maps, drawing Xs and arrows, gesticulating wildly and arguing about how to break into the target bank.<br/><br/>Side note: I presented a paper with a similar argument about the fantastic computer game Uplink: Hacker Elite, and how it acts as a kind of prop that allows the player to imagine themselves actually being a hacker (because the game has to run on a computer with a player sitting in front of it) rather than presenting a diegesis. My abstract is below - if you'd like to see the full paper drop me a whisper.\n<blockquote><b>Simulating genre in Uplink: Hacker Elite: the hacker sub-genre between cinema and digital games</b><br/><br/>\tThis paper will examine how the computer game Uplink: Hacker Elite (2001), developed by Introversion Software, engages with the hacker film sub-genre. Uplink, through its audiovisual presentation and gameplay, simulates high-tech computer hacking as seen in thrillers such as WarGames (1983) Sneakers (1992), Hackers (1995) and The Net (1995). Rather than representing computer hacking as it exists in reality, Uplink recreates imaginary systems that exist within the already-mediated \u201creality\u201d of cinema. The game's entire interface is made up of fully-articulated (but self-contained and fictional) versions of the fake software depicted in hacker films. As such, Uplink as software is in many ways more real than its cinematic counterparts, as it is an actual and functioning computer program rather than a mock-up or special effect.<br/><br/>\tNeedless to say, this raises some complex theoretical questions. What is the function of genre in video games? How are video games positioned within genres that originate in traditional narrative media? In other digital games, players take on the role of avatars within fictional worlds based on the narrative and audiovisual conventions of popular genres. In Uplink, by contrast, the screen displaying the game and the real-world space occupied by the player become part of the generic fiction. I propose that Uplink is a kind of \u201cgenre artifact\u201d that incorporates both the player and the context of play into its simulation, just as a child's costume might help to construct an imaginary experience of being a cowboy in a Western adventure.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355122/#Comment_355122" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-20T11:41:05+00:00" title="January 20, 2012 11:41AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Consider turning that around.

It's sort of like a fugue moment when the player and character becomes one, and it's always when the game feels at its most serious and intense.<br/><br/>So I tend to be of the opinion that challenging the player is actually more immersive in its own way than anything else in the game.

I especially liked that you could still be tracked after you'd disconnected, so you had to go and clean up the logs on one of the servers you'd bounced through in order to hide your traces.  After you put in some time, you'd get into a nice little workmanlike groove, just going through the routine on every job you're hired to do, like it's no big thing.  (And once you'd gotten your "bank kit" of software together and could grab all the money you wanted without anyone ever being able to find you, none of those jobs really were any big thing at all.

All the AdvCartSoc stuff has been in NYC so far, but I found Durham to be surprisingly rich in geo-caches; next time I'm down there let's organize some mapping parties, especially in the dark.<br/><br/>We used two teams of mappers, one with modern equipment (a laser rangefinder, a GPS device) and one trying to do medieval stuff like counting paces. Our goal was things like a dungeon map, so we chose right-angly environments like a city block and Grant's Tomb: we went down the street this far and saw this many doors, or we approached the tomb and paced out its exterior so that when we mapped the inside we might detect vacant spaces. We didn't worry about compass headings - even the "medieval" group mapped onto graph paper and we let that assign a straight-line bias; it sounds like you were trying to do a different kind of map. What we found was that, if you were going to move at speeds like OD&amp;D says you are moving when you are exploring, what the mapper is actually doing is jotting a sequence of notes about paces and things seen, which will later be used to sketch the map. The rule that you have to rest for 10 minutes after exploring for 50 could well be the time that the mapper insists everyone stop so the map can be updated before the notes get too hard to reconstruct!<br/><br/>The upshot of my experiments with the Adventure Cartography Society is that the conventions of a D&amp;D map - 10' distances and N/S/E/W directions - remove some of the challenges of measuring distances and angles presented by real-world objects. At the same time, in the real world you don't have some of the same challenges of lighting and materials and so forth. The degree of abstraction that makes it gameable is to move more or less to the pure mutual challenge of mapping a space, removing the details on either side that can't be shared. <br/><br/>The original Blackmoor dungeon map is notoriously not very interested in right angles or 10' intervals, and is some mix of unnerving and frustrating to modern players - even OSR types who are used to mapping megadungeons are used to the grid conventions that evolved later and became dominant in most play cultures (although the PlaGMaDA archives offer some weirdly-angled counterexamples). Playing with this "nightmare maze" led to the session in which I really bit into <a href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2010/10/13/blackmoor-dungeons-what-mapping-is-good-for/" rel="nofollow">what mapping is good for/</a>; the way that tension came unpredictably out of the details, which had turned out totally differently in an earlier session, is very relevant to noisms' original DW thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355205/#Comment_355205" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-20T18:06:25+00:00" title="January 20, 2012  6:06PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tavis</cite>Playing with this "nightmare maze" led to the session in which I really bit into <a href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2010/10/13/blackmoor-dungeons-what-mapping-is-good-for/" rel="nofollow">what mapping is good for/</a>; the way that tension came unpredictably out of the details, which had turned out totally differently in an earlier session, is very relevant to noisms' original DW thread.</blockquote>\nPersonally, a lot of that post's content is stuff I'd credit to dungeon design, separate from how or whether it gets mapped.  That said, I think you make a great point with this:\n<blockquote><cite>Tavis wrote:</cite>They\u2019re using their player map to tell me which way they\u2019re going to get back. I\u2019m following their progress on my DM map, watching to see if they take a wrong turn, and counting squares to see when I next get to check for a wandering monster. I roll these in the open, so there\u2019s a collective cry of relief each time I don\u2019t roll a 1. The players also cheer each time they work with the mapper to tell me which way they\u2019re going and I begrudgingly acknowledge yes, you\u2019re in an area you\u2019ve seen before. When they successfully used their map to re-emerge into daylight, there was a tremendous sense of<br/>accomplishment.</blockquote>\nI personally don't like the physical effort of drawing maps -- I find it interrupts my imagining being there, thus ruining my "sense of place" immersion -- but dude, that result you describe sounds awesome!  I love using maps for planning, and I also love the small but real possibility of getting lost!<br/><br/>It occurs to me that there's a way to get both: the GM makes a real dungeon map, and then re-draws an approximate map, rolling randomly to see how each part differs from the original.  So then the GM hands the players the approximate map, and then they may or may not run into a spot where it fails them.<br/><br/>If the game includes a Cartography or Direction-Sense skill, then the GM can factor that into their deviation rolls, and then offer the map as "this is the best your character could do".<br/><br/>My torch-waving friend did this with a group of players exploring a wooded hill at night, and the end results were excellent -- I heard that it was very atmospheric and intense, and half the players almost killed the other half when they stumbled into each other in the dark!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355208/#Comment_355208" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-20T18:27:43+00:00" title="January 20, 2012  6:27PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2012 6:29PM by Tavis.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>It occurs to me that there's a way to get both: the GM makes a real dungeon map, and then re-draws an approximate map, rolling randomly to see how each part differs from the original.

The players have full information about the board but limited control over their characters, who get lost according to a dice roll. You know where you want your guy to wind up, and hope the dice will let you steer him in the right direction. Some people on the OD&amp;D boards have extrapolated the game's different scenarios, in which you might play a military-trained and equipped scout or a hapless civilian, to suggest procedures like you imply where playing a ranger character means getting lost less often. This passes on to OD&amp;D and AD&amp;D 1e's wandering monster tables: a 6 means an encounter, but a 1 means you're lost.<br/><br/>I personally have never known how to make getting lost by fiat fun for anyone, and Outdoor Survival is no help; rumor has it that it was designed to settle a bet - "I can make a game out of anything!" "Oh yeah, what about getting lost in the woods" - and the ease with which an only-ever-played-once copy can be had cheap on Ebay backs up my personal experience that the game is interesting to contemplate but essentially not enjoyable.<br/><br/>Getting lost because you screwed up the map can be fun sometimes but requires a lot of effort in communication and trust. I enjoy mapping as a way to participate more fully as a player, but I am not very good at it. It stops being fun if the DM isn't patient with my attempts to make sure I understand the calling of directions correctly (this is why I sketch the map for players; my own calling is unreliable), and it has sometimes left me really angry if I feel like the DM scene-framed past important parts of the journey that I would normally have mapped, but then violated the implied promise that the map didn't matter, we were cutting right to the chase. I can enjoy getting into trouble because my player skill with the map let me down, or because there are fiendish tricks like teleporters and sloping walls, but it's really no fun to get into trouble because the DM didn't cooperate with the process of mapping and then screws us for not having a good map.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355217/#Comment_355217" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-20T23:04:34+00:00" title="January 20, 2012 11:04PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main problems I've run into personally with this is --  you're doing what your character is doing, but:<br/><br/>A: the character is a lot better at it than you, the player, is; or<br/>B: the character is a lot worse at it than you, the player, is.<br/><br/>I know it's not an intractable problem, but I've seen it enough to bug me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355219/#Comment_355219" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-20T23:25:36+00:00" title="January 20, 2012 11:25PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the less abstracted the process of describing whats going on, the more immersive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noisms" title="noisms"><img alt="noisms" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dragonsfoot.org/forums/download/file.php?avatar=7881_1233713790.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noisms">noisms</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355220/#Comment_355220" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-21T00:00:35+00:00" title="January 21, 2012 12:00AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>The main problems I've run into personally with this is --  you're doing what your character is doing, but:<br/><br/>A: the character is a lot better at it than you, the player, is; or<br/>B: the character is a lot worse at it than you, the player, is.<br/><br/>I know it's not an intractable problem, but I've seen it enough to bug me.</blockquote>\nHow often do these situations come up, though? I think generally speaking the things that your character is a lot better at than you are, are the sort of things that can't be represented at the table (combat, climbing, driving, mechanical engineering, whatever).
