My name is Oli, and I am currently working for IngZ-Inc, where we are working in collaboration with Marc Miller and the Traveller RPG community to create an iPhone/iPad port of one of the oldest RPG brands.<br/><br/>With this vast MMORPG we have tried to combine the very best of the latest technology, and the refined rules of Traveller. But we still want feedback from as many RPG players as possible before we launch the game.<br/><br/>Before you brand us as just another MMO, I want to point out a few key features.<br/><br/>We have a hex mode, allowing you to play in a traditional RPG setting<br/>The original traveller books can be used  in part to navigate and trade through the Traveller-AR the MMO universe.<br/>Players can create their own quest lines, and campaigns.<br/>We have incorporated augmented reality, letting you see ships from Traveller floating over your own horizon.<br/><br/>The key thing is that we are trying our hardest to bring Traveller to mobile devices, without losing the in-depth gameplay which made Traveller so great.<br/><br/>If you would like to join in on the free Beta (Currently limited to a few players, but opening up soon!) and tell us what you think, and how it can be improved, you can sign up to our beta, read the developer's blog and help the game grow at <a href="http://www.traveller-ar.com" rel="nofollow">Traveller-AR</a>. We would love to hear your feedback!<br/><br/>We also have a sweet facebook competition going for some Traveller goodies at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Traveller.AR" rel="nofollow">our Facebook page</a>!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335697/#Comment_335697" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-22T13:45:22+00:00" title="July 22, 2011  1:45PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I signed up for the beta of this quite a while ago, though I haven't been invited to play yet, and I'm quite enthused by the idea.
