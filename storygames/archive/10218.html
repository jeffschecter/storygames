I like to talk about that stuff too. On the internet, I like to write and post about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently, MSM asked me for advice on his game idea that he had posted on the Forge. He posted and contacted me off-list and specifically asked me to respond. Here's the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=28538.0" rel="nofollow"> thread</a>. Mike's idea was so broad and non-RPG-like, I felt compelled to present my thoughts on what an RPG is so that we could have a more productive discussion. I wanted to lay out a definition rather than saying, "This isn't an RPG" or "What makes this an RPG?" Clyde taught me that a provocative statement is better way to provoke a thoughtful answer.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/My%20definition%20%28of%20a%20boombastic%20jazz%20style%29">My definition (of a boombastic jazz style)</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">"[An RPG is] A game in which a player advocates the goals, priorities and survival (or doom) of a persona who, in operation of the game's mechanics, is confronted with one or more ethical choices."</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nI expected the definition to catch flak.  I said a naughty word in my definition -- "ethical." Gasp! Shock! It got a predictable kneejerk reaction and I got to curse at Cuntracycle. Cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it got me to thinking. I cannot come up with a reasonable roleplaying game that does not have at least one ethical question hardcoded into the game system/mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy definition of an ethical question: The player will be asked to choose between right and wrong, good and evil, the good of the individual or the good of the many, self vs group in the course of play (via operation of the game as written), etc. A bit of normative ethics and a smattering of applied ethics.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor examples:<br/>\nD&amp;D;: Good. Evil. Duh.<br/>\n<br/>\nShadowrun: You are Robin Hood sticking it to the man until he sticks you (and then you stick him back). Shadowrun even had racism in the game!<br/>\n<br/>\nRIFTS: Uh, in the core rules you can either be a mecha-Nazi or you can fight the mecha-Nazis. Hmm... And if that's not enough, RIFTS has alignments on page 14 -- principled, scrupulous, to miscreant, abberant and diabolic evil.<br/>\n<br/>\nVampire: You rape and kill innocent and powerless human beings while satisfying your carnal hungers and lust for power.<br/>\n<br/>\nGURPS: On page 10 of GURPS LITE 4e under disadvantages one finds a Bad Temper and a Code of Honor. I wonder if those would lead to ethical decisions in a game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not talking about "narrativist" or "gamist" or "simulationist" games. I don't even know what those terms mean. (My examples are conservative and traditional!) I'm talking about a fundamental quality that, to me, differentiates an RPG from a board game (or card game). You can have ethical boardgames, but for the most part, you're just pushing chits around trying to win, managing resources, staving off/accelerating the end game, etc. In an RPG, you're operating a persona -- an avatar on which we hang quite a bit of emotion. This condition lends itself nicely to associating or sympathizing with the situation of play and bringing our values to play to make a decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not saying that every decision in every RPG is an ethical one, but I do think that the core of RPGs involves an important decision by the player in which he weighs his value system against his options. And I'm not saying that players can't and don't behave like sociopaths in RPGs. Sociopathic behavior is just one possible answer to the questions presented.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my question to Story Games isn't really if you agree with me or not. I'm right. If you think I'm wrong, post an RPG and why there are no ethical decisions part of playing that game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I overlooking obvious games that fall outside the mode? I know there are edge cases out there, but am I blind to a world of RPGs that involve rote, valueless choices?*<br/>\n<br/>\n-Luke<br/>\n<br/>\nPS I wanted to post this on the Forge, but there's not really a place for this thread. it's about as far from a First Thought as you can get. Certainly doesn't belong on my site. Nerd? Nah. RPG.net...I dunno. Maybe. So, uh, despite our differences, S-G, you're stuck with me for the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Even though we know at this point that it's not possible to make choices outside of our value system, you know what I mean!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226998/#Comment_226998" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T22:16:31+00:00" title="August 23, 2009 10:16PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Luke-<br><br>My personal definition of a roleplaying game is pretty simple- it's an activity with both narrative/story, and game mechanics, and means for each to influence the other.<br><br>Whether or not a Story by default includes an ethical dilemma or choice is likely academic, though I suspect I can conceive of a compelling roleplaying situation that does draw its strength from ethics.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226999/#Comment_226999" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T22:17:09+00:00" title="August 23, 2009 10:17PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2009 10:17PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "[An RPG is] A game in which a player advocates the goals, priorities and survival (or doom) of a persona who, in operation of the game's mechanics, is confronted with one or more ethical choices."<br><br>I would have said "choices regarding their values", or summat like that, maybe?<br><br>I have to agree with other statements - the word "ethical" totally does strike me as being the odd man out - not quite right, but not wrong, either.<br><br>Then again, maybe I just want to pee in your cheerios so I'll like the taste better.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227000/#Comment_227000" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T22:18:30+00:00" title="August 23, 2009 10:18PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I posted about similar questions on my blog, <a href="http://simoncarryer.blogspot.com/2009/08/roleplaying-in-rpgs.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br><br>I think the way I break the issue down in that post is a useful way of thinking about it.

By singling out the word 'ethical', you promote it to a position of importance over other elements. Let's take an example:<br><br>Most of us would agree that a Vampire LARP is a form of roleplaying game. Therefore, when I am playing in a Vampire LARP and my character is jockeying for status, trying to depose the price and take his or her place, is he being confronted with ethical choices? From a perspective, yes, but when I embarrass the Brujah primogen simply to knock him down a peg, was my/my character's choice <em>about</em> ethics? Clearly not.<br><br>Another example:<br><br>Most of us would agree that World of Warcraft is a form of roleplaying game. RPG is right in the description. Therefore, when I am raiding and need to kill the big bad monster to take its stuff, is my character being confronted with an ethical choice?  From a perspective, yes, but is depriving the game world of one monster for a few minutes a truly meaningful choice? I would argue the choice was <em>about</em> something else.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227008/#Comment_227008" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T22:42:37+00:00" title="August 23, 2009 10:42PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Chris! That's an interesting one, because you certainly set up lots of room for ethical decisions to emerge. And players certainly make stands based on their values, but hardcoded? Perhaps not!<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone else: Attempting to explain away ethical decisions as central to RPGs is like saying that only robots play RPGs.

The mechanics of the game take place entirely on a relationship map; scene framing is turn-based, and involves connecting internal emotional issues to external personality quirks. Scenes are about revealing these, along with one-sided relationships. It's sort of meant to emulate a certain kind of movie and TV show out now, where wacky things are DRAMATICALLY REVEALED about the characters in unexpected ways, and you have to wait forever to find out if the person the main character has a huge crush on feels the same way. But yeah, certainly ethical choices can arise in the game, but the mechanics aren't there to make that happen. The mechanics only exist to create really interesting, flawed characters and to ensure that the story that develops is character-centric and not small-n-narrative-centric.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227011/#Comment_227011" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T23:09:01+00:00" title="August 23, 2009 11:09PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2009 12:19AM by Simon_Pettersson.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Luke!

In 3rd Edition, the only thing your alignment got you was allowed/denied you access to certain classes and prestige classes.  I think it's possible, likely even, to have a D&amp;D game whereby there is no ethical questions at all even if there is some role playing.  Many a D&amp;D session turns into just killing things because they are there.  There does not need to be an ethical confrontation in a dungeon delve, yet it's still considered role playing.<br/><br/>The same with Shadowrun.  Sticking it to the man is not an ethcial question.  Shadowrun does not ask whether its right to attack the Corporations or how you feel about, it says "You attack corporations."  I don't think the option to play a salariman (sp?) is available chummer.  So there's not a meaningful choice unless it happens in play.<br/><br/>I am also tempted to put RIFTS in here except that you can play both sides and both have unique values.  However, from GMing two Palladium Open Houses, I can promise you alignment gets ignored.  Everyone is Unprincipled or Aberrant.  Especially because there is no reason not to be.<br/><br/>It's not to say that ethical questions don't arise in these games, it's just that they don't have to.  So, those games go against your definition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227021/#Comment_227021" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-23T23:35:50+00:00" title="August 23, 2009 11:35PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill, please explain how the character can make a choice without it really being the player making a choice about what the character does.

The pawn is not a character, and I am not its author; there is no distance between me and the piece. Right? I am not saying anything about what it means or what it's like to be a lowly footsoldier on a medieval battlefield, and comments like "Oh, how brave!" directed at the pawn are taken as humor because they fundamentally mistake the pawn as actor rather than as instrument.<br/><br/>To call a game-piece a "character" or a persona requires a fictional world, a diegesis, within which the character acts; a game-board isn't enough. But given such a fictional world, every choice made by the player for the character is a kind of authoring in which the player reveals an understanding of the character (the "ethos" if you like) of the in-game persona. As an act of authoring, it makes a statement about the player's conception about how a person of her character's sort would or should behave in the given in-game situation.<br/><br/>My decision to attack or not to attack the game-piece adjacent to me for game-mechanical but non-fictional reasons doesn't fall into the same category, because I'm not authoring a persona in the fiction; I'm just playing a game.<br/><br/>By my reading, Luke's definition of role-playing is axiomatic; it recognizes that there's a fiction built into the game.

It's an activity. An RPG text is a thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs such, it's possible to play a game by the rules text of an RPG and not be playing an RPG. People have been calling D&amp;D; a tactical wargame rather than an RPG for far longer than 4th Ed. has been out. People have also been getting deeply moving RP experiences out of D&amp;D; for about as long. Just because people may not think about the choices they make in a game doesn't mean they're not making a choice. (You see two wounded orcs fleeing the burning village: What do you do?)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think Luke's definition holds water. If you're moving a pawn around based purely on tactical decisions, then you're not playing an RPG. You may be playing by the letter, but you're not playing by the spirit.<br/>\n<br/>\nChris,<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can play almost any sort of character in Shadowrun. Several supplements are devoted to playing non-shadowrunner characters, such as Doc-Wagon recovery teams, corporate security teams, or even rock bands and roving reporters. The rules themselves touch only lightly on ethical decisions, sure... But you can, by the rules, be docked karma for being a right bastard. The fictional content, which is as much a part of the system as the actual mechanics, can touch pretty deeply on ethical decisions. You've got corporate wage-slaves who aren't bad people who are constantly being caught in the crossfire. You can have close contacts and even friends who work for the corporate entities, who are representatives of "The Man".<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there are a lot of games which may not have a mechanically ingrained ethical question, but the situations they are intended to portray are rife with them. The situations that occur by natural extension of using the rules as they're supposed to be used will pretty much always have ethical decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, were I to modify it any, I would say that you are confronted with decisions that will reflect your values, which I think is a bit more to the point, and less loaded than "ethical". Of course, loaded may be exactly what Luke intends. As he said, provocative statements.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome games that may not have ethics mechanically represented:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Mage Blade doesn't make judgments of right or wrong, good or evil, but it sets up characters with goals, which will make a statement about the fictional values of the character, which are reflected from the players value.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Zombie Cinema simply sets up conflicts of interest, but in participating, you're making a statement that some outcome is valued, or not, by how you place your die.<br/>\n<br/>\nHm. It's actually hard to think of these. All the other games I've played or thought a lot about lately have a clear mechanical representative of ethics/values. Sorcerer (Humanity), 3:16 (Hatred for Home), Fastlane (Favors), Dogs in the Vineyard (Escalation), Sexy Deadly (betrayal/trust mechanics)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin" title="Kropotkin"><img alt="Kropotkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227040/#Comment_227040" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T01:05:47+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  1:05AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not certain that ethical questions are one of the defining qualities of rpgs (as there are lots wrinkles that have been pointed out by folks above), but I think that ethical/moral issues are central to <b>stories</b>.

I think the word "Ethical" is problematic in some of its connotations, but I agree with some sentiments in the OP (ala "Code of honour"), it's not entirely about morality, it's about your own personal ethics and code, so choosing which dream to sacrifice can be such a question.<br><br>See, the point about Paranoia, which I also made above-thread is, that what if the whole setting is one big ethical question poised, even if you don't look at it directly, even if you do not <i>address</i> it, so long as you do not just fail to notice it, then you are working within its confines, even the conscious choice to ignore it is done within the ethical realm. But it's the ethical realm of the players, and not the characters.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227079/#Comment_227079" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T06:41:30+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  6:41AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2009 6:46AM by Luke_Wheel.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Elizabeth.

Better luck next time!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Bill! You said it better than I could have!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Ron! I don't know those two games except for the bit that you create your character freeformish by writing down a list/paragraph of traits. Anyone know them better? Is there more there (in the text) that I'm missing?<br/>\n<br/>\nMigo, I haven't read Sea Dracula. What is it?<br/>\n<br/>\nGraham! Toon was my first instinct for an outlier to this definition as well, but I've never read it. However, I suspect, written into the game text is a discussion about providing opportunities for the players to use their characters to save princess and defeat tyrants.<br/>\n<br/>\nJason, Paranoia, dark and comedic though it may be, is RIFE with opportunities for ethical choice. Once you include politics, bigotry and oppression, I think my definition is inescapable. And Inspectres, too. Doing what's right for the company vs doing what's right for the individual. It's a game about start ups!<br/>\n<br/>\nDefinition disputers: You sound like a bunch of petulant high school students bored in English Lit. This class is for extra credit. No one's forcing you to be here.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan: I think the combination of embodying an avatar in a fictional world combined with the opportunity to make an ethical decision (<i>in addition to</i> making tactical and strategic decisions) makes RPGs unique and compelling. These aren't games <i>about</i> ethics, but games in which your decisions can seem to matter far beyond choosing to spend X points now to get Y benefit later. That's powerful and it only exists in a small selection of games (compared to gaming as a whole).<br/>\n<br/>\nRon: See Bill's comments above.<br/>\n<br/>\nLogos: There are other threads for you to post in here on S-G.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227084/#Comment_227084" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T06:54:37+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  6:54AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            By definition doesn't every game that has conflict resolution rules automatically have ethical choices hard coded in?<br><br>It would be hard to imagine resolving a conflict that is devoid of any ethical choice whatsoever.  And if those rules include the capacity for inflicting injury on others (physical, mental, or social) than how can they be anything but ethical choices?  Every Fantasy Heartbreaker in existance has at the bare minimum the choice "do I kill this creature or not".  Fairly bland...but there it is.<br><br>Even Toon...if there's someone who doesn't see the ethical choices being made in every episode of the Road Runner, or Sylvester and Tweety, or Bugs Bunny, or Foghorn Leghorn then you weren't watching the same cartoons I grew up with.  <br><br>So, is there a game that by nature of its existance never puts the players in a position to have to choose the path of right or wrong for their character...or even to judge whether their character thinks a given fictional act is right or wrong and how to respond to it.  Maybe "Coach Potato" the RPG of playing characters who watch TV all day...but even then...isn't watching TV all day an ethical choice?<br><br><br>Now whether its a useful or non useful definition is another question.

It's one of the reasons I find the game fascinating. It doesn't have a shared imagined space though. Is that what you mean by advocates, is that someone is guiding a character(s) through a shared imagined space? Do you advocate in Universalis? Do you have to?

The whole "what about RPG X which doesn't directly address ethical decisions" argument has weight, but I think falls down. I can't think of an instance of RPG play that doesn't involve ethical decisions, even in those generic games. That may depend on the definition of ethical. Does anyone have a good example of a game they played in where their character had no ethical decisions to make? Inaction is definitely a decision.<br/><br/>The "what about Donkey Kong" bizness is EPIC TROLL.

Hell, Talisman even has alignments (Good, evil and neutral). Or even this: you land on the same space as another player. You have the choice to encounter the square or attack and kill the other character. That's an ethical choice, right?</blockquote>\nSure, but it's not a choice faced by the persona in the fiction of the game; it's faced by the player. A "character" is Talisman is more like the boot in Monopoly than even a PC in a 4th edition D&amp;D game.<br/>Bill, is there really a character?<br/>When I sit around the table playing games, I only see players.<br/>I'm not sure this adds to the discussion.<br/><br/>Nathan, you can't see atoms either, but I bet you accept their existence. "Aha!" you may say. "But I can detect atoms by means other than sight."<br/><br/>Same with characters.<br/><br/>Role-playing relies on the existence of the in-game fiction, the shared imagined space, the diegesis: these are different words for the same thing. It's not players making decisions, it's not characters making decisions, it's players making decisions on behalf of characters. Part of what goes on in role-playing is our appreciation (in the sense of understanding) of the characters we play not as extensions of ourselves but as fictional creations that we author/witness.<br/><br/>Now I hear you saying, "You pinko narrativist hippie! Are you saying that my Step On Up isn't role-playing?" No, that's not what I'm saying. When my character in a WEGS demo (a game of pure dungeon crawl tactics) runs off the battlefield instead of staying with his friends and dying, I know something about that guy, even if I haven't bothered yet to give the character a name.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227121/#Comment_227121" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T08:01:54+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  8:01AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Definition disputers: You sound like a bunch of petulant high school students bored in English Lit.

It takes place in the fictional world of a construction site. Jumpman is a character in the story. When I play the game, I advocate his goals ("save the Lady!"), priorities ("do I grab the hammer and smash the barrels, or do I just jump over them?"), and survival ("Aaah! Barrel! Jump!"). Heck, the hammer even gives the player the choice between mechanical success (grab the hammer to smash barrels and score more points) and narrative success (screw points, get to the end of the level and advance the story). By Luke's definition, it's an RPG. <br><br>That's why I think it's a poor definition, and one that detracts from the more interesting question of whether RPGs -- whatever the heck they are -- <i>require</i> ethical choices.

Really, that's what ethics is, almost by definition. <br><br>So when I read folks saying "this game is about relationships, and so there are no ethics" I'm a bit boggled about how to proceed, because in my mind every relationship involves ethical choices and stances. <br><br>Oh, and comedy often involves ethics. Much comedy has an ethical basis, and either confirms or reverses expected ethical situations for its power. From animals harassing a hunter in Bugs Bunny cartoons to Bill Clinton gets a blowjob jokes -- there's ethics in all of that. <br><br>Which makes me think that there is a split between "board game logic" and "RPG logic" around ethics. Because in a board game you usually are assumed to be operating on a logical level about resources and tactical management (we don't ask why the black queen wants to kill the white king) where in RPGs you are usually assumed to be operating on a level of personal choice for a protagonist. Some games do blurr that line (I've seen people nearly break Monopoly by refusing to engage in capitalistic ethics as much as possible in the confines of the game), but there does seem to me to be something there. <br><br>It's also why I sometimes feel that certain gamist games almost become boardgames.

There's a pretty massive difference. One is America, the other is Staff Sergeant Lance D. Allen. One of them is a person, the other is a collective polyglot of a billion personalities so diverse that it can only be personified in the abstract. Taken to the specific examples given, the abstract political entities are even more abstract, because there isn't even a national identity. All there is is a space on a map and a color to identify your tokens. The only values in these games are tactical ones, and the specific ones that the player brings. There is no persona. You may still make ethical decisions, but that's only part of the definition.<br/>\n<br/>\nDamned crossposting.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour example with the robber can be considered an ethical choice, and is a good example.

(I think that many tactical plays have an ethical element to them. The rhetoric of competition, for example, is a very ethical in its character -- whether or not someone is a better person because they can defeat another in equal competition, if the competition was equal, etc.) However, I find it a pretty good functional definition for a broad-scope discussion of the issues. <br/><br/>So, when you're in a relationship what does it mean about you? Does the person you're with doing something right or wrong reflect on you? How do you chose your partner (if you ever are going to chose one partner) to be best for you? Or should you chose based on what's best for you or what's best for the family? The community? Should you marry for love? For a nice rack? These are all questions about who you want to be and how you want to live. <br/><br/>Another good definition for this discussion might be Aristotle's "self realization." For old Ari ethics was a matter of coming to know yourself so that you could act in accordance with your true nature. Someone who did that would do good and be happy. Anyone who did not (and most did not) would not be. Thus the ethical inquiry was a search for who you are, how you relate to the world, and what you should do about it.

Wolfe's got it (in #93). Bill had it way up thread. If you're still not getting it, stop posting, take a breath and reread their posts. If you still don't get it then, think about it for 10 days. If you still don't get it then, take a year off and let it roll around your noggin.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting it and disagreeing is cool with me! Not getting it and arguing about my terms or quibbling with the definition or the examples that I used is dumb.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPersona is key to the definition.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I play poker, I can choose to make suboptimal as well as optimal decisions. I can make decisions that affect my strategy across multiple games. I can make decisions that affect other players both strategically and socially. However, in the magic circle of poker, I'm not making any ethical decisions.* I'm playing a game to the best of my ability to win. When I play a hand in poker, I'm not doing so in service of a fiction being created among all of the players. If I make a sub-optimal play to hide my strength for later, I'm not doing it because my persona is a weak king, sacrificing his subject's well being now so that they will have the chance to rise up later.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiplomacy is an excellent example of a game tangled in ethical decisions. There are numerous ways to play Diplomacy, and being ethical is only one of them. But Diplomacy play isn't about a narrative. There's no persona (supported by the game in anyway). There's only you the player and your strategy to win.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may seem a subtle or useless difference to some, but to me this is a chasm dividing RPGs from other games. We use personas to create fiction so that we can make (or ignore) these curious ethical decisions in a safe place and then toy with the results in an imaginative sandbox. When the game's over, we can be disturbed by the choices or pleased with them. And we get to leave them at the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery cool.<br/>\n<br/>\n-L<br/>\n<br/>\n*Poker games that involve cosmic weight on the fate of the game or the winner throwing the game because of some moral obligation are the stuff for movies. They are beyond the immediate experience of playing the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227249/#Comment_227249" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T12:58:56+00:00" title="August 24, 2009 12:58PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenomouse</cite><cite>Post By: Mr. Smarty Pants</cite>"[An RPG is] A game in which a player advocates the goals, priorities and survival (or doom) of a persona who, in operation of the game's mechanics, is confronted with one or more ethical choices."</blockquote>\nIt's kind of odd how the conversation has largely focused on the phrase "ethical choices" rather than the rest of the definition, which is a lot more concrete.

I don't see how a great deal of D&amp;D play (which includes the way I play D&amp;D, by the way) fits with the definition.  Indeed much D&amp;D play is largely indistinguishable from many types of board/card games.  In fact there are card games (such as Dungeoneer) that try to replicate the experience in a more streamlined manner.<br/><br/>So the hard question to luke: Are you precluding D&amp;D played in it's rawest tactical beat-the-scenario format from the definition of RPG?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227275/#Comment_227275" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T13:27:29+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  1:27PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, choosing to ignore the situation is fine. I'm not negating D&amp;D's vulgar method of play. I'm saying that player+system+persona+choices inevitably leads to space in which rests a juicy ethical question. Playing a sociopath is certainly an answer to an ethical question in the fiction.<br/><br/>For every four "gun for the numbers" players you show me, I can show you one "why don't they ever do what I want them to?" GM. Those poor, frustrated GMs are setting up interesting situations with the Goblin King and the Dwarven Fungal Forests, fully supported by the game text, in an effort to create the aforementioned space. The players gamely plow through the question and slaughter everyone and take their stuff. Confrontation presented.

However, I think that a lot of D&amp;D play does fit into Luke's definition. <br/><br/>In fact, I think where a lot of D&amp;D play goes around the breakdown of things like old school, railroading, and so on are exactly places where opportunities for meaningful ethics are parsed differently. Edit for crosspost -- like in Luke's definition, where the players are playing a boardgame, the GM a RPG. And in other places where the GM wants to be writing a story, where the players want to play an RPG and say "railroading!" <br/><br/>Which is one reason why Dungeoneer and the like haven't ever managed to eclipse D&amp;D -- because in the end most folks may play D&amp;D very boardgamey a lot of the time, but in the end it isn't fully away from the ethical persona part of the definition.<br/><br/>I'd also add that its pretty easy to typecast D&amp;D play as "this thing" based on a small anecdotal and biased sampling, but that it doesn't really reflect what the majority of D&amp;D play does or does not do. In fact, a lot of the questions about D&amp;D seem to be more about the biased perceptions of a certain kind of D&amp;D play than about any sustained analysis of what D&amp;D actually does at the table. Isn't it Ron who said that D&amp;D discussions online almost always go wrong because everyone thinks they know what D&amp;D is but no one really does?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227279/#Comment_227279" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T13:35:58+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  1:35PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2009 1:38PM by Jesse.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So Luke,<br/><br/>So, if you're not precluding D&amp;D in its raw form are you willing to include card games that do the same thing.  I honestly do not see the difference between these two things.<br/><br/>Four people in a D&amp;D game.  The thief, the mage, the cleric and the fighter.  They go into a dungeon to rescue the princess.  They travel from room to room dealing with the encouters they find there until they find the room with the princess and either save her or die trying.<br/><br/>And a card game in which....<br/><br/>First we deal out the Thief card, the Mage card, the Cleric card and the Fighter card.  The rules say the object of the game is to rescue the princess who is someone where in the dungeon.  In the center of the table is the shuffled deck of "room" cards.  Each round we flip over a "room" card and we have to deal with whatever we find there.  In the end we either save the princess or die trying.<br/><br/>Jesse<br/><br/>P.S.

MMORPGs and CRPGs vs TTRPGs are completely apples and oranges.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227329/#Comment_227329" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T14:40:10+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  2:40PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh you'll get no argument from me there, either.

There are numerous ways to play Diplomacy, and being ethical is only one of them. But Diplomacy play isn't about a narrative. There's no persona (supported by the game in anyway). There's only you the player and your strategy to win.</blockquote>\nI disagree.<br><br>Diplomacy, especially when played remotely (i.e. through email or mail) is all about a player constructing a persona and using that persona when interacting with the other players. Good players know precisely that they are doing this. They will, in fact, very carefully craft their responses and demeanour in their messaging to other players, in order to direct the play to their advantage. In fact, if you play the game without a persona strategy, without creating a personality and a rhetoric to cope with the other players at a meta-game level, then you'll quite often find yourself in a position that's untenable very quickly.<br/><br/>The built-up history of the game <i>depends upon narrative</i>: the proceedings of the game, including the press, makes the narrative quite important as players bind up the story of the proceedings into their projected persona and the persona's continued interactions with the other players. The relation of the narrative may, or may not, and in fact sometimes purposefully does not, bear <i>much relation at all</i> to actual in game events (but rather can propose a more or less reasonable interpretation of game events). <br/><br/>Is Diplomacy a rolegame as we have come to know them? I'm not sure is the plain answer. Is it like Prime Time Adventures? No, I don't think so. Is it like DnD4e? Welll.... maybe some aspects are similar... Is it like Capes? Well, hmm... now we're getting even closer to similarity somewhat.<br/><br/>I am intrigued by your comment "no person (supported by the game in anyway)". I cannot particularly remember whether the Dip rules themselves advocate "assuming the role of your foreign power during negotiations", but I can tell you from repeated play that players quite often will do this to one extent or another, and press during a game can sometimes be quite similar to the kinds of exchanges seen during a rolegame.<br/><br/>In fact, of most of the boardgames with which I'm familiar, the player interactivity and meta-gaming aspects of Diplomacy make it a <i>very poor choice indeed</i> to hold in opposition to rolegaming, if what you're trying to hang your hat on is this whole notion of constructing a persona.<br/><br/>And, in fact, I'm not sure that "constructing a persona" isn't vital for <i>all games</i>, and that it's <i>never</i> "only you the player and your strategy to win". I'm not sure that <i>every time we play any game</i> we aren't in fact building up a persona that is the player's medium through which they interact with the game's rules and the other player's personae. An observation I offer that this may be the case is the insistence that people have that "players should not take games personally, because they're 'just games'". There's some sort of detachment going on here, and I don't see rolegames as unique in that regard.\n<blockquote>We use personas to create fiction so that we can make (or ignore) these curious ethical decisions in a safe place and then toy with the results in an imaginative sandbox.</blockquote>\nI find this point a bit more compelling. Assuming that we construct a persona for all our games, what do we <i>do</i> with that persona when we're playing. You assert that, in the case of rolegames, it's not about a "strategy to win", but it's about "creating fiction so that we can make ethical decisions" at some distance.<br/><br/>I find that an interesting assertion and I'll have to think about it. But again, I have a feeling that this, as well, is not a distinguishing factor, otherwise, why would people derive such pleasure from relating the (shared) experience of their games (role, board, sport, and so on)? There is always some narrative that's bound up in the notion of "the game", I think. The narrative is the tale that unfolds between the game personae during the context of play, and the revelling and enjoyment of this narrative and its intertextualities is evident in the follower, observer, or "fan" role during and after the fact of play.<br/><br/>And, I also think, that much of rolegaming is bound up in "strategy to win" and not "narrative for narrative's sake": much of what we do when we rolegame is manage the resources of our personae in direct conflict with obstacles proposed by the game's context, in order to further the existence (and indeed prosperity) of the personae within the game. Just as the Diplomacy's persona's goal is to reach 18SCs and "take over Europe" (and, I'd argue that this is the true goal of the Dip persona, and that the elimination and failure of the other personae is only a side-effect of this underlying goal), the rolegamer's persona goal is to acquire experience and use the resources gained in game, (social, economic, personal) to further the goal of survival and gain of more "experience".<br/><br/>It's conceivable that the "telling a good narrative" is only a side-effect of the underlying goal.<br/><br/>There's a lot of meat on this bone. I don't claim to have it all figured out. Your point about personae, narrative, and ethical choices is interesting, but I don't think they uniquely define rolegaming: I think they might reach a bit further than that.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227335/#Comment_227335" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T14:48:48+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  2:48PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet heaven, this thread is moving too fast.

"You're a lawyer." Lawyers by definition, I think, involve ethical arguments and decisions.<br/><br/>I'm still not certain what Sea Dracula is based on your description, but if it is an RPG, I'm afraid it too falls to the knife. Based on that rough description, the rules text nudges players to a place in which they can make an ethical decision.<br/><br/>Viktor: sounds like you have your own very specific, very defined thesis that incorporates every game ever. Good luck with that.<br/><br/>John: I'd have to see the text for Toon, but I'll bet that there's stuff in there about doing the right thing or overcoming villains.<br/><br/>Omnes: I really am only talking about Pen and Paper, Table Top Roleplaying Games. Smearing the definition around to include Mass Effect and Warcraft isn't helpful. Differentiating various RPG branches is a whole different line of thought.<br/><br/>Omnes: With a definition as a rule of thumb, we can go and look at designs and see how they enourage play. To see what space the games leave for the players' decisions and what types of decisions the games incentivize. Again, that's for a different thread.<br/><br/>Omnes: It has been brought to my attention that OD&amp;D has alignments. I came in with the Basic/Expert sets and I can't find my copy of OD&amp;D. So I'm not certain about this, but if this is true, then the Great Progenitor Text fits neatly in the definition. <br/><br/>-Luke<br/><br/>-L                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227420/#Comment_227420" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T22:39:01+00:00" title="August 24, 2009 10:39PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2009 10:44PM by Johnstone.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>John: I'd have to see the text for Toon, but I'll bet that there's stuff in there about doing the right thing or overcoming villains.</blockquote>\nNo. The game tells players to act and not think, the example adventures are all competitions. No saving princesses. There are rivalries, but no "villains." On the other hand, the list of example beliefs/goals in chargen perhaps introduces an ethical dimension.<br/><br/>However, in Toon, like in old cartoons, any ethical dilemma in the motivations is just an excuse to have zany stuff happen. If your decisions never have any lasting effects, can they still be ethical? If the answer is no, well there you go. No ethics. If the answer is yes, it sounds like you're saying all human interaction is about ethical dilemmas, in which case your definition might as well be "Role-playing games are rules for pretending to be somebody else and interacting with other people pretending to be somebody else," because when those fake people interact, you get ethics. See what I'm sayi...<br/><br/><br/>Actually, y'know? Why am I even thinking about this? Fuck you, Luke, and fuck your useless definition. Who cares what a role-playing game is? Do you? Not enough to take the 5 or less minutes to find and read Sea Dracula, after asking for just such a suggestion in your OP. You could at least say "thank you for the suggestions."

However, I don't necessarily think that the development of a persona, the production of a narrative during play, or players making ethical decisions through the lens of their personae are all attributes unique to roleplaying. It seemed clear from your statements that you did. I disagreed.<br/><br/>Heck, I'm not even sure that all the things that we typically call "roleplaying games" are as alike to each other as some of them are alike to things that we typically <i>don't</i> call roleplaying games. I strongly suspect that the most defining characteristic of roleplaying games is the community within which they're produced and played (i.e. these games are identified by their writers, publishers, and players as "roleplaying"), and even on that there's been historic disagreement (I remember the heated discussions about Wallis' "Adventures of Baron Munchausen" when it came out, about whether it was an RPG, why, why not, and it seemed that one of the foundation points of the "yes, it is" crowd rested on the fact that it was written by someone and published by someone who seemed already involved in the hobby).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227494/#Comment_227494" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T07:26:49+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  7:26AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2009 7:28AM by Ben_Johnson.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>"[An RPG is] A game in which a player advocates the goals, priorities and survival (or doom) of a persona who, in operation of the game's mechanics, is confronted with one or more ethical choices."</blockquote>\nAt the risk of entering this thread very, very late...<br/><br/>This sounds like a good encapsulation of the Burning* RPGs. I think it's probably broad enough to be arguably applied to most games, although it depends on what meaning is inferred by several words.<br/><br/>"A game in which a player advocates the goals, priorities and survival (or doom) of a persona" could be read as eliminating any game where a player advocates for more than a single persona, by necessity of the article <em>a</em> indicating <em>singular</em>, but seeing as how this would eliminate any game with a GM, such as the Burning games, I cannot believe that it was intended as such.<br/><br/>The phrase "survival (or doom)" is weak sauce. I think what you're saying here is that the player is advocating for survival unless it runs counter to any goals or priorities the persona puts above its own survival, meaning that survival is just a particular example of a priority. This definition ignores story-telling games where the player might suddenly decide to willfully ignore the goals and priorities of the character in favor of fulfilling an emergent narrative for the delight of the players/audience. If you're comfortable with making that kind of division, then great. If you're not, you need to change the definition.<br/><br/>"In operation of the game's mechanics, is confronted with one or more ethical choices" hangs on the meaning of "confronted" for me. If the players of the game go around killing indiscriminately without a thought, are they really "confronting" ethical choices? If the lexicon of the game's mechanics do not equally favor "good" choices and "evil" choices within the magic circle of the game, is that tacitly removing ethics from the equation? Put another way, if a game gives you a sword that takes away HP, and confronts you with pinatas made of HP and full of Reward Tokens, is it really a confrontation with an ethical choice, since there are no other mechanics for confronting HP pinatas?<br/><br/>Even if the magic circle does not mechanically remove the ethical choice, if the players do not recognize the ethical choice at the time, can they be said to have made one? If players see the ethical problem themselves, but willfully play characters who don't see it, is that confronting an ethical problem, or not? I think Gregor Hutton's <strong>3:16</strong> advocates this sort of scenario while players are in the lower ranks. Who, in your definition, is confronting the ethical choice, the player or the character? My guess is that this only refers to the character, because the definition says the ethical choices must be mechanically supported, and only the character's actions are bound by the mechanics of the game. The player is ultimately always aware that the character's world is an imagined fiction, and thus no true consequences result from actions, rendering it ethically void outside the magic circle.<br/><br/>What this definition says to me is, "RPGs should make players advocate for the goals and priorities a persona, and, by way of the game's mechanics, make ethical choices." This is a great statement, because it raises all sorts of good questions for designers to think about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227500/#Comment_227500" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T07:43:21+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  7:43AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>A definition is, however, a way of drawing boundaries between this and that.

"You're a lawyer." Lawyers by definition, I think, involve ethical arguments and decisions.<br/><br/>I'm still not certain what Sea Dracula is based on your description, but if it is an RPG, I'm afraid it too falls to the knife. Based on that rough description, the rules text nudges players to a place in which they can make an ethical decision.<br/><br/>-Luke<br/><br/>-L<br/><br/>No, not really. Since it's a free download, and 2 pages long, I'll just point you towards the download at <a href="http://seadracula.wordpress.com/free-dracula/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://seadracula.wordpress.com/free-dracula/</a><br/><br/>Certainly you'd draw those conclusions about ethics based on it being lawyers, but that's entirely based on what you choose to put into it, not what the game actually requires. It's at its heart just light hearted fun, and could be just as usable as a non-shitfaced-retarded drinking game as a venue to explore ethical issues.<br/><br/>I'd overall agree with your definition if ethics weren't as key a point, and it were more presented in the fact that RPGs can be a venue for exploring ethical issues, but presenting it as a core characteristic of the game is where you're having problems. Not all RPGs are going to have ethical issues in them, depending on how they're played, so the definition doesn't stand because there are some examples which clearly are RPGs that don't fit it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227506/#Comment_227506" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T07:58:40+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  7:58AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Migo:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite><br/>Right, Sea Dracula.

The point is that when you make "ethical choices" a part of the definition of an RPG, as an RPG designer there's a tendency to view it as part of a checklist of things to include, even if it's probably better to let it be an emergent element. But, that's why definitions and models are necessarily nothing more than starting points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227592/#Comment_227592" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T11:29:17+00:00" title="August 25, 2009 11:29AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2009 11:29AM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>Ewen,<br><br>Oddly, I'd be inclined to go the other way.

I did not read all of the posts because there are so many. Forgive me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI disagree that an RPG must include ethical choices. Someone mentioned logistical, strategic, tactical, etc. You can play an RPG in an ethical way, and some games like Dogs in the Vineyard encourage some sort of ethical consideration (though that game doesn't force you to decide ethically), but not all games are strictly about ethics. D&amp;D is a hack and slash rpg. The rules are "go into the monster lair, kill the monster, take its stuff." Yes the game is about good and evil, but you aren't asked whether confronting this evil is right or wrong. It is simply what you must do. There is no choice in the matter (not from a game rules perspective). A lot of what happens is tactical. If you confront a dragon, do you ask yourself is it right to kill another living creature, or do you consider your options in defeating, or bypassing this great danger? Rifts isn't much of an ethical journey either. The rules breakdown to "get powerful, blow stuff up, get more powerful." Could you be honorable Grunts and Dog Boys? Sure, but the Coalition is set up as a totalitarian powerhouse, and many of the other groups are trying to fight against it while also being druggies (Juicers), for example RPGs can include ethical choices, but there are other kinds of choices that make an rpg, so I wouldn't limit them to ethical choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227758/#Comment_227758" name="Item_163" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T22:09:06+00:00" title="August 25, 2009 10:09PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>Just like all of the theoretical nonsense that's emerged in the past 10 years, this is useful because it helps us understand what we're doing.

Took me some gyrating but I'm here.<br/><br/>I had started reading this thread at home, got about 10-20 messages into it, then some time later changed browsers. Not realizing that all the posts I hadn't read were now marked as read, I read a few new posts and started thinking and writing. I got involved in Bill's thread, too. I wrote some pretty good stuff. Now, now being able to sleep because of a fucking cold, I come back to the first browser, realize my mistake, and catch up on the back-posts in the thread. Now I realize that all my pithy ideas repeated crap other people had already said. <br/><br/>I still maintain that the definition could use some tuning but I agree with it.<br/><br/>I think once you have a\xa0<i>persona</i>, that implies a Character within a context. That context includes place and time (Setting and Situation). Once you engage the character "in operation of the game's mechanics" (i.e., via System and Color), you have to make choices for ("advocate") that character. You're not making choices in a vacuum or outside a context or even outside an ethical context because of the aforementioned stuff. Those choices necessarily engage ethics, because they're choices about a fictional character's life.<br/><br/>I had a paragraph here saying that bringing ethics into things just confused matters, but then I wrote the paragraph below about Toon. Thinking about an RPG not as an opportunity for ethical choice but as a persona's context that implies a\xa0<b>fictional ethical system</b>\xa0jives with Luke's definition and offers a new way of looking at game design and play--which is, I think, what Luke was getting at all along.<br/><br/>Toon holds up as an RPG under this definition. You have a persona in a situation and you're making choices for that persona within that context. An ethical system is necessary for decision-making. What does Bugs do? It depends on Bugs' ethical system. <br/><br/>Monopoly and Donkey Kong fall down as RPGs because you don't really imagine yourself as the token (as the thimble or car, or as Mario). You're not making decisions as if you were the thimble or Mario. You're playing in pawn stance. There's a "character" but it's not a persona ("mask") so you're not empathizing with the situation of that character.<br/><br/>World of Warcraft, on the other hand,\xa0<i>can be</i>\xa0a RPG if a player engages her character through a mask (with empathy). If one plays in pawn stance, however, it's not really an RPG, right? But I spent a fair amount of time playing a WoW paladin who refused to kill small, helpless animals or even help other characters who did so. I refused certain quests because "my paladin" (I) found them abhorrent. That's role-playing. (Even on a non-RP server.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227786/#Comment_227786" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T03:18:02+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  3:18AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everyone stop posting to this thread now.

HOWEVER, your definition *implies* something about play about which simply isn't true.<br/><br/>Since RPGs take a narrative format, pretty much by definition play is going to involve ethical situations (it is almost a tautology, as someone said earlier).   However, your definition implies that these ethical situations are the *point/focus* of play. That's simply not true across the spectrum of play styles... and you know it.<br/><br/>Your definition has a Narrativist/Story-Now/thematic-play bias, where ethical/moral/thematic issues ARE the focus of play. But when it comes to Gamist or Simulationist play, ethics aren't the point. Sure, ethical decisions get made, but they are more of a byproduct than something the players are actively engaging.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Persona"</span></b><br/>This part I very much agree with, though I would rephrase it. Rather than say "persona"---which implies a character---I would say that players pursue a particular "story/game interest". What I mean is, instead of thinking of Bob playing Barku the Barbarian, Bob is playing the role of the protagonist.<br/><br/>I feel explaining it that way makes it easier to understand the role of the GM, who obviously has an agenda (antagonism/opposition), but is controlling varying and divergent characters, as well as other narrative elements like the environment. I feel my explanation also explains certain phenomenon, like why players enjoy hosing their own character, which would seem to run counter to your original definition. (Protagonism requires antagonism/opposition to flourish, thus the player actually has an interest in the type and intensity of antagonism/opposition that the character experiences.)<br/><br/>I admit that "pursuing a particular interest" is just a play technique, and as such, it's possible to design a game that doesn't require it. However, after several years of thinking about all this stuff and playing experimental games, I have come to view this "playing a (story/game) role" thing as a defining element of the "RPG" genre. Like I said, you can a make story game without it, but without it the game will feel like something different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227813/#Comment_227813" name="Item_171" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T07:03:50+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  7:03AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2009 7:16AM by Brad_J_Murray.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty sure that Diaspora has no built-in ethic that players will address in-game, but on thinking about it I suspect that one gets developed by the table during the cluster creation process.

Just because a quality is within all instances of a thing doesn't necessarily mean we should include it in it's core definition.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you take Toon, or probably most comedy type games in general, sure you can have ethical situations, but ethics isn't really a defining factor of what makes the game Toon. To say that all comedy games are defined by ethical situations seems odd to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Halfjack above, I think conflict is a better defining factor. Conflict includes ethical situations, and better defines RPGs. RPGs are about stories; stories are about conflicts. Games in general are about conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227835/#Comment_227835" name="Item_175" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T09:34:07+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  9:34AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On the whole "you're always making ethical choices in play whether you realize it or not" front, a metaphor: It's like when a little kid asks for pepperoni pizza, he's electing to support agribusiness and its unethical animal-treatment practices.

Yeah?<br/><br/>I'd be on-board with that. I think it'd also clearly set games like Universalis outside of RPGdom. I'm also then thinking about games in which there are moments of play where you engage with the fiction outside a persona. Hm. "Engaging with the fiction" might not be the right phrase. <br/><br/>I'm thinking about Story Triggers in Sufficiently Advanced. It's a system by which anyone at the table can build a 'the story will go in this direction under these circumstances" type of thing. So the actual at-the-table play experience with Story Triggers is at the player level. So they're engaging with...the fictional setup, I guess. But it's mechanically constrained, so there's still (some) game to it. It's more procedurally formal than, say, working out Beliefs in BW. <br/><br/>So SA might be one of those funky games where the RPG is the minigame within the bigger game (also Universalis, also Lxndr's rough-draft Ensemble game).

However:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I had a paragraph here saying that bringing ethics into things just confused matters, but then I wrote the paragraph below about Toon. Thinking about an RPG not as an opportunity for ethical choice but as a persona's context that implies a\xa0<b>fictional ethical system</b>\xa0jives with Luke's definition and offers a new way of looking at game design and play--which is, I think, what Luke was getting at all along.</blockquote>\nI think there's value in talking about fictional ethical systems in RPGs, so I'm not going to quibble with the inclusion of ethics in the definition.

Life, Chutes N Ladders, Marbles, Don't Wake Daddy, etc. are not rpgs in any sense, so they don't even enter the equation. Soldiers who shoot prisoners are not simply following orders because shooting prisoners is a war crime. A better example would be soldiers tasked with raiding what the commanders believe is an enemy stronghold, blowing it all to hell, and then finding out it was filled with women, and children.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the comment someone made about fictional characters living in a fictional world have fictional ethics. Is there something wrong with "roll" playing because the focus is on tactical conflicts rather than moral choices? Are all "role" playing games played with moral choices in mind, or just meaningful choices? rPG vs RPG? Little r because the focus is considered less grand (i.e. tactical over moral).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes to the ethical choices of pizza, you have to also consider free-range pizza. I order from farms where pizza is allowed to roam free. They corral my pizza, and very humanely put it down.

People already use RPG, and they mean something by it.  The new definition isn't trying to ferret out what most people mean when they say "RPG" -- but rather trying to associate a new definition that they don't mean onto a word they're already using.  That's adds to confusion rather than  to clarity.  <br/><br/>I think with equal validity, I could give a definition of RPGs that centers on violence (which can be emotional or intellectual as well as physical), or on emotion, or on narrative, or on problem-solving rather than on ethics.  These all occurs in any example of RPG play with sentient characters.  It's fine to emphasize ethics in one's own RPGs, but I don't think it's any more or less central than other human qualities.  I think a better approach into the topic would be to either ask or make an assertion about how central ethics are to people in their experience of playing RPGs.  I think it's great to look at ethical implications of existing RPGs.  For example, I posted <a href="http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/74081.html" rel="nofollow"><b>Social Class in RPGs</b></a> a while back.  <br/><br/>Out of curiousity, there are board games -- such as Therapy, or Scruples, or Oikos -- that are designed to present players with ethical dilemmas.  Are these role-playing games?  Would a minor tweak of them make them RPGs?  i.e. If I add a character sheet to Scruples, does it become an RPG?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228068/#Comment_228068" name="Item_215" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T04:16:10+00:00" title="August 27, 2009  4:16AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I somehow STILL can't quite accept this definition, because I think there are meaningful choices entirely separate from ethics.

And a discussion of to what is the ethical question applying.<br/><br/>Your character is in a situation which requires a decision on a matter of ethics, say take the treasure against save the prince. As a player making that decision, are you making an ethical, an aesthetic or some other kind of decision (one based around GNS for example)?<br/><br/>There are other ethical issues around roleplaying such as "Should we play pedophiles?" but these are of a different, meta, order to those which Luke is referring by my reading. And in any case, it's important to separate the two.<br/><br/>To a certain extent the question of the ethical decision also involves the one of identification with the character and that of the role of play. "Do the choices I make for my character reflect on me as a player?" and "Should I always uphold what I see as an ethical standard, regardless of whether it's in a fictional situation or not?"<br/><br/>As with most ethical question, the answer depends on where you're coming from. It also depends on who you're playing with and the reason for playing. That said, answering "yes" to the last question tends to lead to a something very dull, especially if it's the GMs point of view.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228233/#Comment_228233" name="Item_222" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T14:31:03+00:00" title="August 27, 2009  2:31PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2009 2:31PM by Tim_Gray.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Tulpa...how can a game all about lieing and self aggrandizement NOT be ethical in nature...</blockquote>\nIsn't the point of the game [Munchausen] that you take as read that this is how you will all interact?

Stories are a side effect of the advocacy of the persona in operation of the game mechanics (or system). If RPGs were games about directly creating stories, they'd be very different animals. And in creating a story -- authoring -- one is not confronted with the same kind of ethical questions. You're not identifying with a persona in crisis, under pressure, attempting to make a gut level decision that will benefit you the most but also allow you to sleep at night. Authoring a story -- fabricating a pure narrative -- allows a huge distance between author, audience and content. Playing an RPG has little or no such distance.<br/><br/>-Luke                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228296/#Comment_228296" name="Item_228" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T21:52:34+00:00" title="August 27, 2009  9:52PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2009 9:55PM by Levi Kornelsen.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timfire</cite>Someone mentioned that you don't make ethical decisions in<i>Super Mario</i>or<i>Star Craft</i>.

I don't feel that the terms "advocating" for a "persona" inherently distinguish between saying to the DM that my dwarf turns left at the forked corridor, and hitting keystrokes so that my dwarf turns left at the forked corridor.  That might be what you meant in your head, but the words down there don't unambiguously say that.  <br/><br/>Now, this could be dismissed as nitpicking.  After all, we all know what RPGs are, right?  So I'm just being stubborn when I suggest that something that we all know isn't really an RPG is an RPG.  But by that logic, redefining the term RPG in the first place is pointless.  I'm all for talking about the ethical implications of RPGs and how central ethical decisions are to different people when they're playing.  However, I'm against redefining a commonly-used term just to make a point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228309/#Comment_228309" name="Item_230" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T23:17:50+00:00" title="August 27, 2009 11:17PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2009 8:51PM by jhkim.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            EDIT: deleted accidental double post                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228312/#Comment_228312" name="Item_231" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T23:34:38+00:00" title="August 27, 2009 11:34PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mm.

Stories are a side effect of the advocacy of the persona in operation of the game mechanics (or system).</blockquote>\nThis is why I prefer the word "narrative". I included the word "story" in my earlier post because I thought it would help communicate my point, but I recognize that "story" carries certain connotations that don't map to all RPG play.<br/><br/>The point is that in creating an imaginary sequence of events and surrounding situation---this is what I mean by "narrative"---you are creating a context which gives meaning to the decisions/actions of the characters.<br/><br/>This is why something like a first-person shooter feels "non-ethical". As Vernon said, a FPS seems to match your definition, but certainly feels different. Again, the reason is that there is no <i>significant</i> (narrative) context to give meaning to the player's actions. Thus it just feels like you're pushing a game piece around a (visually sophisticated) game board.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>If RPGs were games about directly creating stories, they'd be very different animals. And in creating a story -- authoring -- one is not confronted with the same kind of ethical questions. You're not identifying with a persona in crisis, under pressure, attempting to make a gut level decision that will benefit you the most but also allow you to sleep at night. Authoring a story -- fabricating a pure narrative -- allows a huge distance between author, audience and content. Playing an RPG has little or no such distance.</blockquote>\nCom'on, personal identification with a character/persona is a totally separate issue, and in the big picture, independent of the role you're playing in the game.<br/><br/>Imagine we're playing, and I'm the GM and you're the player---I very well might identify more with your character (the protagonist) than I do with my own (the antagonistic villains). I might agonize over the situation, waiting to find out what type of action you're going take. And I might start taking actions not to benefit my own characters, but to instead build up the tension that will allow your character to flourish.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi-Who-Babbles.</cite>I think you mean "engaged in<b>creating</b>the story".<br/><br/>I'm very involved with the story of Final Fantasy X.  But I don't create that story.  Nor do I roleplay in any substantial way.</blockquote>\nWell.... mostly yes.<br/><br/>The bigger issue is that games like <i>Final Fantasy</i> don't connect the actions/decisions of the player to the greater story, thus the player's actions/decisions remain meaningless. But hypothetically speaking, even if the player can't effect the primary story line, I think it's possible for a game to set up a situation in such a way that the player's decisions feel "ethical". (Games like <i>Fable</i> *try* to do that, but not owning any of the current generation of video games consoles, I can't comment on how effective those types of games are.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi-Who-Babbles.</cite>I can spot a game that lets me be engaged in creating the story, and which allows me to roleplay... <b>  It's one that lets me make open-ended, substantial value decisions</b>, from the perspective of and on behalf of my persona. <i>[emphasis added]</i></blockquote>\nThis is kinda a side point, but I want to comment on it. I am thoroughly convinced that it's <b>quality</b> of choice, <b>not quantity</b>.<br/><br/>Here's a classic example:\n<blockquote>You're Peter Parker, aka Spiderman. You're walking down the street when the Green Goblin appears out of nowhere and explodes a bomb above your head. Debris starts to fall off a building onto a crowd of pedestrians. You see a huge chunk about to fall on, and presumably kill, Mary Jane and a small child.<br/><br/>You only have time to save one of them, who will it be?</blockquote>\nThat's not an open-ended question, it's a binary choice. But because I've taken the time to set up the (narrative) context, that simple, binary choice carries significant (ethical) weight.<br/><br/>(But if I had described it as <i>"a rock is going to kill one of these two random guys, do you save the guy on the right or the guy on the left"</i>, then the choice would have lost all of its meaning.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228349/#Comment_228349" name="Item_233" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-28T07:41:54+00:00" title="August 28, 2009  7:41AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FPS games don't have any true advocacy.

However, Luke's newly proposed definition of roleplaying game is <i>not</i> based on having roleplaying in it.  The definition doesn't reference role-playing or playing a role at all.  Furthermore, Valamir and others are explicitly making the case that the definition does not depend on the players or the characters questioning their ethics.  <br/><br/>This is one of the old borderline cases of RPGs.  For example, one can picture a one-GM/one-player Tunnels &amp; Trolls session where the PC wanders a dungeon and fights monsters.  Now, picture the same activity, except that instead of having a GM, the player uses one of the T&amp;T solo dungeon modules.  Are these examples of a fundamentally different activity?  As an optional third case, I might posit two kids just starting up with T&amp;T, and so one of them chooses to GM, but uses a solo dungeon book as his module. i.e. He talks the other kids through the solo dungeon.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>FPS games don't have any true advocacy.

I really can't tell what you're saying here, particular the sentence "he succeeds survives."  How do you judge whether advocacy has happened?

I asked Luke what he meant by this for much the same reason.  If by "advocate a persona," he only means "play a role" -- then it seems to me that it would be better to stick to "role-playing" as that is already in use and part of the term itself.  For "role-playing" or "persona-advocating," I think that the words on their own are insufficient.  I need clarification to know exactly what is meant.  For example, in my own definition of an RPG -- playing a role is explained as: <i>Hypothetically, a person watching the game looks over your shoulder and suggests a move, and your reply is "No, my character wouldn't do that." If this happens, or is capable of happening, then at some level you are playing a role-playing game.</i> <br/><br/>The usage of "advocating" to me implies that the player is genuinely trying his best (as a real person) to see that the persona achieves its goals.  I don't see that as a requirement.  That is, if someone is playing the role but not really trying their best to succeed, I'd still call that role-playing.  <br/><br/>I'm also not sure about the point of the latter part of the definition.  That is, what are games where the player advocates a persona, but the persona is not confronted with ethical choices?  It seems to me that the "confronted with one or more ethical choices" part of the definition serves no purpose, because any game that satisfies advocating a persona in Luke's sense will inherently have ethical choices.  <br/><br/>In general, it seems to me that this is pushing ethical choices as a way of distinguishing what RPGs are.  However, I feel that having ethical choices doesn't distinguish tabletop RPGs or LARPs from computer RPGs and interactive fiction.  For example, Lost in Austen is a choose-your-own adventure book where you play Elizabeth as she makes many decisions, many of which have clear ethical implications -- i.e. do you marry for love, or for the good of your family?  And as many people have pointed out, situations like war, combat, lying, violence, theft, etc. are all ethically-charged.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228563/#Comment_228563" name="Item_245" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T06:45:12+00:00" title="August 29, 2009  6:45AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>In general, it seems to me that this is pushing ethical choices as a way of distinguishing what RPGs are.

So...<br/>\n<br/>\nAn RPG is A game in which a player advocates the goals, priorities and survival (or doom) of a persona who, in operation of the game's mechanics, what defines that persona changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt can be tracked mechanically or not.  It can be physical stats, mental abilities or personal beliefs, ethics and relationships to other people (if that defines them), but it's more than just belongings(unless those define the persona).  That excludes things like monopoly, first person shooters, Donkey Kong and probably diplomacy though that might be debatable.  It includes things like mindless hack and slash D&amp;D;, computer rpg's, Dogs in the Vineyard, etc, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo why do I feel this is a more useful definition?

Without explicitly saying that every so often we arrive at an ethical choice (via these other properties) we allow the definition to drift into other games like Dungeon or Hack. <br/><br/>As we've been over a million times in this thread: 99% of CRPGs don't allow for true advocacy because your decisions don't change the outcome. The Lost in Austen book sounds interesting. The way you describe it, it sounds like a roleplaying game, but it depends on how much actual freedom the player has to advocate her character's path. If you make all those choices in service of just one or two outcomes, then perhaps it's another game. If the ethical decisions open up other paths and outcomes, then it sounds like a roleplaying game.<br/><br/>That's the beauty of RPGs, that gut-wrenching decision can often turn the game on its ear and present a whole new path to explore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228583/#Comment_228583" name="Item_250" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T09:46:06+00:00" title="August 29, 2009  9:46AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2009 9:49AM by jhkim.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            EDIT: (cross-posted with Luke's post directly above)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>In general, I think those things are all RPGs (or can be played as RPGs). I think Luke agreed with me on that matter in an earlier post.<br/><br/>Are you trying to define "RPG" or "Tabletop RPG"?</blockquote>\nPersonally, I was trying to define "RPG."  Under my own definition, I think the distinction is that in many games -- including first-person shooter (FPS) computer games and choose-your-own adventure (CYOA) books -- there are often choices made with ethical implications.  However, most people do not make these choices by thinking about what their character would do in such a situation and thus they are not role-playing game -- although technically speaking they could be played as RPGs.  That thinking as the character is the center of my own definition.  <br/><br/>Now, Luke made clear before that he didn't think FPS's could be RPGs under his definition because they don't have true advocacy.  I don't know exactly how he defines that, though, and I asked for clarification.  If Luke's definition of "advocating a persona" is identical to my view of "role-playing," then our definitions are the same except that his has the qualifier about ethics.  It seems to me that the ethics qualifier is extraneous.  I can't picture what would be a game that has true advocacy and yet no ethical choices given the broad definition of ethical choices expressed.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite><cite>Posted By: Tim Gray</cite>Is roleplaying/advocating a persona necessarily something that needs an audience, or does it count if I'm muttering away to myself with an in-character commentary while playing WoW or something?</blockquote>\nWhen I play my paladin in WoW, and I refuse to kill bunnies and other small, helpless animals, it certain feels like role-playing, even when there's no other player around. It's a game. I am role-playing. I'd say it's a role-playing game.<br/>In the context of my definition for RPGs, I would agree with Adam.  Roleplaying does not inherently need an audience, and his experience of WoW was role-playing.  However, I would say that people who play WoW without considering such issues (possibly a majority of WoW players) may not be playing a role-playing game.  In the same way, one may use tabletop RPG mechanics to run purely tactical wargames.  I feel that the degree to which you questioned killing bunnies matters to whether it is an RPG.  As far as I can tell, under Luke's definition -- even if you did choose to kill bunnies, the existence of that choice meant that there was ethical choice in the game.  However, what you were doing may or may not have been advocacy.  (I'm still not clear on his intended definition of advocacy in this context.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>As we've been over a million times in this thread: 99% of CRPGs don't allow for true advocacy because your decisions don't change the outcome. The Lost in Austen book sounds interesting. The way you describe it, it sounds like a roleplaying game, but it depends on how much actual freedom the player has to advocate her character's path. If you make all those choices in service of just one or two outcomes, then perhaps it's another game. If the ethical decisions open up other paths and outcomes, then it sounds like a roleplaying game.<br/><br/>That's the beauty of RPGs, that gut-wrenching decision can often turn the game on its ear and present a whole new path to explore.</blockquote>\nInteresting.  I brought up Lost in Austen mainly because it was the CYOA book that I had most recently played, not because I felt it was an exception to the rule.  I don't play many computer games, but my experience is that many have at least as much branching as Lost in Austen.  The most direct parallel is Infocom and later text-based interactive fiction, but I think there's a fair number of possible endings in other games as well.  My limited experience was that there are a lot of very important decisions in CRPGs, including many life-or-death ones.  That is, presented with an ethical decision, I as player have a choice that could lead to death and tragedy or could lead to a happy ending.  Now, I heard there was a trend of computer RPGs with more linear story using video clips.  However, the recent trend seems to be more on rendered 3D models allowing many outcomes.  <br/><br/>I do think that a human GM can provide a flexibility in dealing with unpredicted actions that a computer can't possibly match.  However, in my experience it is easily possible to go through a dungeon module without taking any actions that a computer couldn't deal with reasonably.  Thus, that flexibility isn't inherently what distinguishes a computer RPG and a tabletop one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228598/#Comment_228598" name="Item_252" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T12:51:15+00:00" title="August 29, 2009 12:51PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, in my albeit limited experience designing CRPGs, there is no true creative choice possible for the player.

I definitely agree that all computer-moderated games are locked into a short list of pre-written options, and that human-moderated RPGs have the potential for creative / improvised / unanticipated outcomes.  I'll be concrete about what we're talking about here.  I'm picturing on the one hand, I could DM a first-generation module like maybe White Plume Mountain.  I could DM it for five different groups of players.  Alternatively, I could play an interactive fiction text adventure five times.  I could also play a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book like Lost in Austen.  How would these differ in practice?  <br/><br/>I would argue that the tabletop sessions might well not have completely unanticipated endings.  Chances are good that White Plume Mountain will end the same way in terms of general plotline.  The party is leaving the dungeon carrying the 1 to 3 of the artifacts that they went in for.  It is fairly common for RPG adventures to be even more linear than this, especially in later generations.  For example, many tournament modules would put the collection of the artifacts in a pre-specified order.  I think we're all aware that there is a significant subset of modules and GM-directed play that is criticized as being railroaded.  <br/><br/>Lost in Austen doesn't have creative improvisation.  It's still a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book.  For example, in one branching you might decide to marry for the good of your family, and the result is that you suffer through years of a loveless marriage until you accidentally kill your husband in a fight and are taken to prison.  That can be considered a clear failure, and you will go back to a previous point in the book and keep going.  However, I think that have that failure result and re-starting is not the same thing as not having any choices.  The whole point of the game is that you can make choices and see the consequences of those choices.  It is different from a tabletop RPG in that it is much easier to restart.  The ability to back up or restart is common in computer and CYOA games, but rare to non-existent in tabletop RPGs or LARPs.  This diminishes the impact of failure and/or death, but it allows much more exploration of life-and-death choices, which I think is useful to a game about ethical choice.  (As a side note, another difference among these is that Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books sometimes multiple happy endings, whereas many computer games and RPG modules have only one successful outcome.)  I would argue that the choices leading to failure means that Lost in Austen does have a component ethical choice.  Ethical choice doesn't require unforeseen options.  Indeed, many ethical dilemmas are phrased as picking one of two options.  Lost in Austen and many other interactive fiction works are about ethical choice, but they are not role-playing games as I see them.  <br/><br/>I realize now that you mean for the term "advocacy" to imply that there must be creative improvisation beyond picking among fixed options, but I don' t think that's inherent in the phrase.  I'm also not so sure that this sense of it applies to playing in a railroaded RPG session or a dungeon with limited choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228654/#Comment_228654" name="Item_254" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-29T22:41:37+00:00" title="August 29, 2009 10:41PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't believe I'm arguing with you about games you don't really play.<br/><br/>Okay.

I picked White Plume Mountain as an example because it's a module that I have played  multiple times in the past, and in my experience it was fairly cut and dried.  I never saw any of your options in play.  There were a lot of chips eaten, a lot of soda quaffed, a lot of jokes made, and some witty banter while solving puzzles and fighting monsters.  However, in the end the plot came out about the same.  <br/><br/>Now, you could say that it was the <i>potential</i> to come up with such options that made it an RPG.  I don't see how unused potential can define the experience, though.  i.e. We played through it following the expected plot.  Does it fundamentally change what we did (i.e. RPG or not) whether the DM would have allowed such options?  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>In order for all of the stars to align for an RPG, one must have more than just operation of a game's mechanics in service of a persona.

It sounds like you're saying that someone has to be a special unique snowflake to be meaningful -- i.e. if their answer to the ethical question is something that could have been predicted, then it's meaningless.  <br/><br/>Let me be a little more concrete.  Suppose I'm rewriting the module.  I and some friends come up and brainstorm for a few hours about what players might do in the encounter with Quesnef.  We run a few playtests and see what those players do.  So the final module has notes for the GM listing a bunch of options and the suggested consequences of each.  <br/><br/>Now, obvious there may be some possibilities that we didn't think of.  But the question is: Suppose a bunch of people play it and come up with things that we had thought of in advance.  Does this mean that their choice was meaningless, because it was within the limited options that we had prepared for?  I'd tend to say no.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228817/#Comment_228817" name="Item_256" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-30T22:18:02+00:00" title="August 30, 2009 10:18PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>Now, you could say that it was the<i>potential</i>to come up with such options that made it an RPG.
