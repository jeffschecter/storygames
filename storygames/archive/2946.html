And yet we should, because obviously some people are going to be much better than others when writing background material in a short period of time.

Obviously there are plenty of games on the market with tons of background and setting material that are top-notch. When you have a two-week window, however, I think it's essentially impossible to do a, say, 60-page game any justice. The writing is going to suffer some purely on the force of the time constraint. So, for me, it's not that the length per se is a problem; it's that the length given the time constraint correlates pretty strongly with writing issues.<br/><br/>That being said, I will say that the other finalists are really pretty damn amazing and, generally speaking, very well written.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66820/#Comment_66820" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-03T16:16:04+00:00" title="May  3, 2007  4:16PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2007 4:23PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: talysman</cite>if you kept the flavor text in either of those games the same, but substituted the rules for, say, Rolemaster, would you still say that it was a good game design?

So the obvious answer to your question is: "no, it's a worse game design than without the DitV/Polaris background." <br/><br/>To answer a different question, it seems clear to me that DitV is a worse game design if you take out all the background, yes. And vastly worse if you replace it with Rolemaster's background text. The difference between your question and the one I was thinking of is which element you consider primary and which complementary, I guess, but it doesn't really matter, since all you need to do is establish that they have an effect on one another. You seem to be suggesting that flavour text must somehow make game design better <i>intrinsically</i>, without any thought to context. That doesn't make any sense at all, and is not what I meant to suggest.<br/><br/>I think good flavour text and background can make a game design better, and bad flavour text and background can make it worse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66823/#Comment_66823" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-03T16:31:39+00:00" title="May  3, 2007  4:31PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2007 4:37PM by Graham.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bloody hell, I only posted this an hour ago and it's gone on to a whole different argument.

I can't see how you could claim the flavor text part of a game <em>product</em> makes the game <em>design</em> better. Well-written flavor text gives the reader a standard to create a specific experience, using the rules. But it's not the game. It's decorative, like artwork. And as for background... it inspires the game design, true, but the fact that people have played DitV and Polaris using entirely different backgrounds means that the background is not part of the game design.</p>\n<p>But all of this is not only derailing the thread, it's missing my point. There's a difference between the final game product and the initial game design. When you first design a game, your flavor text and background should be minimal and sketchy; you fill that in later, when you know the rules work. And you may even hire someone else to write that part.</p>\n<p>The problem with Game Chef games being too long is that people are spending too much time writing game books instead of designing an actual game within that two weeks time. And it's not just flavor text and background; I read one game that went on for several pages describing how to decorate the room you play in for maximum impact, and several games that had a "what is role-playing?" section. It's a game design challenge judged by game designers; I think we all know how to role-play, without being told "it's like cowboys and indians".</p>\n<p>What I would like to do for this "Game Chef Entrees" challenge I'm suggesting is limit flavor text to <em>one page</em>, and require rules to be described as an outline, or as a procedure. Additional background material would be sketchy and would only occur in one- or two-sentence descriptions forspells, skills, classes, or equipment in a list. Create the seed of an RPG, not an entire first draft. I want to test some things, but I'm thinking of a five-page maximum. Imagine how much easier it would be to read and judge <em>that</em>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66825/#Comment_66825" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-03T16:41:02+00:00" title="May  3, 2007  4:41PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2007 4:41PM by Graham.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.

And I wanted to do more, but the length issue was a problem. We had five required reviews, plus four reviews done in sequence, beginning with the first entry after our own submission. As luck would have it, most of those were at least 30 pages, and one was 110+ pages (although I think it really could have been condensed to 45.) So, although your game was on my list of games to review, Graham, I didn't get to it, because I ran out of time.</p>\n<p>I was fair.

It is a trade off and decision to be made in the contest like any other (like: how much time do I spend formatting a document to look good? how much background information should I write? do I have time to put examples in?). There is a similar risk in writing a shorter game, namely that you will be unable to fully elaborate and explain all of your concepts and leave the reader feeling confused.<br/><br/>Now, if you wrote a long game AND left the reader feeling confused *looks nervously at his own game* then you have probably gone in the wrong design direction <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66901/#Comment_66901" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-04T09:57:34+00:00" title="May  4, 2007  9:57AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hey Adam, there's this thing that Jon and I have batted around, the game-chefish game.

Taking points off because the game is long and bored you to tears is no different, in my mind, than taking points off because you dislike games which don't have unified mechanics or ranking something low because it included monkeys!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66905/#Comment_66905" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-04T10:27:19+00:00" title="May  4, 2007 10:27AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>Ryan, you know that thread I posted about, uh, essentially the conflict between following the rules-as-written and treating your fellow participants as humans?The rules do not mandate it, but I think that the human treatment of others requires that we consider that other humans may have attention and time constraints, and <em>that</em> means that, if you have an idea that would be great in 50 pages but limp in 15, <em>get a different idea.</em></blockquote>\nSaying "Dude, your game gave my cat some strange disease and you're a blight on the world of gaming" is something I think we can all agree ("for the most part," he says, covering his ass) is an example of not treating your fellow participants with basic decency.  But leaping from that to the idea that publishing a 50 page game is treating your fellow participants as sub-human (point of note: I didn't use the phrase "as humans" first) is just ludicrous.  That's some seriously hostile, loaded language there, Shreyas.  I wrote a 30-page game that apparently wasn't clear to read; did I treat those who read my game as something less than human?  That certainly wasn't my intent, and I don't believe I did.<br/><br/>This gets into "Shreyas's unwritten rules of Game Chef."  If you want people to share that vision, maybe next year you should post up at the start of the contest something about what you think people should do.  Or leave them unsaid and complain that people are demeaning their fellow humans because they're writing long documents or having ideas you think they shouldn't try in Game Chef.<br/><br/>Speaking of "getting a new idea," how do I know right away if my game will need 15 or 50 pages?  I certainly don't until I'm part-way through the process, and at that point I'm too invested and my mind is focused on that game too much to shift gears and try <em>another</em> idea that may or may not be shorter.  Maybe those who have done Game Chef year after year have the advantage of knowing how long their idea will end up being, but those of us who are entering this for the first or second time don't have that advantage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pigeon" title="pigeon"><img alt="pigeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pigeon">pigeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66914/#Comment_66914" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-04T11:04:10+00:00" title="May  4, 2007 11:04AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Shreyas is being a dick and trying to push people around based on their post count.

Not because it's so accusatory, but because I'm sure people who wrote longer games weren't doing it to be inconsiderate. Most of the people writing longer games were first-timers. They didn't <em>know</em>. I saw some light-bulbs go off when it came time for them to review other people's games. And I saw some other people realize "Hey, maybe I won't get as detailed feedback on my game because reviewers will be looking at the big picture instead of tiny details."</p>\n<p>There's something to be said for that approach. In contrast to my other idea, try running a game competition with a 50 page <em>minimum</em>. Decrease the allotted review time. Require each reviewer to name five things that need to be changed in some way (more of this! less of that!) With 200+ pages to read, reviewers will have to skim the flavor and go right for the stuff that sticks out, good or bad.</p>\n<p>Or don't address page length at all, just decrease the design time and increase the number of required peer reviews.

Well, actually, printing out the first five pages isn't such a great idea, because that'll just be the flavour text. But I like the spirit of it. I can skim the PDF and see if it grabs me.<br/><br/>I personally agree with Shreyas, that, if a game can't be condensed to less than 20 pages, there's something wrong with it.

At that stage, I'd reviewed all my compulsory games and could review what I wanted. Guy Shalev suggested I read Meuin, because, at the time, it hadn't had many reviews.<br/><br/>So I printed it out and read it. Now, given what I wrote above, you won't be surprised that the flavour text put me off. That's fine: you like the flavour text, I don't, it's a personal preference <br/><br/>Nevertheless, I tried to review it. I really tried. But I didn't have the time to do it well. To give a game a fair review, I like to read it once, making notes; read it again; then sit at the computer, flicking through the game, writing the review. But Meuin was 84 pages. I just couldn't do it: or, at least, I couldn't do it in the detail I wanted. So I gave up and reviewed a shorter game instead.<br/><br/>So, yes, Meuin is a concrete example of a game I wanted to review, but didn't, because of its length.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67001/#Comment_67001" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-06T10:02:46+00:00" title="May  6, 2007 10:02AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>To give a game a fair review, I like to read it once, making notes; read it again; then sit at the computer, flicking through the game, writing the review.

Nothing unknown to us there - we just have to keep in mind that this is already part of the contest: with no rule forcing us to tackle every entry, we'll naturally let those that are long, or awkward, or actively unattractive fall by the wayside as we use up our review time. So longer games have more to overcome, more to live up to by default.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, with IF reading and playing are the same thing, and such an attempt can be completely derailed by a bug in the coding, but the same principles should hold...<br/>\n<br/>\n(Opps - looks like i cannot find that review of IFcomp's trends after all...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67022/#Comment_67022" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-06T15:57:20+00:00" title="May  6, 2007  3:57PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Kynn,<br/><br/>most people define flavour text as bits of fiction.

Flavor text as fiction can quite readily be advice, examples, and background/setting, rather than useless fluff.

mostly-dead GC forum, I am trying to start up some discussion around the top 8 games, since I figure there are a fair number of people out there currently reading over these games. So far I've only started on Schizonauts and The Weaver's Daughter -- the two longest games, strangely enough -- but I'm hoping to try and find some stuff to talk about in all of them. I'm trying to avoid a 'review' style in favour of concentrating on one or two issues that might spark actual discussion, analysis &amp; interpretation of the games.<br/><br/>I might try it with Graham's game too just because he was rightfully disappointed in the review mojo turned in his direction. I don't like the way it feels like I'm targetting/preferring the top 8 (especially since I stand to benefit from it), but to be honest it seems like there's a clear opportunity there: people who want to vote are already reading these games, and actual conversation is probably going to be more productive than just another review.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67062/#Comment_67062" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T06:11:47+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  6:11AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To go back to the O.P., since I missed this one until today...\n<blockquote>I'm really sick of printing out 45 page documents.<br/><br/>And then I had a mischevious idea. I probably won't vote for these games anyway. They'll have loads of flavour text I'll hate. I like short games. Basically, I feel that anyone writing over 30 pages should have been more concise.<br/><br/>So I might just print out the short ones. Anything under 20 pages. OK, Home Sweet Home is 25, maybe that too.<br/><br/>Is that bad?</blockquote>\nResponding as one of those guys whose game is many pages ...<br/><br/>On a personal level (by which I mean, responding solely emotionally), you'd make me really disappointed in you, but hey, I don't expect you to change your behavior just because I might be a little sad for a while -- and I can at least give you the reassurance that my disappointment will only last as long as my memory, and my memory is pretty shitty.<br/><br/>Outside of that stuff, though, let me say this.  My game is long because I believe in being clear.  I believe in giving you enough examples to understand what my rules are trying to do.  I believe in giving you a healthy-sized designer's notes section at the end (which you can skip unless you really enjoy that sort of thing).  I believe that if I gave you a shorter game, I would be doing you a disservice.  <br/><br/>If you'd like a worse, shorter game, mine could probably be cut down to about ten to fifteen pages of mostly bullet points.  Instead, I chose to treat you like a person who reads things rather than a machine that processes rubrics.  I like writing games for people, though, so it's not very likely to play out that way now or in the future. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>And a bullshit (by which i mean, inconsequential) footnote: If you really have a problem printing out 45 pages, don't.  Your PDF viewer has plenty of options for printing more than one page to a page. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2946/game-chef-final-maybe-ill-just-read-the-short-games" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2946/game-chef-final-maybe-ill-just-read-the-short-games" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2946/game-chef-final-maybe-ill-just-read-the-short-games/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2946%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F2946%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
