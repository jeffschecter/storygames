My own games <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/2008/07/23/zombie-cinema-rules-critique/" rel="nofollow">Zombie Cinema</a> and <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/fables-of-camelot/" rel="nofollow">Fables of Camelot</a> are very gameable in these conditions, I find in consequence.

I recommend <a href="http://www.tao-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DeedsAndDoers.pdf" rel="nofollow">Deeds &amp; Doers</a> as a very convention-fit take on the subject matter, although it does presume prior familiarity with the genre.<br/><br/>Going at it more generally, the field is vast and full of options. I might recommend <i>Kagematsu</i> as a particular highlight, insofar as my own tastes go. Also,<br/><i>Dead of Night</i><br/><i>Dreaming Crucible</i><br/><i>Drifter's Escape</i><br/><i>It Was a Mutual Decision</i><br/><i>Maid</i><br/><i>Mars Colony</i><br/><i>Microscope</i><br/><i>Mist-Robed Gate</i><br/><i>Orx</i><br/><i>S/lay w/ Me</i><br/><i>Society of Dreamers</i><br/><i>Sons of Liberty</i><br/><i>The Dance and the Dawn</i><br/>are all delightful and interesting games that fit your parameters naturally; I would recommend any one of them, provided the subject matter entices.

It allows people to each individually pursue their own theme/style without forcing them to get along in a "party."  And it still has enough crosses and face-offs to make it a coherent story.  Also, someone has already hacked it for "Remember Edo" here on s-g, to prove just how painless hacking the system is.<br/><br/>Itras By works pretty well at conventions because it's all meant to be surreal, so it's very forgiving of strangers trying to play together.  Everyone at the table gets to inject a Chance card once per session, and they all will get the opportunity to resolve each-other's outcomes, so everyone can stay engaged.  (The rules for Itras are really short, but there's a ton of [really beautiful] setting and tone that you could skip if you don't have the time.)<br/>[You'd also have to print some cards up]<br/><br/>Second MistRobed Gate, for sure, but it does more or less require a knife and a table you can stab.  If you do, take a big posterboard to r-map on.  It helps the set-up phase immensely.  Good news is it can take a dozen people pretty easily.<br/><br/>Maid is awesome for players who like random tables full of random.  It's like Kobolds Ate My Baby, but with maids and ninjas an stuff.<br/><br/>Zombie Cinema is really sweet for con play as well, as it plays like a movie, and again, the players don't have to be forced in to a "typical" party structure.  The game rules will give a clear feedback loop for who might be close to dying, who will be sold out to save someone else's skin, etc.  And dead players get to play zombies and ratchet up the tension.<br/>[You'd have to print a game board, just a few cards, and find a few colored pawns.]<br/><br/>CAROLINA DEATH CRAWL is super fun, plays surprisingly quickly, and has some really clever mechanics to feedback tone and reincorporate player input.  You might have to cut out some (print and play) cards if you can't get a hold of a deck.  I think the rules for free on bullypilpitgames so you can preview it, but man, it's a game you just have to play to really see how cool it flows.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425616/#Comment_425616" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-10T07:15:17+00:00" title="December 10, 2013  7:15AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But if you want my favorite, Kagematsu.<br/><br/>I've hacked it for other settings, but in the default, it's about a desperate village and a wandering swordsman.  He is their only hope, for all the men have died in war.  So the players all take the role of village women, who must gain affections from him and convince him to face the Threat that hangs over them all.<br/><br/>The twist?<br/><br/>The (male) ronin must be played by someone who identifies as female.  It plays at tragedy, desperation, hope, love, duty, all the while highlighting our own presuppositions about gender and gender-roles.  There are a few rules that (I think) need a bit more emphasis in the rules, but all in all, it's tightly focused, the power structure is amazingly well thought out, and it has some real potential even with complete strangers (perhaps even more so.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425618/#Comment_425618" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-10T07:37:09+00:00" title="December 10, 2013  7:37AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good suggestions all.

I've run it at cons a half a dozen times. Pretty sure there's a PDF version out there.<br/><br/>[EDIT] I realize I didn't sell it. So in Misspent Youth you play disaffected teens who fight The Man and change a crumbling dystopian world. World creation is part of play (collaborative) and takes maybe 30 minutes. The GM's role is mainly pacing and "playing the world," but all the conflict resolution stuff is out of the GM's hands (completely system-based). GM doesn't even roll dice. The rules provide a scene structure that mirrors the rising and falling tension of a typical story.<br/><br/>The coolest part of the game is that the PCs have tags that represent the power of their youth, and when they're losing a conflict, they can "sell out" that trait to its jaded, adult version. For example, "cool" becomes "trendy."                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425621/#Comment_425621" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-10T08:18:46+00:00" title="December 10, 2013  8:18AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3441990/archipelago_third_edition.pdf" rel="nofollow">Archipelago </a>works well as a one shot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425624/#Comment_425624" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-10T09:32:11+00:00" title="December 10, 2013  9:32AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love In a Wicked Age for this.

I'll shill for them because I have no shame (being a bloody immigrant and all).<br/><br/>You want to try <a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/witch/" rel="nofollow">Witch: The Road to Lindisfarne</a> and <a href="http://ukrpdc.wordpress.com/pcd/marquis-of-ferrara/" rel="nofollow">Marquis of Ferrara</a>, both by Pompey Crew Design, now a part of UKRP Design Collective.<br/><br/>Both are GMless, both have an act-based structure, and when played by 4-5 players both fit into a standard con slot very well. They are greatly replayable while also providing a full setup of a tense situation (characters, in some cases suggested relationships, a starting situation and, in some cases, extra kickers during the story). Both are also short to read and can be run in a no-prep way, entirely from the leaflet/booklet if you have it with you. There are extra materials for both available on the internet - check them out to get an idea of what the games look like.<br/><br/>As for the mood/story: Marquis of Ferrara is swashbuckling/politicking in renaissance Italy, whereas Witch more sombre, a drama played out during a journey where a woman blamed for an outbreak of the plague is ferried by a couple of people from different walks of life towards a final destination, when she will be burned. If you let it happen.<br/><br/>By the way, Witch is inspired by <a href="http://thoughtfulgames.com/montsegur1244/" rel="nofollow">Montsegur 1244</a> but plays quicker, because it has less characters. If you do have a longish slot available, you can try Montsegur. It's my favourite of all three, but it's also the one which is most likely to cut emotionally, and needs to be played with mature players. It's about a fall of a besieged Cathar castle: you play knowing that by the end you will most likely have to either sell out (recant) or die in a horrible way (burn). It takes longer to play because iirc there are 12 characters altogether, so it takes longer to explore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425667/#Comment_425667" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-11T10:41:52+00:00" title="December 11, 2013 10:41AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.memento-mori.com/lacuna/" rel="nofollow">Lacuna, The Creation of the Mystery and the Girl from Blue City</a> works really well as a one shot, especially for people who've never played it before \u2014 and even works well for newbie gamers.

Each player character is given a chance to get what he/she wants - at a price.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=99256" rel="nofollow">http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=99256</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans" title="Hans"><img alt="Hans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans">Hans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425684/#Comment_425684" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-11T13:48:45+00:00" title="December 11, 2013  1:48PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Dust Devils might count as "old-school" with respect to indie role-playing, but it's the single best one-shot game I have ever played.   <br/><br/><a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/83481/Dust-Devils" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/83481/Dust-Devils</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425701/#Comment_425701" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-12T01:22:12+00:00" title="December 12, 2013  1:22AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd put another vote in for Witch (only reason I didn't suggest it earlier was that it isn't free).
