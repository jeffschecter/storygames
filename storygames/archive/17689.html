The use of magic in public is punishable by death - there are no exceptions. Those who would risk exposing the community of magic-users must be dealt with swiftly. Jack Tennyson, Madeleine Khaw, Alexander Dabila, and Marcus Fax must die. The problem? Other than having an order out for their deaths, the four of them have no idea who the Coven are or any clue that there are others out there with magical abilities. Unfortunately for them, none of that matters to the Finders who have been sent to carry out the Coven\u2019s decree. So it is with a grim fascination that the four have found themselves bound to chairs in an abandoned warehouse as they await their executions. Their captors will return any moment. What will they do?</i><br/>-<b>Introduction from The Legerdemain Betrayers</b></blockquote></div><br/><br/>Hey fellow StoryGamers,<br/><br/>I have completed work on my second game, The Legerdemain Betrayers, and wanted you all to be the first to know. When I announced my first game's release (God-king) here back in April, I mentioned how the Story Games community has given me a lot interesting stuff to read instead of do work and that's still true. I have found a lot of motivation to create games just from reading all of the different discussions that take place here so I would really like to thank you all for providing such great content and being a great community.<br/><br/>I would love to hear any feedback you all might have for the game should you try it out. I would write more, but I've been up for over 24 hours preparing the game for release so I'm a bit at a loss for words, currently. If you have any questions about the game, please feel free to ask them here or, if you prefer, you can shoot me an email at danielcruzchan@gmail.com<br/><br/>You can check out The Legerdemain Betrayers at <a href="http://spiffup.org/betrayers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://spiffup.org/betrayers</a> It is currently on sale for $2.99 for the first week. It is a 42 page, full-color, PDF, immediate download.<br/><br/>Thanks for your time,<br/>-Daniel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400630/#Comment_400630" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-12T17:59:55+00:00" title="December 12, 2012  5:59PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sold!

The original version of The Legerdemain Betrayers is actually a Harry Potter-themed online game of that sort. It was about the Ministry of Magic going after this small group of wizards and witches who had banded together thinking they were the only people in the world with magical abilities. Another funny thing about that is the game used a system the group helped to created called "Wands". The core concept is still in there - outsiders to a magic-using community on the run - but the game is much different now. Not to mention the mechanics are completely different.<br/><br/>Speaking of the mechanics, the game's playing card-based system has evolved quite a bit from the way it originally worked. My first game release, God-king, actually started out as an exercise in trying to improve upon the system used in Betrayers'. That little offshoot project turned into something completely different when the concept of God-king kind of organically formed from the mechanics - the system used in Betrayers is very different from the one in God-king. In terms of creation, God-king is chronologically the second game I have created. <br/><br/>In the end, the system used in The Legerdemain Betrayers was inspired by card magic, Magic: The Gathering (of course), and, interestingly enough, fighting games. One of the core mechanics in Betrayers was directly inspired by a common mechanic in fighting games where you gain the ability to do special moves when you build up your "special meter" by successfully performing normal moves. The opposite mechanic is also in the game - an Ultra move that is built up by taking hits - in Betrayers this happens when you fail conflicts. <br/><br/>None of this is strictly relevant to enjoying the game, but hopefully you all might enjoy some tidbits of Betrayers' design history. I am very happy to finally get this concept out there as it got its start way back in 2008 and has seen quite a lot of changes since that time.<br/><br/>Thanks for listening to me ramble a bit!<br/>-Daniel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian" title="Zelbinian"><img alt="Zelbinian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/056/nMYJBWP65457Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian">Zelbinian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400733/#Comment_400733" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-13T17:37:37+00:00" title="December 13, 2012  5:37PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>A deck of cards.<br/>Magicians.<br/>Urban fantasy.<br/>MAGICIANS.<br/>3 bucks.<br/><br/>Sold.</blockquote>\nDitto.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400768/#Comment_400768" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-13T23:40:18+00:00" title="December 13, 2012 11:40PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After a quick first read, I'd say this is a really cool setup for a one-shot or short campaign.

If I'm buying something that's not a physical object, it's nice for it to at least have some onscreen aesthetic value beyond the pure text.<br/><br/>(However, speaking of pure text, I noticed a glitch on page 16: the second sentence in the right column calls the same player both "he" and "she".

Using magic once is dangerous enough, but a character who wields such abilities repeatedly will succumb to severe ramifications.</blockquote>I don't see any reflection of this in the mechanics; the side effects are just dependent on the number of mismatching cards in the hand.

Book design is actually something I wish I could do more often so these games are a great outlet for that purpose. I definitely agree that having something that's nice to look at helps to enhance the experience.<br/><br/>Also, thanks for finding those errors! I have just sent out an email to everyone who has ordered the game with information about how to obtain the corrected PDF. <br/><br/>As for the worsening side effects that result from the overuse of magic: yes the Narrator just keeps track of how many times a character has used his or her magical abilities and then ups the ante. The more severe effects are mainly meant to affect those who perform magic multiple times within a short time span.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
