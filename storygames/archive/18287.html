I'd love to hear some Story Games opinions! What do you think about this design process when you make games? Do you utilize these types of techniques? Do you find valuable correlations between visual design and game design? What are they?<br/><br/><a href="http://www.gamingaswomen.com/posts/2013/04/micro-games-as-a-game-design-experiment/" rel="nofollow">Micro Games as a Game Design Experiment</a><br/><br/><i>"Learning how to reduce your design to it\u2019s essentials, and do it well, is one of the most challenging lessons for creators. I approach design primarily as a visual artist, so I reminisce about design classes meant to teach specific techniques. Form, repetition, pattern, color, proportion; these are every artist\u2019s arsenal. But where is the design class to teach specific game design techniques? Mechanics, narrative, player agency, tone. While we all know these are parts of a roleplaying game design, it\u2019s often hard to break a game down to it\u2019s most essential design parts. What those parts are, and how they function, varies from designer to designer."</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412271/#Comment_412271" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-19T08:40:00+00:00" title="April 19, 2013  8:40AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2013 8:43AM by Rickard.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, was it you who wrote that excellent article?<br/><br/>I really enjoy designing micro games, in the small amount I've actually done it, because it forces me to break how roleplaying games work (or could work) into it's basic foundation.

"<a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/129622/love-letter" rel="nofollow">Love Letter</a>" and "<a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131357/coup" rel="nofollow">Coup</a>" consist entirely of tiny decks of cards and a few tokens. "<a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/129622/love-letter" rel="nofollow">Love Letter</a>" uses a 16-card deck with only 8 unique cards, and "Coup" goes even further with only 5 unique cards but wrings more complexity out of them. The rules can be expressed on the cards themselves plus a little cheat-sheet. I've got "Love Letter" and it's lightweight but a lot of fun; I just ordered "Coup" yesterday.<br/><br/>(Daniel Solis has also been experimenting with prototypes of a <a href="http://danielsolisblog.blogspot.com/2013/02/suspense-card-game.html" rel="nofollow">slightly similar 13-card game</a> currently called "Suspense".)<br/><br/>"Love Letter" and "Coup" get a lot of mileage out of secret roles, where you're trying to deduce what rank or abilities the other players secretly hold, by 'reading' their behavior. (The older card game "Citadels" does this too.) This might be an interesting idea for a more RPG/freeform game too \u2014 I don't think RPGs have done enough with hidden information, probably because it gets awkward to share knowledge with the GM but not other players. GM-less games might fare better with this.<br/><br/>(On a tangent: part of what interests me about these games is that they seem to bring out people's DIY tendencies. With so few components it's easy to make your own, and to redesign the theme \u2014 kind of like the way everyone gets inspired to redo Lady Blackbird. There are literally about 50 homemade Love Letter rethemes already, ranging from Adventure Time to Game Of Thrones to the Sopranos. I'm working on a Coup retheme based on Jim Woodring's "Frank" comics, even before my official copy arrives in the mail\u2026)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412281/#Comment_412281" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-19T12:14:08+00:00" title="April 19, 2013 12:14PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> wow thanks for the compliment. <br/><br/>I like the parts you've described.

We are overflowing with smart people saying smart things about what good RPG rules need to do, but I've seen very little discussion about <i>how to create</i> the rules that do that.<br/><br/>Some people have mentioned using diagrams, though I've never seen one.  Kira, as an artist/designer, have you ever tried diagramming out your rules ideas?  Every time I try a user flow chart I just make a mess.<br/><br/>As for the micro idea, it seems to me that "make a tiny game for a contest" usually produces stuff that's over-simple, over-focused, half-baked, incomplete, or all of the above.  (I still enjoy this and find it valuable!  It produces awesome concepts and techniques galore!  But complete games?  I haven't seen much of that, and I've never pulled it off myself.)  On the other hand, starting with a full game and <i>then</i> reducing it down to its bare essentials -- that does sound cool.  I know I've been removing D&amp;D leftovers from my fantasy game for years!  Actively trying to excise everything I could might have saved me some time and helped me identify the game's core.<br/><br/>I'm still not sure how to simplify early in the process, though.

I think anyone can have the capacity to invent processes to make a game work, provided the game is clear about what needs to be created.

The level of commitment is so low for a game of that length that most people would be willing to give it a shot. And, like a couple people have said, you are forced to build the game out of behaviors that people mostly already know how to do. And, honestly, incorporating more of the normal behaviors of our lives into game design (rather than trying to teach people a completely different set of behaviors that are only useful in RPGs) is pretty radical and experimental in itself. "You already know how to do this; we're just arranging the pieces in a new way" is a pretty radical and amazing message, because it means that everyone can play and everyone can design (especially at a short length!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412811/#Comment_412811" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-26T16:05:36+00:00" title="April 26, 2013  4:05PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Micro rules are a great thing.

Complexity of fictional situation, whether initially or as it develops through linked return play can fulfill that urge as well.<br/><br/>Certainly RPGs, drawing from the model set up first by D&amp;D, having long-term linked return play as a core concept tend towards mechanical complexity and subsystems and set up an expectation among hobbyists that those things will exist.<br/><br/>WRT those 1970s minis rules, context is important. Those 3"x 5" card rules would be cheatsheet charts, the game would likely be a presentation game in a convention style context ( if not actually at a convention), the person who cooked them up would likely also be the referee, and most people involved would already have background with similar games ( or be a newb invited by more experienced gamers).<br/><br/>The game would be meant to be played in a single session generally and complexity would be something that was tied to the scenario set up and in player interactions during play itself.<br/><br/>So kinda like CDark in some regards.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
