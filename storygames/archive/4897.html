I'd like to leave it up to the players to create their setting, a la BW's world burning in it's varied incarnations. I'd also like to focus on the relationships between the characters in a big way, with lots of rivalries and love triangles messing things up. This all gets acted out against a backdrop of war, and the battles need to have a certain flashiness. In those battles, what I'd like to avoid is hardcore tactical sim stuff like in Heavy Gear or Mekton, but there needs to be some element of tactics in the battles (and maybe some gear fetish-ism).I don't think anyone would actually <i>die</i> in battle, unless it served the story in some way. <br/><br/>I've looked at Bliss Stage as well and while I like the concept, the execution doesn't quite work for me. Perhaps I don't want something so unrelentingly grim? Or at least a scalable level of angst?<br/><br/>Anyway, it's an idea I'd like to be able to try and flesh out a bit more. I'm just not sure how or where to start. So I'm throwing this out there - if anyone has any suggestions, fire away!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109755/#Comment_109755" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-27T00:17:36+00:00" title="November 27, 2007 12:17AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bliss Stage is your huckleberry.

And possibly use tokens to keep track of those, and let players use them to give other people interludes, or give them to each other in appreciation.  At each new mission, every pilot discards one token, if they have any left.<br/><br/>With more interludes to reduce stress and build trust and intimacy, the death spiral won't be as steep.<br/><br/>For <b>more</b> grim, watch <em>Bokurano</em>.<br/><br/>Or consider using <em>Polaris</em>?<br/><br/>Tactics doesn't really seem to be a strong point of any giant robot shows I know of, although something where you could choose degree of recklessness would be useful.<br/><br/>That's a good list of shows; I'm glad to see you're ignoring <em>Gasaraki</em> and hope you'll continue to do so.  But do seek out <em>Gunbuster 2</em> for over the top giant robot action.<br/><br/>As Wei-Hwa Huang once said:<br/><em>"Giant anthropomorphics have always been popular in Japanese pop culture. Godzilla, for instance.  It may have to do with the conflict between a desire to be powerful and an aversion to being known -- in a mecha<br/>suit, nobody knows you're really a teenager with glasses."</em><br/><br/>So maybe consider <em>Best Friends</em>, substituting "Pilot" for "Rich", unless Piloting is just a matter of "Cool".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109766/#Comment_109766" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-27T01:25:22+00:00" title="November 27, 2007  1:25AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ignore Carl.

Oh Noes!! if this continues <i>he might be in dangerz</i>!!!"), or why that whole subplot was totally dropped. Which sucked, because that is what pulled me into that anime. <br/><br/>HOWEVER, knowing Mike (who is big into military drama), I have to tell him that he'll want to at least check out the first 4-6 episodes or so for its gritty military real-world look at mecha.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109795/#Comment_109795" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-27T07:36:46+00:00" title="November 27, 2007  7:36AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Y'know, I don't have very clear memories of Gasaraki.

(If, uh... grim.)<br/><br/>Being such, I've also always wanted to play a good mecha game, but when I stop to think about it, I can't actually figure out what I'd want out of it. I mean, essentially, the robots as such are just equipment, they could as well have been armor or magic weapons or what have you, except for the fact that Giant Robots Look Cool, and such purely visual appeals to my mind isn't really something that, for me, adds much or works very well for an rpg.<br/><br/>So what, really, is it that they bring in terms of story and feel that one wants to include? (When not approaching it from a traditional tactical/simulation perspective, which there are plenty of decent games for.)<br/><br/>The one game I've seen that actually does something interesting with it is Bliss Stage, but BS is very much a different genre and very super robo. (I'd consider Evangelion solidly super robo--the superficial plot is very much a homage to old-style unique super-mecha fighting unique Giant Space Monsters to Save The World--even if technically the mecha are militarily produced.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix" title="zoatebix"><img alt="zoatebix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix">zoatebix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110522/#Comment_110522" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T23:01:31+00:00" title="November 29, 2007 11:01PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No love for Patlabor? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110524/#Comment_110524" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T23:08:43+00:00" title="November 29, 2007 11:08PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No love for Patlabor?

I'm a huuuuuuuge Macross fan and I've always wanted to have a gameplay experience that could be similar to Macross.  I wonder, and this might be really reaching here, if someone could smoosh together the combat mechanics and weapon details of Agon with the episodic storytelling approach of PTA.  This weird mish-mash somehow works in my brain.  <br/><br/>As for Ben's question, I'm actually pretty good friends with Dan Ravipinto and got to hear about the game and flip through the book through him.  While I wasn't given the impression that the game is totally grimsville, it did seem that it was rather <i>heavy</i>.  I like heavy, as Dan could attest, and I'm looking forward to playing some Bliss Stage, but I think that game is going to scratch a different itch than this other one that I'm picturing in my head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
