I'm not sure that's the right word, but just looking at, for example, <a href="http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3518654&amp;userid=0&amp;perpage=40&amp;pagenumber=1" rel="nofollow">this thread on board game design from the Something Awful forums</a>, it seems like board game designers have more and more varied tools and techniques, and more sophisticated metrics for evaluating games.<br/><br/>So, <b>what can RPGs learn from board games?</b><br/><br/>I'm sure other people around here can offer better insights than me (hence the thread), but here are a couple that come to mind:<br/><br/>One big one that's been on my mind a lot, especially since I started working on <a href="http://yarukizero.wordpress.com/channel-a/" rel="nofollow">a card game of my own</a>, is how RPGs by and large avoid using much of anything in the way of components, when those things just aren't all that hard to buy or even make, especially in terms of prototypes for playtesting. There was a bit of a learning curve, but at this point slapping basic card designs together and printing them up on cardstock at home has gotten downright routine for me. (Though making multiple iterations of a game that has over 300 cards will do that to you.)<br/><br/>Board games also seem to have do a much better job of creating an overall experience. Some of that undoubtedly comes from the nature of the different mediums, but the better board games nonetheless seem to have more thought put into them about the overall learning experience, from taking the shrink wrap off the box to mastering the game. I see a lot more talk about learning curves and strategic depth in board games, and when I look at D&amp;D4e for example, I see a well-designed game with mediocre presentation, a text that doesn't really know how to go about teaching you the game it contains.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398867/#Comment_398867" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-27T10:47:43+00:00" title="November 27, 2012 10:47AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm psyched about this thread since I'm such a board game noob.<br/><br/>One thing I've noticed is that board games include a lot more mechanical interaction between players. People are always taking cards from each other's hands, moving each other around the board, and in general interact in a way mediated by the mechanics.

It can be a test of proper balance in how to include the rules and what to leave out and what to reduce to simple iconography. Too much text and the cards/boards end up looking ugly and too wordy; too little and the players are forced to go back to the rulebook all the time. In this regard, I love the Apocalypse World playbooks as they have almost all the rules right there in the players hands. Of course there is a long history of rules cheat sheets with RPGs (ie., the classic GM screen) but this is less common with indie games. Rules cheat sheets are fine but really it's best if everything is right there with what is in your hand (cards, boards, character sheets). I say this as both a boardgamer and a roleplayer, as every time someone has to stop and check the rules it breaks the flow of the game.<br/><br/>As an aside there are a number of boardgames which are also partially role playing games: Decent (hack and slash), Mice &amp; Mystics (basically Mouseguard as a boardgame with story scenarios and everything), Arkham Horror (cooperative save the world from the Elder Gods), Dixit (build a story with pictures), Gloom (gothic family gets destroyed game which works best when a story is told with each card). Many of these games result in a story being played out over the course of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398877/#Comment_398877" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-27T11:32:00+00:00" title="November 27, 2012 11:32AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Visual presentation.  Using symbols, colors, cards and tokens to show the game state and the rules involved.  If I play Seven wonders, most of the rules are on the card simply as a set of iconic symbols.  This card has two bricks on it, and I know that that means it makes two brick per turn.  Some games could reduce their rules down to the simplest and have the rules encoded as icons on the artifacts of play (the character sheets, etc.) as reminders for the players.<br/><br/><br/>Different ways of structuring decision making and randomness.  The default old-style boardgame is to have the dice make most of the decision, as it is in D&amp;D and similar games: you choose to attack, but then the dice decide the actual success.  Decide, then roll to find the result.  In many euro-style boardgames, the randomness happens less often and earlier in the process: in Settlers of Catan, the randomness happens all before the important decisions of trading and building occur.  (And eurogamers often complain about this in Settlers and prefer games with randomness happening even further from the decision points.)  Fiasco is also good about this: the randomness all occurs at the Act breaks, and then the meaningful decisions flow from there, but aren't overridden by random die rolls.<br/><br/><br/>Cooperation versus competition.  In Puerto Rico and Settlers and a bunch of other games, you balance between cooperating and competing with the other players.  You take actions that help yourself as well as others, in the hope that they will benefit you more than they do the other players.  A game of competing but not entirely opposed PCs (e.g., a hypothetical game along the lines of Amber, Best Friends or Skulldugerry) could benefit from these sorts of mechanics.<br/><br/><br/>Meaningful conflicts that aren't confrontational or violent in nature.  Germany has rewards in place for making games that aren't violent in nature.  And so many successful euro-style boardgames are about farming or merchants or architects.  And there's still plenty of competition, but it's a sly, complicated competition without outright bringing down the pain on your enemies.  It shows that conflicts and stories can be told that don't end with life-or-death struggles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398880/#Comment_398880" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-27T11:59:30+00:00" title="November 27, 2012 11:59AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some of the Indie RPGs make me think of board games. I thought at the time "The Mountain Witch should be a board game"!<br/><br/>The board focuses play down on a manageable narrow window. The play pieces do the same. This is what KomradBob is talking about using miniatures and terrain. Many RPGs are so general in nature - they demand that you make up a world to play them in. Board games give you a world - visually rather than in a 300 page book. <br/><br/>The rules of board games are narrow and focused. They tell you what to do. This can be a bore in some wargames but in Euro games it gives a consistent, repeatable play experience. They don't have to limit player choice though. Fiasco effectively builds it's own board using cards. Engle Matrix Games (in some versions) have boards that the players move around on - making up stories. <br/><br/>The next change I see coming is when there is an easy way to load board games as apps for ipad (or other devices). Then board games can explode like RPGs did ten years ago. There can be a convergence of RPGs and boardgames then because it will be cheap to make them - so why not do it! This will be a neat watershed to see. <br/><br/>Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398886/#Comment_398886" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-27T12:34:21+00:00" title="November 27, 2012 12:34PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 27, 2012 12:35PM by mease19.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.5-3 hours is a satisfying sweet spot.  10-30 min 'fillers' get a lot of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/silby" title="silby"><img alt="silby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/silby">silby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398890/#Comment_398890" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-27T13:09:07+00:00" title="November 27, 2012  1:09PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What RPGs can learn from Dominion: For a complex game, there's no substitute for hundreds of hours of playtesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398898/#Comment_398898" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-27T14:10:31+00:00" title="November 27, 2012  2:10PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like what you're specially talking about, Ewan, is <i>product design</i>.

Most game-mechanics geekery talk focuses on the nifty dice/card mechanic, but little in where it fits in with actual play \u2014 this was especially true in the 90s. Most traditional rpg games are <i>"my character wants to do ____ so I roll to see if I can."</i> Whereas, most of the indie games discussed here \u2014 Apocalypse World, My Life With Master, Fiasco, Ghost/Echo, Dogs in the Vineyard, etc \u2014 push the fiction more to the forefront and often entangle the dice with the fiction: where the fiction informs the dice which inform the fiction.<br/><br/>One thing that happens a lot in more euro board games is that the ever changing nature of the game results more from the other players actions \x7frather than a die roll or card pull \u2014 Puerto Rico, Agricola, Belfort, etc. The player bases their next action on the state of the "board" and what moves/resources they have to use. Various diceless systems operate in this area to some extent.<br/><br/>Another aspect of board games is that they are meant to have a set play time and thus often have some sort of progression mechanic. Sometimes it's blatant in that you only have so many years/seasons/turns. Or sometimes it is determined by the play itself and can go up and down based on player actions like Arkham Horror's terror level and Elder Sign's clock. Lacuna's Heart Rate and Static mechanic is actually very board game like in that it is a direct measure of the story's progression. Personally, I think Cthulhu Dark would be great with a terror/weirdness/threat/adrenalin progression mechanic of some sort. Hollowpoint has a progress mechanic in that the scene difficulty grows in proportion to previous successful scenes. On the opposite end of the spectrum, in Mythender, the character dice pools get ever more ridiculously huge as the game progresses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398909/#Comment_398909" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-27T15:27:23+00:00" title="November 27, 2012  3:27PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also wanted to add a note on packaging and presentation.

The most popular contemporary designs do this in a few ways.<br/><br/>They embrace competition. You can't have wining and losing if you don't embrace competition as being a core part of the experience. But if you notice - when you're playing a great board game, the single fact of win/lose is FAR from the only enjoyable part about the experience. Just because winning and losing is a thing, doesn't mean it's the only thing.<br/><br/>They keep it fast. The worst board games are the ones where you know you're way behind the curve and you still have 2 hours of play ahead of you. More recent designs tend to play faster than older games in a similar vein. (Compare History of the World to Small World)<br/><br/>They keep the results of failure small but meaningful. Great board games give you lots of opportunities to make optimal and suboptimal decisions while trying to make it so that you don't risk losing everything with just one suboptimal choice. (In other words, death isn't constantly on the line.)<br/><br/>The best implementation of these ideals I've seen in RPGs to date are in the *World games.<br/><br/>The fact that the GM is given procedures that help make sure that failure is fun and not a gaping hole of empty boringness is HUGE! Yeah, you can bolt the fail forward idea onto other games, but it helps so much when it's built right in to the core.<br/><br/>Also, the way the fiction first approach encourages failures of types other than death is huge and important. It makes me feel like I can take risks and try crazy things that may have consequences but are unlikely to have death as a consequence. Conditions, for example, make great consequences.<br/><br/>I am hopeful that future games will build on those learnings.<br/><br/>As a group culture, though, I see a lot of resistance to the idea of embracing the gamey elements. There are reasons for that, and I get that. But I'd like to see more folks ready to grapple with that. (Yeah I'm being vague here. I don't want to derail unless people are really interested in this thought.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398924/#Comment_398924" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-27T16:48:49+00:00" title="November 27, 2012  4:48PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1 Arkham Horror.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398928/#Comment_398928" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-27T17:01:31+00:00" title="November 27, 2012  5:01PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adroid: Netrunner made me realize that games are way more compelling when you need to play close attention when other people are doing things.

Plus games that don't use a strict turn order and allow things to go in all sorts of wacky order can help keep you engaged rather than waiting for your turn to come round.<br/><br/>Strict rounds involving many players with long turns that don't involve the other players are usually considered less great design.<br/><br/>The emphasis on spotlight time in tabletop games needs to be structured with an awareness of this potential pitfall.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398934/#Comment_398934" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-27T17:34:44+00:00" title="November 27, 2012  5:34PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will second rules presentation (board games spread the rules over cards or sheets which ease up the basic rules) and how one action will affect other people and therefore making one player's actions is interesting in all eyes.<br/><br/>Another thing we can learn is how to make a game complex by using small means. You don't need 7000 feats with +2 bonuses to make  a game complex. What you need is some basic rules that the other specific rules then break. In Magic, you got the basic rules (turn sequence, mana, combat, how to win) and then Strike First, Flying, Discard, Draw, Reshuffle that changes the basic rules et c.<br/><br/>By limiting the options of what you can do, you will achieve a lot. You will decrease the number of pages it takes to explain the rules. Your game will be more focused and handle that specific thing really well (Story Now games are actually great at this). You will also make the game become more complex, by letting the other players limiting the options for each other.<br/><br/>RPGs mostly rely on agon - the chance. What are the chances of this succeeding? Boardgames mostly rely on risks. Is it worth doing this and what will the consequences be?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398939/#Comment_398939" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-27T18:16:00+00:00" title="November 27, 2012  6:16PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, boardgames have made great strides into making you be involved during other people's turns.

If you a fighting a guy, and you want to jump up on the table and swing from the chandelier, but the rules don't allow, tough luck, pal!<br/><br/>From the Euro design world, there's "build up, not tear down." This is where at the end of the game, even if you've lost in a pitiful fashion, at least you can still gave upon your world that you've built (however pitiful it may be), and still feel like you've accomplished something. Monopoly is the opposite of this, where you sit in the corner after you've lost and complain you are flat broke because Chuck didn't make that sweet deal with you an hour ago.<br/><br/>'Abstraction' Maybe one or two rules have some semblence of real life going-on; the rest of the rules really just support those main premises, and have a theme merely tacked on to them, because in board game world, the system is what's important, and making sure that that is what works is the first priority. My god, Dominion is a prime example of this...I've never read a game box that I think so inaccurately describes what you are doing in the game, but man, the game is in general a tightly wound piece of machinery.  And what's probably the most amusing thing about it, which no one ever notices that it's missing, is that the cards feature no "flavor text" to try and help "sell" the pasted on theme that almost all theme-y card games have imprinted on them since the dawn of Magic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398976/#Comment_398976" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-28T06:18:46+00:00" title="November 28, 2012  6:18AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know that I've got great insight on boardgames, but here are a couple of things from games that I like that might be useful:<br/><br/>The play of the game itself is more fun than winning. Winning is just the cherry on top, and win conditions are more of a shut-off switch than anything else. Apples to Apples comes to mind, but Aye Dark OverLord and Mad Scientist University also. Those are also games where human judgment is core to play and considered entirely okay. RPGers/SGers seem to have some real issues with that human judgment part at times.<br/><br/>There are multiple paths to a win, or at least score points. I'd put Alhambra in this category, along with Ticket to Ride.<br/><br/>They tend to be pretty forgving to beginners. Alhambra's multiple rounds with increased point scoring at each one gives an almost practice round feel at the game's beginning.<br/><br/>You don't generally re-arrange the entire board part way through play. Admittedly, I'm only referring to problems folks have mentioned with the more minis-use heavy forms of D&amp;D, or other RPGs played heavily tactically with minis. Boardgamers and even minis wargamers would never consider it a good idea to up and re-set an entire table partway through a session, because that would be annoying and dumb.<br/><br/>People like toys. Axis&amp;Allies, Last Night on Earth, Ticket to Ride, and Memoir '44 all benefit from the appeal of their toylike components, and would be much less appealiing if simple chits were used instead. They'd be no less playable mechanically. Euro-games seem to go in the opposite direction, using simple, abstract, stylish components, but that style is an appealing thing in a different sort of way all on its own.<br/><br/>If you are going to use toylike components, semi-abstracted/area movement and positioning is not only okay, it's probably preferable to zoomed-in tactical movement. It doesn't mean you can't, or don't want to, use "color" reperesentations on your play surface. Last Night on Earth is again the one I point to for this sort of appeal.<br/><br/>The supplement treadmill actually does work, when you do it the right way. Going along with that, show love to your fans that create fan materials, provided it doesn't mess with your core revenue stream, and be willing to offer minor add-ons for free, especially as downloads. I think dirty-hippy gamers already have this one down, but worth mentioning.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398979/#Comment_398979" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-28T06:51:26+00:00" title="November 28, 2012  6:51AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I could write a book on this topic.

Totally. I've been working in some way to combine an RPG with a card game. My idea was to make rpgs more accessible to newbies but so far my intent still bounces with the barrier of the physical objects: it's like, when players get to see their characters pieced on cards, they stop thinking out of the box. I'm hoping this is just happening because I'm adding too much rules and/or the mechanics are still unbaked and confusing... but a part of me fears there's a huge wall between these two worlds and that's the reason we haven't seen the two merge earlier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398997/#Comment_398997" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-28T09:28:11+00:00" title="November 28, 2012  9:28AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2012 9:57AM by TylerT.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>I could write a book on this topic.

These features can possibly co-exist, but they don't naturally support each other or anything like that. Usually you can ramp up the theme only so far before the tactics start to suffer, and vice versa. Even heavily simulationist wargames don't usually even try to model the decisions made by a single general, as it would introduce too much luck in the game.<br/><br/>In presentation sense boardames have many advantages, but the lack of visual components in RPGs is not just a negative feature for me. Minis and floor maps can be cool, but it's really fun and more immersive for me just to imagine the fiction in my head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399103/#Comment_399103" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-29T06:23:48+00:00" title="November 29, 2012  6:23AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also believe the lack of a visual interface helps a lot with inmersion, when it doesn't provoke the players into bringing/creating their own visualization of the shared fiction.

You mean, we aren't actually, like, building this glorious castle? They just go in a line?"<br/>"Oh, no, we ARE building the castle, it's just that we only keep track of bricks that we deliver!"<br/>"So we aren't building the castle."<br/>"YES WE ARE!"<br/>"But you just said that we are only delivering them...."<br/>"okay, fine, delivering the bricks."<br/>"Yellow rectangles"<br/>"Bricks! And it doesn't matter anyway, because the Provost hasn't opened the butcher yet, so you can't sell your pigs for food and money."<br/>"I don't see a sign saying it's closed..."<br/>"The white circle, that's the Bailiff, buildings are closed to the left of him, but open to the right."<br/>"That's not what a Bailiif does. That doesn't make much sense."<br/>"That's okay, you can have the Provost bribe him to not move."<br/>"Why would a Provost do that?"<br/>"Because he has influence!"<br/>"That's not really why, that's how. And It's not really a bribe. More like extortion or calling in favors or something..."<br/>"Anyway, the Provost is the white circle. He moves, too. You can bribe him to not move, or to move."<br/>"Okay. Sounds like a sweet deal. For him"<br/>"Anyway, since he's here you can use the Puppet Show  to exchange 4 wood for 3 cloth and 1 silver."<br/>"Which, in reality, are THESE colored cubes?"<br/>"No, those are wood, cloth and silver."<br/>"Which are colored cubes."<br/>"Why do you have to make things so difficult?"<br/>"You realize almost nothing you've said actually talked about building a castle like that which is depicted on the box?"<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399206/#Comment_399206" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-30T00:29:47+00:00" title="November 30, 2012 12:29AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep.

In some way is like railroading (well, more like rollercoasting/good railroading) but it doesn't feel wrong because everyone knows where the fun is and that they don't need to break the game to have their own. And in the end there will be a winner.<br/><br/>That's why I love RPGs that are focused into specific genres and make good use of their mechanics to achieve a particular atmosphere/ellicit a particular roleplaying style on their players. A good GM can also have the same effect on any game, but it takes a lot of experience from both the GM and the rest of the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399244/#Comment_399244" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-30T11:07:41+00:00" title="November 30, 2012 11:07AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The best rpgs focus on how the game is played at the table, and get this, the best board games focus on how the game is played at the table. (Or larps at the conference center, or sports in the field, or video games in front of the tv, etc)<br/><br/>Tools. All the stuff from both types of games are just a bunch of tools. When a designer figures out how she wants the game to go down at the table with real players and works towards that, then we'll have a better game. I think it's a mistake to begin designing a rpg or a board game. I think you should design what you want the experience itself to be like. Use a board if you want people to move pieces around as part of play or use a 300 page book if you want people flipping through it for reference during play. Just don't call it anything before it's where you want it. Don't pigeon-hole yourself.<br/><br/>But man, play some board games if you don't already. Hell, play a type of game that you don't already ESPECIALLY if you want to design a game. I'm really tired of rpgs designed by people who play mostly rpgs. I can't tell you how many times that I walk into End Game, flipping through all the different rpg books and seeing the same things over and over and over. <br/><br/><br/>That said (sorry about my mini-rant), here's my list of awesome tools from board games:<br/><br/>-A board and pieces instead of paper and pencil. (erasing all the time sucks)<br/>-Cards. (slightly predictable randomization, physical interaction, I don't have to write shit down, many more)<br/>-Taking turns (The quiet person gets to play as much as the loudmouth)<br/>-Goals/Endgame (Something to work toward, less meandering around)<br/>-A box. (It's all in a box! Not a problem for most of us, but if you want new players or convenience)<br/>-No prep (aside from reading the rules, which yes, many board games are bad at too)<br/>-Mechanics that are integral (too many rpgs have mechanics which are extra, whereas most board games are the mechanics)<br/><br/>There's also a load of stuff that board games can learn from rpgs!<br/><br/>tl;dr .... play these board games: Battlestar Galactica, Apples to Apples, risk legacy, and Tales of Arabian Nights. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doho123" title="doho123"><img alt="doho123" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doho123">doho123</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399246/#Comment_399246" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-30T11:50:02+00:00" title="November 30, 2012 11:50AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>tl;dr .... play these board games: Battlestar Galactica, Apples to Apples, risk legacy, and Tales of Arabian Nights. <br/><br/></blockquote>\nWhile I'm sure that there others (like the Descent series, or the new WOTC lineup of D&amp;D board games), out of the games that I've played....<br/><br/>Battlestar Galactica and Tales of the Arabian Nights are probably the two  board games that come closest to playing like an RPG...even though TofAN is severely broken the way my wife played it (always selecting "drink/get drunk" as a response to every encounter winds up with pretty much the same result all of the time). <br/><br/>Dixit is a nice Apples to Apples variant that lets you flex your creative muscles a bit....even though the scoring in Dixit is a little head-scratching to understand.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399248/#Comment_399248" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-30T12:05:08+00:00" title="November 30, 2012 12:05PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The reason I say to play Apples to Apples INSTEAD of Dixit (which, yes I like better too) is because Apples to Apples is more elegant, is played by more people, and is easier to play than Dixit.

I thought I'd add one specific example of a board game mechanic that I personally really like and extrapolate how this could be applied to RPGs. <br/><br/><b>Bidding or Using an Action/Resource to Change Turn Order or Gain Advantage</b><br/>Some board games allow turn order to change, usually by having a player choose to use up a "worker" (basically an action) to choose to go first on the next turn. Example games are Agricola and Belfort (which allows players to choose 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.). This potentially allows them to pick the best option for their worker on the following turn before another player grabs it up. This can be applied to RPGs by allowing a player to use up an action or resource or chuck of their dice pool to go first on the following turn or to gain some other advantage or better positioning. These points/dice could be just used directly to buy a better position or they could be used with some secret or open bidding mechanic. With simulationist style mechanics this directly applies to typical conflict resolution where a fighter holds back to follow up with a strike that is faster and harder or a lawyer refuses to cross examine the witness so as to bring forth a new surprise witness. This can also be used for more narrative play where a player may choose to let someone else throw a money wrench to their scene so as to be able to set the stage for the next scene where their character has an advantage.<br/><br/><b>As an addendum, a few games you should play</b>: Agricola (really feels like the tight struggle to run a farm), Twilight Struggle (amazing cold war game which feels like you are playing out history), <a href="http://www.gizmet.com/games/fluffybunny.html" rel="nofollow">Fluffy Bunny Tea Party</a> (roleplaying is encouraged with this card game and the "must remain polite" rule is great), Seven Wonders (frankly the theme is barely duct taped on but the game is amazing), Mice &amp; Mystics (haven't played it but I thought I'd add it as I hear it's great at doing the dungeon crawl adventure thing).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>What can RPGs learn from board games? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17601/what-can-rpgs-learn-from-board-games/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="What can RPGs learn from board games? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17601/what-can-rpgs-learn-from-board-games/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="My worst board game experience was Tales of the Arabian Nights.

(erasing all the time sucks)<br/>-Cards. (slightly predictable randomization, physical interaction, I don't have to write shit down, many more)<br/>-Taking turns (The quiet person gets to play as much as the loudmouth)<br/>-Goals/Endgame (Something to work toward, less meandering around)<br/>-A box. (It's all in a box! Not a problem for most of us, but if you want new players or convenience)<br/>-No prep (aside from reading the rules, which yes, many board games are bad at too)<br/>-Mechanics that are integral (too many rpgs have mechanics which are extra, whereas most board games are the mechanics)</blockquote>\nTaking turns is something I'd like to see more, I hate the social mini-game of trying to interrupt the player currently explaining his plans. Physical components are something that are handy, but I think most designers don't use them simply because they can't be manufactured by typing stuff down in your home. At least that'd be my reason.<br/><br/>Integral mechanics are the current story-game ideal, and goals and endgames are not unheard of.

Some RPG producers could benefit of this way of thinking. You don't need to explain why you designed every part in a certain way. Let the participants discover it.<br/><br/>One thing I've learned is to not explain how to play the game, but to instead design the game so they have to play it in a certain way. Boardgames has procedures to follow, and RPGs - even if there is no game mechanics - has procedures as well.

The mechanics handle issues, spell everything out, and give you a finite number of choices.  This works because you are optimizing moves and trying to outwit your opponent.<br/><br/>-There is no pressure to deliver in Board gaming.  You rise and fall on your own accord and no one is counting on you to guide them or bail them out when the narrative is stuck.<br/><br/>-Board games are concise, accessible, and visually engaging before you even begin.  They beg you to play them.  RPGs make you take a course, study on your own, and then throw you give you a grueling exam.<br/><br/>-Board game strategy is easy to grasp and teach.  Proper narrative gaming can be harder to teach/learn although when everything is firing on all cylinders it can be unrivaled.<br/><br/>-Board games require little obligation.  Jeremy, Phil, and Chris don't have to show up next time we play Eclipse and the story won't suffer because of it.<br/><br/>-Many board games provide an excellent solo experience.  This keeps me engaged with the hobby when no one is around.  I can fly my weekly mission in B-17: Queen of the Skies, stomp over the countryside with my Mage Knight, or rescue a family from a burning building and I am engaging with the game fully - despite friends not being around.<br/><br/>-Board games are visually stimulating in a way RPGs will never be.  If a friend comes over and I have Claustrophobia or Duel in the Dark set up on my table - he's going to sit down and play.  If I have Dogs in the Vineyard on my desk, we may chat about why it's cool.<br/><br/>-Lastly, Board games are transparent.  When we finished our 4 player game of Eclipse on Sunday and I came in second - I knew instinctively what I should have done differently and how I could improve my strategy.  When we finish a 3 hour session of Primetime Adventures and things didn't really click, it can be painful to talk about why and analyze behavior/emotions that are intagible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399574/#Comment_399574" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-04T13:32:52+00:00" title="December  4, 2012  1:32PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Raph Koster unintentionally tells us a bunch of things RPGs do better than board and video games:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.raphkoster.com/gaming/howgamesthink.shtml" rel="nofollow">raphkoster.com/gaming/howgamesthink.shtml</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399646/#Comment_399646" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-05T03:23:59+00:00" title="December  5, 2012  3:23AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great Article Paul!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blinks" title="blinks"><img alt="blinks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/169/nF4SQKHK03HTX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blinks">blinks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399675/#Comment_399675" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-05T10:20:32+00:00" title="December  5, 2012 10:20AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I've taken from euro games: <b>self-balancing mechanics</b>.  There are a ton of euros with auction mechanics: it means each play group can individually adjust the balance. Got a group that thinks attacking is too powerful? They'll bid attacks up! A group that never attacks? They'll get cheap!<br/><br/>Another: <b>limiting choices through a chit pull</b> (or, more recently: deck building) mechanic. Best way to reduce analysis paralysis is to reduce the number of choices! Just give players only a subset of their total options each turn. Perhaps give them a way to add options to the overall set, so the complexity grows, but limit the options available at any one time.<br/><br/>Another: allow players to <b>learn and modify their strategy</b> during short games. Poker, for example, is played in many small sessions (hands, in this case), so each session allows you to experiment with a slightly different strategy. Many Dominion players will say the same about that game (online, it takes five minutes to play a "hand"). Why not build RPGs with scenes like Poker with hands? Compress character construction down to the deal (perhaps with a discard), where the dealer is the DM? Characters with a stake in the scene have to ante to show up?\ufeff                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399870/#Comment_399870" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-06T17:04:57+00:00" title="December  6, 2012  5:04PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2012 5:07PM by Rickard.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I remember reading up on how to produce a game on gameboardgeeks and I read something like "You should at least go for 1000 copies of your game", and I thought "Yeah, right". Perhaps selling more copies is what we need to learn? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Make roleplaying games look like a game, and not a book. You want to attract gamers, not readers.<br/><br/>Only create a term when you really need one. Terms are there to ease up explanation, but I've seen a lot of amateur productions that overuse terms. I do it as well, even if I'm fully aware of this behaviour. I always need to go through every term and question it's existence when my game is finished.<br/><br/>And now I've come to why I even started to write this. I actually forgot it while writing all that other stuff before, so I was fortunate to recall it. This is what some of the roleplaying games totally miss, but what would render a boardgame useless if it didn't have it: it's designed with every participant in mind. It seems obvious really, but I've seen the lack of this in sooo many RPGs. How about combat rounds in which the participants are taking <i>one</i> action, and can't interfere with other people's actions? How about rules that takes so much time to go through, that if more than two participants are in the situation, it bogs down the system? How about having one player going to places where no other participant can go, like the astral planet, cyberspace or the dreamlands? I really like games that supports active listening. Games like Polaris, Dogs in the Vineyard or Zombie Cinema. Those games has been designed with everybody at the table in mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399930/#Comment_399930" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T06:15:37+00:00" title="December  7, 2012  6:15AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm noticing an undercurrent running through this discussion: board games use emergent complexity, while RPGs front-load a lot of complexity.<br/>BG: You have a pretty basic, if not trivial choice to begin the game<br/>RPG: You have to absorb much of the whole system to make meaningful starting choices about PC creation.<br/><br/>BG: Game mechanics build toward complex choices in the late game.<br/>RPG: In Scene 1, you have nearly every systemic choice on the table, with few major systemic additions as characters/story progress.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399932/#Comment_399932" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T06:44:56+00:00" title="December  7, 2012  6:44AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can people talk more about mechanics?

Carcassonne gameplay is defined by the fact that players build the board on which they seize resources. Stone Age gameplay hinges on the fact that any given resource-producing location can become fully occupied and thus unavailable to any other player for that turn.<br/>--<br/>Risk/reward balances are typically much more in the forefront (and more balanced) in boards games than in RPGs. Risk/reward in the sense of a well-designed golf course: one can limp to par with a fairly high degree of certainty; but if one wants birdie, one risks bogey or worse.<br/><br/>Smallworld puts this right in your face, with the reinforcements die. One or two dudes short of taking a territory? Roll the die and see if you get 1, 2, or 3 more "one-shot" tiles to use in that conquest, or do you roll one of the three blank faces? (Losing a battle for a territory costs the loser one of their tiles involved in the conflict.)<br/>--<br/>Board games tend to have minimal points of contact in any given decision point; while RPGs tend to have a slew of options, bolt-on bonuses, special cases, etc. that can apply to any given moment of handling. A board game has a reference card or a couple of chits to calculate all impacts to an encounter; an RPGs has 100lbs. of supplements, GM screens, *and* reference cards (i.e., character sheets).<br/>---<br/>Annnd...

There's still a complex strategy element on what choices you make each turn, so you can prepare for that eventuality.<br/><br/>I also love the way the Battlestar Galactica BG keeps the tone of the tv show: one or more of the players can actually be an undercover cylon working against the rest of the group, but mechanically there's no sure way to find out who. In the best case, one player can find out and tell it, but again, nobody can't tell if the accuser isn't actually a cylon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399950/#Comment_399950" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T09:18:22+00:00" title="December  7, 2012  9:18AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aside from presentation the other big thing here is # of Players and constant playtime.

It's for 2-4 players, and one sessions takes 1-2 hours. And I've found it's really important to make that clear to people, because it's so far from the normal expectations for an RPG. You'd be hard-pressed to get a convention time slot of less than 4 hours, and someone I sent the manuscript to once tried running the game for like 7 hours straight and wondered why it went off the rails.<br/><br/>Having created a talky, creative card game that me and my friends really like, I find we've gotten an order of magnitude more play in than for my RPG creations precisely because it's got so much smaller of a social footprint.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399995/#Comment_399995" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T12:35:21+00:00" title="December  7, 2012 12:35PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Board games are often aimed at whole families.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa" title="Bad_Santa"><img alt="Bad_Santa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://anvalisok.com/cthulhu.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa">Bad_Santa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400007/#Comment_400007" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T13:11:02+00:00" title="December  7, 2012  1:11PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only problem with BSG, I tried a little roleplaying once, I was the captain of the Pegasus, so my complete willingness to sacrifice those I saw as weak made everyone think I was a cylon.<br/><br/>Mechanically, I love Eclipse.  A game about running an interstellar empire, you have a player board that denotes your current resources, researched technologies and incomes.  When you take over a planet, you take a marker from your board and put it on the central map, the space uncovered on your player board is your new income.<br/><br/>Actions and controlling sectors of space work similarly.  You have a track of discs, as you uncover spaces the cost goes up.  Each sector of space requires a disc, as does each action, so the larger and busier your empire, the more it costs.  If you can't afford your costs at the end of a round, you have to give up control over sectors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400015/#Comment_400015" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T13:56:41+00:00" title="December  7, 2012  1:56PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2012 1:59PM by Colinaut.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the interesting aspects that separates different boardgames from each other is where the action is taking place. With some games all the action is taking place on a single game board which players are contesting over (Monopoly, Small World, Ticket to Ride, Twilight Struggle, etc.) or cooperating to best (Arkham Horror, Flashpoint). In other games (usually Euro-style), most of the action is taking place in front of each player where the player is building their farm/city/empire/etc (Puerto Rico, Agricola, Seven Wonders, Race for the Galaxy, Dominion [depending on card set], etc.). In the latter style, there is very little player to player conflict but there is often a competition for resources or the best cards. Some games are a mixture of both where you are building up in front of you and have a central board where the main conflict occurs (Power Grid, Belfort).<br/><br/>Most roleplaying and story games are focused on a shared board experience as they are all playing against a common threat or cooperatively building a common world/story. Some story games are more focused on each characters individual struggle even though the players are all playing together in the same world/story: My Life With Master comes to mind in this regard, as does Polaris, maybe Sorcerer, and in a certain light Fiasco.<br/><br/>There are many many boardgames with this <i>build in front of yourself</i> style which explore different means of subtle player interaction. It would be an interesting endeavor to mine this angle for more ideas for story games which act more in this self-focused manner but still retain an interlinked story. I'm specifically thinking of world/story building story games like Microscope and The Quiet Year which at the moment are all about a single story but could be transformed into something which creates more interlinked individual stories. However it could also be more in line with Fiasco style play too. Looking at movies for reference of this style of narrative: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108122/" rel="nofollow">Short Cuts</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102943/" rel="nofollow">Slacker</a> (sorta as the stories aren't very interlinked), <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/" rel="nofollow">Dr. Strangelove</a> (this movie really is several interlinked stories each lead by one main character: Brig. Gen. Jack Ripper, President Merkin Muffley, and Maj. 'King' Kong).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400074/#Comment_400074" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-08T03:00:29+00:00" title="December  8, 2012  3:00AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm gonna ramble a bit, but I'm still fascinated by the theme vs tactics dichotomy. In RPGs the theme is usually the king all the way through, unless we're talking about very action- and tactics-heavy games. In BGs the theme is interesting first, but gradually the mechanics take completely over. When I'm playing my 15th game of Chaos in the Old World or Dominion or Small World, I don't really think about the theme any more. My mind is fixed on the math of beating my opponents. <br/><br/>I've been playing WFRP 3 lately, and in the game there are sort of two components to engage with. There's of course the story, and roleplaying out your character. Then there are the mechanics, which are all about playing with a very abstract system to optimize your guy's actions. There are loads of ways to improve your attack: new levels in Strength, permanent fortune dice to Strength, training your Weapon Skill, a whole deck of cards of different actions and talents, skill specializations. They are there to satisfy the boardgamer in us: the fictional counterparts are abstract as hell, and usually forgotten in the heat of optimization. It's like I have to constantly jump between two modes: either I play a boardgame and try to win, or I play my character. It's not totally jarring, but it's often an uneasy mix. <br/><br/>I guess my point is that the biggest hook in boardgames is tactics, but that's very hard to import to RPGs painlessly. Tactics has a tendency to enslave theme and make immersive-minded players really uncomfortable. And that's only if you succeed in the tactics part: in the worst case you have a lot of suboptimal options that nobody ever takes, and the game ends up as much more monotonic than you imagined.<br/><br/>Many posters play up the worldbuilding and interesting options represented by attractive physical components in BGs. And I don't deny it's fun to set plastic dragons (or red cubes) on colorful cardboard squares. But what gives those options relevancy are the victory conditions: and that's one thing RPGs don't have an easy relationship with. In RPG design we must seek other kinds of relevancy, a challenge unknown to BG designers.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400349/#Comment_400349" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T10:39:43+00:00" title="December 10, 2012 10:39AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just put up <a href="http://yarukizero.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/board-games-and-rpgs-peerless-food-fighters/" rel="nofollow">a blog post about thoughts stemming from this thread</a>, and my attempt at an RPG with heavily board game style presentation, Peerless Food Fighters.<br/><br/>I think people have already touched on this sort of thing, but yesterday I ended up playing <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38453/space-alert" rel="nofollow">Space Alert</a>, and I was kind of struck by how good it is at teaching you how to play. The game gives you audio recordings that present threats and give you a time limit, and you have to set up your action cards so that everything gets done and your spaceship doesn't get obliterated. The full game gives you a lot of different things to juggle, and it has a series of tutorials to help you acclimate to them a bit at a time. You alternate between having someone read a silly but accurate in-character monologue of a training seminar and doing a few 10-minute training scenarios that gradually introduce more and more of the rules. I'd really like to see more RPGs that more rigorously tackle the teaching aspect of getting into a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400359/#Comment_400359" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T11:39:47+00:00" title="December 10, 2012 11:39AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't forget that not all board games are a resource-management beat-your-opponents in X turns type experiences.<br/><br/>I started a thread about Diplomacy and how it could be mined for story game material (although we didn't get too far) a while back:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/13435/diplomacy-inspired-design-in-a-story-game-medium" rel="nofollow">Diplomacy-inspired design in a story games medium</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17601/what-can-rpgs-learn-from-board-games" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17601/what-can-rpgs-learn-from-board-games" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17601/what-can-rpgs-learn-from-board-games/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F17601%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F17601%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
