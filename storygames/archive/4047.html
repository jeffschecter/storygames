There's really no such thing as "physical proximity", is there? I need to know more about your dream physics.)</blockquote>\nThe characters are going into dream combat with both sides wanting the death of the other. Hiding away isn't an option. Physical proximity is a state of mind. As dreams go, there aren't a lot of physics. Basically it boils down to two things:<br/><br/>1) You cannot metamorphose your opponent, only the environment.<br/><br/>2) Everything you try to do can be opposed by someone else. Harming them requires using the dreamscape or "physically" hitting them. "I point my finger and he dies" would only work if your skill check beat his defenses by enough to kill him.<br/><br/>Opposition is handled using skills. For instance, your Craft (metals) check to impale the opponent inside a spike-filled adamantium cage could be opposed by their dodge to jump out before it closes, resistance to bounce the spikes off their manly chest, or melee to chop the cage apart. You counter gambit that realigns gravity and turns the ground under them into a cliff uses Survival and could be opposed by Athletics to find a handhold, Lore to envision a First Age flying machine that takes the form of mechanical wings sprouting from your back, martial arts to grab your ankles and hang like Spidey from the Green Goblin, or Craft (Stonework) to project a staircase from the wall.<br/><br/>Basically it'll be attack rolls opposed by defenses, with the attack and defense based on whatever skill the player can realistically tie to it. And since realism is so fluid in a dream, I can't think of anything that won't be allowed as long as the visuals tie to the theme of the skill (i.e. no Conjuring swarms of ants with Linguistics unless they put on an especially convincing show).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
