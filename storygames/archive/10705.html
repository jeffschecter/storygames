The reason is that scientists only publish papers on successes, while failures, while ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO SCIENCE, are embarrassing and covered up. Or even if not embarrassing, there simply was never an outlet to document exactly what was hypothesized, what was tried, and how it failed. Not until the Journal of Negative Results. which is a collection of failures. Without this journal, other scientists might try the exact same series of experiments, not realizing that someone else tried it already. Learning about failures is helpful: If nothing else, if you want to put the hypothesis to work, you can perhaps build off of failed experiments.<br/><br/>So, over to game design: Most positive results end up in published games. What about those ideas that failed? This thread is dedicated to those failed ideas. It might be the backbone of a whole new game, or possible a side-rule or hack to an existing game you have.<br/><br/>Here's the format. Show off your idea graveyard in the following format:<br/><br/><b>[THE BASIC NAME OF YOUR IDEA]</b><br/>* <b>Name:</b> The Name of the Project that you Experimented With (or "Unnamed" if it was just an idea)<br/>* <b>Hypothesis:</b> Your Hypothesis statement: What you intended to get out of this design or idea.<br/>* <b>Experiment:</b> What your experiment consisted of.

You can be brief.<br/>* <b>Failure:</b> Why it failed, in your mind.<br/>* <b>Takeaway:</b> What you learned from the experience, if you used the results in another way, if you are still trying to make it work, etc.<br/><br/>Stick to the format, and let's see some of your results!<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237435/#Comment_237435" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-14T10:13:56+00:00" title="October 14, 2009 10:13AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2009 10:14AM by Andy.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll start with this one. <br/><br/><b>[HOROSCOPE/PLANET DICE]</b><br/>* <b>Name:</b> Unnamed<br/>* <b>Hypothesis:</b> Design a game or a rule mechanic for an existing game which use either Astrological Horoscope dice, Astrological Planet Symbol dice, or both:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41a7Rv8bzvL._SL500_AA280_.jpg"/><br/>* <b>Experiment:</b> Not very far. A lot of thinking but nothing on paper: First, a game from scratch. Then, perhaps a mechanic for an existing game. Neither produced results.<br/>* <b>Failure:</b> In short, while I love the concept that there are both astrological sign dice, and astrological planet-symbol dice, in the end I've got zero interest in astrology, horoscopes and the like ("Oh, you rolled 'Leo'(or 'Mars' on the black die). So something war-like happens!"). None. So basically it was an issue of wanting to use something pretty, but then only later realizing that I had no interest in any possible outcome of the results. It would be like marketing a product I have no faith or interest in. Or, to make an interesting rule or mechanic, it would involve rolling the dice in such a way as to be unfamiliar to me: A new way to roll dice, totally outside of skill/stat/conflict result/etc, which would take more effort than I was willing to invest.<br/>* <b>Takeaway:</b> While I'd love to see someone else's take on these dice, I have since put more focus on working with pretty elements that I'm actually interested in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237443/#Comment_237443" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-14T10:47:32+00:00" title="October 14, 2009 10:47AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 14, 2009 10:48AM by Colin_Fredericks.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I LOVE the JNR.

But anyway...<br/><br/>* Name: Silent Sound Alpha 1.0<br/>* Hypothesis: Design a dice economy that will reflect the character's internal emotional state based on the actions and outcomes of the character's decisions.<br/>* Experiment: I ran 3 playtest sessions which included one dedicated character creation session.<br/>* Failure: Players started making decisions based on where they wanted the dice economy to end up, rather than just playing and seeing what the state of the machine was in hindsight.  Also the machine tended to move faster than expected which caused the players to "lock up" in their decision making lest the machine move any more.<br/>* Takeaway:  You have to allow "breathing room" in your game.  There has to be places where a decision is just a decision and doesn't necessarily start up the wheels and cogs of the dice machine no matter how interesting it seems to have A cause B which sets of C and ultimately causes D in the fiction.  You have to trust that the fiction matters and will inform the mechanic decisions without that necessarily being an explicit step.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237514/#Comment_237514" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-14T13:38:18+00:00" title="October 14, 2009  1:38PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>ASCII <a href="/forums/profile/HACK">@HACK</a> Elements</b></span><br/><b>Name:</b> ASCII <a href="/forums/profile/HACK">@HACK</a>: The Roguelike RPG<br/><b>Hypothesis:</b> Elements bought as Talents are permanent, and represent a sort of "hit points" that must be reduced (to d4s) to "kill" the Adventurer. Gear is cheaper to buy and to increase, but didn't have to be knocked down to kill the Adventurer. Gear also can be found in the dungeon, while Trait increasing or creating had to happen at Home. The notion is that intrinsic Talents are more useful and provide durability, but Gear is easier to "find" (i.e. create with Tokens) and can be far more powerful for the same cost as a Trait.<br/><b>Experiment:</b> One playtest at a convention, with players who'd never read the rules.<br/><b>Failure:</b> A min-max point exists where it is best to buy Talents right up until it's best to buy Gear. Further, neither type of Element fueled narration as much as I thought (they are like DitV Traits or Universalis Facts). The game devolved into mechanical efficacy calculation, rather than cool invocations of Gear or Talents (and Stunts--super-cheap but one-use dice).<br/><b>Takeaway:</b> There's more going on under the hood of DitV Trait (or Universalis Fact) invocation than just flavorful Trait descriptions/names.

The main issues I was facing were that I wanted the game to be mechanically interesting enough to maintain variety across tons of monsters, but still be easy to use. Also, the setting became an issue as I discovered that making a generic setting was nigh-imposssible because so much depended on the specifics.<br/>* Failure: The game failed in my opinion because I was trying for something that is at its core a paradox. The media this genre is in don't have to deal with these problems (obviously a TV show has no mechanics, and a video game can have super-complex numbers but run them all invisibly behind the scenes, something you can't do in an RPG). Also, I realized that making a setting encompassing a wide variety of shows would be impossible, since the specifics of each show were both subtly complex and highly important. <br/>* Takeaway: I learned that sometimes you need to make compromises in a design, but for this game the ones I would have needed to make would have ruined the game for me (making it story based, making it super crunchy and traditional).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_237899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237899/#Comment_237899" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-16T12:25:20+00:00" title="October 16, 2009 12:25PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 16, 2009 12:32PM by PaulB.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn you, Andy! I'm working on the same idea! My solution was to take every side and divide it into four triangles. Then each of the four triangles relates to a kind of conflict taking place: physical, social, whatever. Probably color-code each quadrant type.<br/><br/>When you're building your cube you have a budget of great-good-bad-catastrophic results you MUST put on the cube somewhere, and you can improve your good ones by taking worse ones, that sort of thing. Then you roll and physically match up edges to your opponents. I'm also messing with giving yourself EXTRA quadrants in certain kinds of conflict in exchange for losing quadrants in other kinds of conflict. If you don't have a matching conflict quadrant, the other side automatically defines victory. <br/><br/>Idea isn't dead yet. The biggest hurdle I see if that it's hard, maybe impossible, to change information on the cube itself once it's built.<br/><br/>Actually on-topic to the thread:<br/><br/>Name: my last two game contest entries.<br/><br/>Hypothesis: Explore different semiotics of playing explicitly from a first-person perspective versus playing explicitly from a third-person perspective. Do you make different choices? Are your investment levels different? <br/><br/>Experiment: Tried this in back-to-back game design contests. I personally thought the results were interesting but actual playtest was frustrating for people who aren't me.<br/><br/>Failure: Still thinking on this. Might be a matter of habit or preference -- I think most experienced gamers have a preferred approach, and codifying when either approach is mandated falls in the same area as tightly structure scenes, tight limits on GM authority, etc. etc. That's totally a guess. The other guess is that forcing that semiotic shift doesn't actually produce any meaningful change in play. My third guess is that there's not enough structure or...expectation, I guess, built into shifting the language you use. I'm telling players to do it but they don't know why, and it feels arbitrary. <br/><br/>Takeaway: Changing human nature is hard! Srsly that's about what I got out of it. I think if there was a clearer benefit or result from going through the exercise, players might be more engaged with the idea. I think I'll do it again, but rather than having the players just bop along doing whatever they'd otherwise be doing (but doing it in first/third person), constrain the kinds of things that you can accomplish in the fiction to one voice or the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237902/#Comment_237902" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-16T13:11:02+00:00" title="October 16, 2009  1:11PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 16, 2009 1:11PM by Christian_Griffen.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Competitive Strategy RPG (this was back in 2004) where players are Evil Overlords with different types of powers that create avatars, which then interact (roleplay/fight) with each other and compete for power.<br/>* Name: Power/Evil<br/>* Hypothesis: I wanted people to play competitively against each other and get a cool roleplaying experience out of it.<br/>* Experiment: I wrote it up and posted it on the Forge.  At least three groups played it and provided feedback to me.<br/>* Failure: Because of the truly-competitive nature, narration was an afterthought.  After a while, players stopped narrating much and just rolled dice.  Roleplaying ceased.<br/>* Takeaway: I've learned that making a truly competitive game where narration matters is really much more difficult than I thought.  I haven't figured out a way to do it, because judging narration in a competitive environment is kind of a paradox.  That said, the experience led me from directly-competitive gamism to challenge-based gamism, which resulted in <i>Beast Hunters</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238113/#Comment_238113" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-19T05:12:33+00:00" title="October 19, 2009  5:12AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            * Name: Bonds - A mechanic in Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple that represented a character's feelings for another character. <br/><br/>* Hypothesis: This was supposed to model the friendships between the kids in Avatar and the boys in Stand By Me.The idea was to create a a kind of Aspect or Key that encouraged players to reference their character's relationships with and feelings for another character. As those relationships changed, that would represent the character's coming of age.<br/><br/>* Experiment: I created <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=dct676c8_177m827dqd9" rel="nofollow">a set of twelve bonds</a> and gave each some criteria  for what would forge them or break them. In other words, I superficially cribbed from Aspects and Keys.<br/><br/>* Failure: Because of that superficial cribbing, I failed to realize that there was a whole underlying infrastructure within the overall FATE and TSOY systems that made Aspects and Keys work. FATE has fate points that accumulate over time and may be spent for cool stuff. Similarly, TSOY has experience points that accumulate over time and may be spent for cool stuff.<br/><br/>Whereas in Do, I wanted a system that had a closed economy without any way to "create" currency. In Do, there is a bag with some black and white stones in it. In each turn, you draw three stones, choose which ones to keep and put the rest back into the bag. Over time, fewer and fewer stones remain in the bag, which creates a useful skeleton to form a pacing mechanic around.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out a way to adapt a stat like Aspects or Keys into Do's system without creating undue complexity. I tried a lot of options, too. If you could use Bonds to swap stone colors or add more stones, that broke the economy and the predictable pacing. Introducing a point mechanic would be grafting on a whole new limb to the system because those points would have to <i>do</i> something in a game that otherwise had no numbered stats.<br/><br/>Lastly, Bonds made narration more difficult because it gave players one more thing to have to worry about on top of how to solve the world's problems, how to avoid getting themselves in trouble, how to make the narration fit within the story's scope and mood, etc. Yet, I was in love with the idea so I kept trying to hack at it. Something had to break.<br/><br/>* Takeaway: I found another way to track character growth, so the loss of Bonds wasn't as momentous as it could've been. Unfortunately, this new method doesn't address the evolution of inter-character relationships, but that may just be one of those ideas that needs to find its own playground. I tried to cram in one too many fun ideas into one game, but made it too complicated as a result. This is a lesson I knew from board games, but story games have such broader horizons and create such fuzzier experiences that I lost focus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
