I'm wondering just why this trend came about and if it's worthwhile to even try reversing it.<br/><br/>Certainly there have been new weird western developments, like <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, so I'm not laying all the blame at <i>Deadlands</i>' doorstep.  The weird western subgenre had been around for decades before <i>Deadlands</i> even appeared on the scene.  It just seems to be the thing that drove the weird western forward in the gaming realm.<br/><br/>The thing is, though I see the appeal in weird western roleplay, I have a stronger affinity for westerns played straight.  No vampires, zombies, werewolves, Cthulhoid creatures from the outer dark... none of that.  My ideal western game hews closer to the model established by classic (and not so classic) Italo-Westerns of the late '60s, early '70s.  There's plenty of meat there, what with vicious outlaws, crooked landowners, bounty hunters, gamblers and gunfighters crossing each other's paths.  Why does it seem to interest so few players?  Or is the pull of magic and monsters just that much more powerful?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248322/#Comment_248322" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T13:12:41+00:00" title="December 23, 2009  1:12PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 23, 2009 1:14PM by Marshall Burns.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Y'know, I have a system that models Spaghetti Westerns, and has optional rules to use it to play later Westerns inspired by them but not the same as them (frex The Wild Bunch and Way of the Gun).

I know I'd be uncomfortable playing in or running a straight western game because I just don't have a solid grasp of the genre, the style, the history or any of it.  I really wanted to try Dust Devils with a friend of mine who's a fan of westerns, but I just wouldn't be able to get it "right" for him.

I'm not an expert of the history of the west, along with it's level of technology and social make up.  But once you toss in a vampire who runs a brothel and a few necromancers nobody really cares about historical accuracy.

I set up a game idea for Dust Devils that was meant to be played as a straight western with kidnapped kids and an old mine and gallons of racism to wade through (because I like to make my players uncomfortable), but I couldn't sell it to them. So I adapted it to Dread (Jenga) and added some wolf spirits and an angry river monster (basically it became my game + Beowulf + misdirection with the wolves) and suddenly I had a universal hit on my hands.<br/><br/>I even wrote the questionnaires as straight-western as possible (trying not to tip my hand as to the supernatural elements too much) and at least one player answered his questions in such a way that there was no doubt his character was secretly a werewolf.<br/><br/>For some things (WW2) one could argue that our pop culture is saturated with "straight" examples of it, and so the only really fresh imaginative territory is to add spins, but westerns have been comparatively dormant lately (other than a few examples; Deadwood, 3:16 to Yuma) so I'm not sure if the same logic applies. Perhaps we act as if it does because so much of the core element of the western was dealt with so well back in their heyday?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248561/#Comment_248561" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-25T16:56:37+00:00" title="December 25, 2009  4:56PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ludanto</cite>...

Exploring the angles of religion and exploitation of nature and industrial accidents definitely provides new turf  to tread in the Western milieu, stuff that, if anything, mad science could/would actually detract from. <br/><i>Firefly</i> is, I think, a good example of pretty equally blending two genres in such a way that there's a push-and-pull relationship between them and what they do for each other. Some episodes are very, very Western, others are pretty purely Sci Fi. If <i>Deadlands</i> does that well, kudos! But if not, you could just do some digging in odd or disturbing Wild West stories to get paydirt, and make it more interesting than another OK Corral knockoff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248569/#Comment_248569" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-25T20:43:40+00:00" title="December 25, 2009  8:43PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 25, 2009 8:45PM by John_Harper.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16251&amp;cat=0&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Dust Devils</a> is awesome.

It sounds like you've named one ( <i>The Shootist </i>comes to mind there, BTW, and maybe <i>Unforgiven</i>).<br/><br/>I mean, right now, <i>Legends of he Old West</i> seems like a better example of a western game to me than most western rpgs I've seen in that it has a core "what're we doing here?" that is answered by the system (answer: All the players have gangs of some sort; We're trying to become the biggest, baddest gang over the course of the campaign).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248587/#Comment_248587" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-26T08:56:26+00:00" title="December 26, 2009  8:56AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The classic Western has several elements, which have been subverted so often that the subversions themselves are classics. Here are is my summary:<br/><br/>* Authority  is nonexistent except through the action of strong men. These men nay be heroes and villains, but the application of violence is the only legitimate authority and the only relevant action.<br/><br/>As I say, there are plenty of subversions. Shane, a gunfighter, is almost paranoiacally respectful of a weaker rancher that he admires.  Strong women appear from time to time to take their share of the bloodbath.  As the West gets less wild, law replaces the vigilante and the vigilante often doesn't like it much, or only admires it grudgingly. And in some cases, the "strong" part of "strong men" is subverted by having a con artist or dandified "hero", often for comedic effect (Maverick, The Apple Dumpling Gang).<br/><br/>There are other implications: the natives are irrelevant except insofar as they are hostile and may project violence that threatens the heroes. (EASILY and often subverted.)<br/><br/>There's a bunch more, I might be able to think of them later, or others could chip in.<br/><br/>I loooove Westerns.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248590/#Comment_248590" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-26T09:06:16+00:00" title="December 26, 2009  9:06AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it isn't drifting things too far, I'd love to see common elements with paired common subversions.<br/><br/>The western is something I'd like to like as an rpg, but wierdly I only seem to enjoy them as movies.<br/><br/>If anyone wants to take a hack at how TV westerns or other ongoing western formats compare to films, I'd love to hear about that as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248608/#Comment_248608" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-26T13:01:37+00:00" title="December 26, 2009  1:01PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's an excellent collection of Elmore Leonard's Western stories, called <i>The Tonto Woman</i>.

Man, now I want to get those books down and reread them.<br/><br/>As for TV versus movie/novel westerns, you should be able to get a crapton of early TV westerns on DVD for very little as many of them have fallen out of copyright or were syndicated on such ridiculously cheap terms that they can be stamped out by anyone with thirty cents and a spindle of blank DVDs.  My recollection of TV westerns is that they tend to adhere to the three-act TV episodic structure very, VERY tightly, since they have to establish the status quo and return to it by the end of the episode. Of course there are exceptions: Kung Fu, naturally, and more recently, Deadwood. I don't know enough about TV history to do more than speculate, but it's possible that the TV western actually created the three-act structure of a half-hour TV show given its enormous popularity in the early days of television.<br/><br/>Radio westerns too...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248614/#Comment_248614" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-26T14:00:25+00:00" title="December 26, 2009  2:00PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first Western show I remember watching was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7e4NiDEC24" rel="nofollow">Alias Smith and Jones</a>.

Unfortunately, it can be hard collecting individuals that want to play the same game as you. Really, your only other options are to learn to pitch your game better or meeting them half way (which is a lot of what running a RPG is).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248831/#Comment_248831" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-28T08:45:20+00:00" title="December 28, 2009  8:45AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think part of the reason there is not much audience for Western Games is that it is so old hat.<br/><br/>I grew up watching the Lone Ranger on TV but that was the 60s! In the 70's Westerns got real campy. I mean "Zorro the Gay Blade"?!? Clint Eastwood's Westerns from the late 70's on are great but there are few others. The genre died with the Duke...<br/><br/>Another problem with "realistic" westerns is what realism are you shooting for? You mention spaghetti westerns but they are not real to the real west. Great movies! but not real. The real west doesn't have to be boring but people really don't know it. We've always had weird fantasies about the west. Try reading Stephen Crane's "The Blue Hotel" It shows that even in the 1890's the west wasn't real.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248835/#Comment_248835" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-28T08:54:17+00:00" title="December 28, 2009  8:54AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris, I should point out that I never said I wanted my western game to be realistic.

Virtually everyone shot the guns out of the bad guys' hands rather than killing them. This did two things: one, it let it be a kids show in an age where kids were not supposed to think anything ever really got shot, and two, it emasculated the bad guys - they could no longer project violence, thus they were irrelevant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249023/#Comment_249023" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-29T13:47:03+00:00" title="December 29, 2009  1:47PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure but I think this is my first post here.<br/>\n<br/>\nWesterns (like cop stories and gangsters and swashbuckling) kick ass, and they're perfect, unrealistic adventure RPG fodder. It doesn't need to do anything with historical gaming, actually most westerns don't give a rat's ass about real history. I don't know why people want to add supernatural stuff there, for some strange reason roleplayers don't seem to dig any high-adventure stuff without some kind of magic or punk-suffixes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DaveC" title="DaveC"><img alt="DaveC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DaveC">DaveC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249034/#Comment_249034" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-29T14:41:02+00:00" title="December 29, 2009  2:41PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One common reason why genres get weird-i-fied is that it opens up additional character niches. It becomes easier to have a party of characters who each have their distinct spotlight. In Deadlands you can have your huckster, your priest, your mad scientist, and your gunslinger, and they all have a decent system-supported chance of shining during play. If you scale it back to have only 'realistic' characters, then you have to be more creative about finding easy ways to make sure that all of the characters are distinct. Note that much of the source material with westerns is about lone protagonists, or maybe groups of two or three.<br/><br/>Now sure, you can have a game where everyone is a gunfighter and they're made distinct by their personalities, their ties to the community, their attitudes toward the natives, ad infinitum. I don't doubt that virtually anyone on this board could make that work. But if you're taking a bunch of D&amp;D players and trying to get them to play a western game, and then tell them that everybody has to be a fighter... well, I think it's understandable why games layer on the supernatural or other weird vibes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
