Very shiny.<br/><br/>Essentially, it's a system for creating CRPGs (Crawford may be trying to call them something else, but they are) in which the characters in the game are actually independent entities with meaningful motivations and responses. The idea being that you get an emergent and engaging world in which you are playing. Crawford thinks that there is a huge market for this outside of the usual gamer market; I don't see it but Crawford has an annoying habit of being right about stuff.<br/><br/>When I get some time I definetely need to have a play with this.<br/><br/>(Suitable disclaimer about lack of experience with Storytron and thus possible inaccuracies in the above)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20K" title="John K"><img alt="John K" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20K">John K</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143649/#Comment_143649" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T03:14:20+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  3:14AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2008 3:31AM by John K.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What is seems to claim is Story Now in Text Based Adventures.<br/>From reading the review and web site what it will probably achieve is Illusionism for Text Based Adventures.<br/><br/>It is basically an inference engine with a not-quite-natural language interface.<br/>I don't know if that means anything to anyone so I'll put it in layman's terms... It has a database of facts about the world and it can generate new facts about the world using some rules. The rules have to be carefully written so that a natural language system can translate them into something that a human can understand as a story. One of the rules involves getting input from the player.<br/><i>It works just like a traditional RPG, you ask the GM if you can perform an action and the GM tells you what happens.</i><br/><br/>Sadly, the GM is a set of preset rules, written by the author of the story world. To get a decent world you'll need to program in thousands of carefully prepared props, actors, stages and actions. Even when it's done you will be limited by the vision of the writer.<br/><br/>This is fascinating to me... I write game AI professionally so it ought to be, otherwise I need a new job. I have read papers about using inference engines in game AI before, so this isn't exactly new, it just promises a larger scope I'm not sure it can deliver. You'd need at least another layer of AI to write the Story World for you as it went along.<br/><br/>I'm interested in what this achieves, but I'm not expecting anything miraculous.<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>EDIT: This post's not ment to sound as cynical as it does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143656/#Comment_143656" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T05:22:49+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  5:22AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2008 5:28AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, John, I'm not sure, but I think that Crawford is claiming at least to have made somewhat of a breakthrough. As it stands now, most CRPGs have programmed responses for their characters, and these are very limited, because creating an extensive network of responses is time consuming. You have to create each one individually.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Storytron, if I understand it correctly, you don't program all responses individually. You intead program the NPC to have motivations. What then happens is that the player input in the special language is parsed by the machine, and this interacts with the NPC motivations for it to determine what response you get from the NPC. <br/>\n<br/>\nThus the player can put in any sort of input at all. As opposed to most branching systems we're familiar with where you can only select from a set of things to say or do to the NPC. This is one of the primary breakthroughs. And it's not simply that each response will fall into some bucket, but that each is evaluated individually. The engine then creates an emotional response for the NPC from the wide ranges of responses it knows how to create (these cover most human emotions). <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, this alone wouldn't mean much if the NPCs only had certain set reactions. But I believe that the idea is that once given an emotional response, the machine then further comes up with something dramatic for the NPC to do to reflect that response that's based on the current game situation. So that as things change in the game world, the responses of the NPC become dynamic to the game world situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis, if it exists, is the real advance. No, you don't have to have a second level of AI writing the game as you go, because the game evolves as a TTRPG does, organically to the action at hand. When playing WoW, even if I had the ability to enter any command I wanted, the NPC would always only have a couple of programmed responses. In Storytron, you enter the motivation of the NPC, and the machine comes up with some interesting plot advancement based on what it knows about the story world. <br/>\n<br/>\nA caveat here, this is again only based on what's written about it. It's not like I've had experience with the alpha or something. It could all be BS. But I think it's an exciting step forward. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically you probably won't play in your own world, except to test it. Because knowing how you programmed it might drain out some of the suspense. Any secrets of the NPCs, for instance, are already known to you. Just as an example. But interestingly, the game does have some potential there, because you can't easily determine how it will play out given a set of moves, since there's no tree to follow. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, typically, the notion is that there will be "story world" designers who will make and even sell their worlds for others to play. these people are like authors or GMs. Other people then pick up these worlds, make a character (or play one created for the world, I'm not clear on this), and play through the story that emerges. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo... it's really not a story. It's "Story Now" insamuch as the player really is creating stuff that's being reacted to dynamically. He does, in fact, push the plot in a certain direction. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr, again, that's the theory at least. <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and to be clear, it's not quite here yet, and there could possibly be further delays: http://www.storytron.com/blog/<br/>\n<br/>\nJune 1st, if all goes well. It'll open up with the ability to get at an already created world. I think this world has been under test for a while, but opening it up will represent Beta testing, if I read correctly. So we won't have to wait for somebody to create the first story-world. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Note to people who have not seen it, it's entirely text at this point, and they're only working on getting heads of NPCs to come up to show emotional responses. Chris' feeling seems to be that a 3D interface would only add useless information. I have the feeling that, if Storytron is successful, that it'll be merged down the road with 3D interfaces. Storytron is the proof of concept for a new technology, that'll be adopted if it's actually successful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20K" title="John K"><img alt="John K" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20K">John K</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143663/#Comment_143663" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T06:08:56+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  6:08AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2008 6:24AM by John K.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike,<br/><br/>Probably didn't make myself clear. I can see the breakthrough, he's created a language that can be interpreted by an inference engine to produce human style behaviour, including emotional response. It's still a rules based system though.<br/><br/>In (for example) <i>World of Warcraft</i> a rule says 'if player within 30 yrds and I'm aggressive, attack player'.<br/><br/>In <i>Storytron</i> it's more complex. A rule says 'if I'm angry at player, if I have a weapon, if I am a violent player, if player is close by, attack player'. This introduces a huge amount of interesting interactions, for example you could be angry at the player for all sorts of reasons (governed by other rules). If you're not a violent person, maybe there's a rule where you shout at them instead. If you aren't nearby maybe you go and hunt them down.<br/><br/>If you don't make that rule, angry violent people with weapons will not attack the people they are angry at. The computer cannot deduce that this is the correct behaviour unless it is told.<br/><br/>The developers of Elder Scrolls: Oblivion tried this, but they didn't get it good enough for release (I read an article where one NPC wanted to rake some leaves, so he killed his neighbour to get a rake).<br/><br/>My point is, each NPC must be created in advance. Each motivation, each rule and action but be created first. You are free to direct the story, but only within the confines set up by the world designer. It is a simulationist sand box, not a place for stories (in a narritavist premise addressing way) to happen.<br/><br/>It's not a new idea or a giant leap forwards, but it hasn't been implemented well yet, so while it isn't the first system to explore this, maybe Storytron will be the first successful implimentation and at least a step forwards in game AI.<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>P.S. I don't see it having any appeal as a text based system, especially given how limited computers are at producing an unscripted narrative. Creating a regular game and bolting this on to create more realistic behaviour is the way I see this going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143673/#Comment_143673" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T08:06:11+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  8:06AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2008 8:16AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was of the opinion that much of the "branching" statements your talking about don't have to be created in this system. Instead of you selecting all of the conditions that have to be met, the engine already has this programmed into it. <br/>\n<br/>\nImagine, if you will, that there's only one NPC, with all of the possible reactions programmed in. The variables, then, are not what the reactions are, but the inputs. If the only input were the player's input, all NPCs would react the same. But the author's input, I believe, is to select from a set of NPC motivations. These in combination, are what trigger the various potential clauses. Given the cross-product of the number of choices that are available, this means that a character with just a few motivations quickly becomes distinct from others. Not just in terms of the "color" choice of what object it might value, etc. But simply in terms of the number of combinations (permutations) of motivations that are available. <br/>\n<br/>\nLike, let's say you select "Greedy" as an NPC motivation. The engine knows that when presented with money or other economic incentive, that the Greedy NPC will have a favorable reaction, perhaps approving whatever request that is coded into the command line. Like "Pay 100 to Pass Guard." The parser reads the part about giving the money, notes the guard's greed, gives him the "satisfied" emotion, and then accepts the second part of the clause. The engine does the detecting for suitable value or whatever, as relates the greed motive. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the greed motive is attached to an item, like "Greed Food" then that's what'll be particularly valued by that character. Yes, you do have to "program" the NPCs, but I think that you don't have to program all possible actions you want for them to possibly take. The engine deals with extrapolating them from the motivations selected. It accompishes this by assigning an emotional response to a given stimulus as that stimulus interacts with the character's motivations. And then it figures out something dramatic to have happen from that emotional state and the situation, so that you don't get neighbors killing each other for rakes. I also get the impression that these dramatic things they do are not deterministic, either. So while they may be in a range of behaviors, we might not be able to predict them with 100% accuracy. If a character gets the violent emotion, they might respond by attacking you, or they might go and attack somebody else. Perhaps interacting with their "Behave Bold" or "Behave Cowardly" motives. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI could be over-reading, certainly, and all of my examples are pure, pure speculation. Maybe this is what they want us to think it's like, and then we'll get the old bait and switch, and it'll turn out to be exactly what you're predicting. In any case, I'm sure it's got limits. But unless they're blowing smoke up our collective skirts, it's supposed to have features we have not yet seen. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20K" title="John K"><img alt="John K" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20K">John K</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143677/#Comment_143677" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T08:22:24+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  8:22AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I got the impression from reading the user manual that we would get a toolkit, rather than completed NPCs waiting for a motivation. You have to worry about genre and setting when determining appropriate actions.<br/><br/>In a political game a set of motivations and actions may cause heated debate, while in an action game it may trigger a gunfight. In a roman political game it may be appropriate to assassinate your enemies, in a modern political game it's unlikely.<br/><br/>From this, hopefully you can see that to make an agent act appropriately you need much more than motivation, to the point where you may as well write it from scratch if you want a decent game. I'm not saying you have to program each action into each NPC, more that you need to have a central pool of appropriate actions that all NPCs can use (given the right traits).<br/><br/>This is mostly speculation though, since we haven't been given anything substantial to look at. It may also be coloured by my own ideas on the subject, I've given quite a bit of thought to making 'Plot AI' so maybe I'm just a little disappointed this isn't it.<br/><br/>John,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143743/#Comment_143743" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T12:15:34+00:00" title="May 13, 2008 12:15PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looking at the documentation, it appears to be a human-readable fuzzy logic system (plus a rules engine, as John pointed out) for human interaction. You're a bit of a slave to the way he has modeled it. That is, your game inherits many assumptions that Storytron has made about how humans act. It beats programming all those assumptions yourself, but I didn't see a way to override any core behaviors with custom behaviors.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also not fond of their "write locally, run remotely" paradigm. If my Internet connection is down, I can't run my game. The engine runs on the Storytron server. I have to upload my story (and the intellectual property associated with it) to the Storytron server. I'd like more control over it. Maybe he'll license the server to serious parties.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe manual reads like one of those RPGs that has a lot of Capitalized Terms but hasn't figured out what to Do With Them yet. I suspect the manual isn't as good as the language. I can't tell yet how well it supports user-defined libraries and code reuse, which is a make-or-break thing for a serious story designer. I want to create, reuse, and share behaviors, events, objects, and world models.<br/>\n<br/>\n(My background: I have been developing and running a small text-based, role-playing-focused MMORPG for 11-12 years.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143751/#Comment_143751" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T12:54:39+00:00" title="May 13, 2008 12:54PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The manual is, apparently, still a work in progress.

It uses a version of the English language without filler words and greatly simplified grammar both as an input and feedback system. A properly designed "story" can indeed appear to contain realistic, intelligent-seeming actors by constraining both available language and forms of interaction - sort of like decreasing video resolution can make a heavily made-up actress look naturally gorgeous.<br/><br/>A neat idea, and infinitely extensible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143828/#Comment_143828" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T20:50:23+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  8:50PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Version 7 is magnificently different from previous versions.

It may be deterministic, but I hope it's actually dynamic. Else what's the point of having many emotional states? <br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully what he's calling "dramatic" is something that creates a choice for the player.

However the computer selects a list of valid reactions for the protagonist and the human controller selects them from a list.

He calls this something different though -- Fate -- thinking that the drama manager term (popular in this field generally, see the game <i>Facade </i>for example) is too clinical or something. <br/><br/>Basically with Storytron the author adds many verbs (I think Crawford says the minimum for a successful storyworld is 1000+) and the player and NPCs utilize these verbs in conjunction with their emotional and mental states to create the story. The thing that puts me off of Storytron is the presentation. I can't wait to try it, because right now the presentation language (the narrative of the story, such as it is) just looks hopeless. Furthermore this presentation is a cornerstone of Crawford's whole system, so I don't know how someone would profitably change it. <br/><br/>Inform 7 is pretty much a completely different medium, so comparing it to Storytron is kind of like comparing Neverwinter Nights to Storytron. Not that it can't be done, but it's difficult. It's going to give you a much more traditional interactive fiction experience in most cases -- though of course the range there is huge.

That's not a part of the definition at all. Kickers, yes. Those are "bangs that start the game off." But they're just a technique that one can do without. Bangs are created either by the GM, or by the player in terms of the ramifications of the decisions they make. When all is said and done, a bang can be defined as "a decision that the player must make, but which has more than one fun outcome, allowing the player to be creative in making the decision." <br/>\n<br/>\n"Fun Outcome" is the tough part. Basically the decision actually has to cause play to go off in the direction they started. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yeah, I'm with Mikael, I think that from what I've read that I'll be theoretically possible to create bangs. <br/>\n<br/>\nHell, you can do it with scripting, too. NPC gives two options, go north to fight orcs or south to fight trogs. That's a bang if it's a decision of consequence to the character. That's the more subtle part of the definition of bangs, that once the decision is made in a bang, something about the character is revealed. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is "plot" in the literary sense. Which revealing choices the protagonists make in response to the situation of the fiction. And it's this which we seek to do in play. To actually have play branch off in any possible direction based on the myriad interesting choices we could make. <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that Crawford is right that it varies from "Choose Your Own Story" branching, not only in terms of the number of branches being much greater. But in that there's no set outcomes (which often make "Choose Your Own Story" books "gamism" based... you're trying to figure out how to get to the good ending). Yes, the story ends on some trigger, just to have an end. But what the state of things are at the end of a Storytron game will vary widely, I think. Practically infinitely. Instead of pre-programmed outcomes. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, OK, in my game when we the Evil Duke died, my character had joined him in his rebellion. In your game, when he died, you killed him. Player input leading to entirely different dramatic outcomes. Every player's outcome somewhat different based on the decisions made along the way. That's what we're after. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe theory behind it is actually very simple. It's like a dungeon. Yeah, there may well be limits to the dungeon, outside of which you're no longer playing the dungeon. But inside of the very simple limits of the dungeon, there are an infinite number of ways that we can approach it. We can go down the first corridor cautiously. Or we can run down it pel mel. Or we can search for traps. Or we can blow our horn to scare the creatures of the dungeon first. Or... well that's just the first corridor. <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically what I'm hoping we have here, is a system that responds exactly like World of Warcraft does to your exploration of a dungeon. Basically allowing your control of the character to have impossibly minute effects on the outcome. Do I stop to drink some to get mana back before the next group of baddies? Or conserve my resource? How much? Do I activate one of my trinkets early in this fight? Late? Not at all? A thousand decisions to make, which, in combination have a nigh infinite potential for creating independent results. Some may be similar, even very similar. But the player had agency in making that outcome, and that's the important thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe inputs are infinite, and the outputs are as well. Each fight, each dungeon delve has at the very least minor differences in outcome, and often quite major (did we wipe? Why!?) Even when the dungeon itself is quite "linear." <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with storytelling systems to date is that they try to control the outcome of each action individually, instead of coming up with a "Physics model" and allowing the permutations of action to create variability. Hopefully Crawford's system allows that same variability of input, and "physics model" of emotion and drama that allows us to have very different experiences in encountering a story based on the player input. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20K" title="John K"><img alt="John K" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20K">John K</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143921/#Comment_143921" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T08:03:30+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  8:03AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2008 8:10AM by John K.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, got my terms in a twist (got bangs and kickers muddled).<br/><br/>Bangs looks possible, but then they are easy to pre-program already.

"appropriate ending" is not neccessary. Oh, sure, it'd be fun to ensure that the ending was powerfully dramatic in getting all of the loose threads tied up in interesting fashion. But that's not a requriement for me, at least. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the interesting fact. We don't really want a story at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet that sink in. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we want is the ability to create plot points that have real effects. Not just tactical effects like in WoW, but thematic effects. Did I just kill that man? Fine, now his family swears a blood feud on mine. The decision to kill the man, what it says about my character is thematically interesting, and the ramifications are dramatic, becuse they ask, "And what do you do about that now?"<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't care if the game never ends. Could be like a soap opera, for all I care, going on endlessly. I don't want a three act play. I simply want for my character's choices to be thematically interesting in terms of the ongoing shifting of the situation of play. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the paradigm of RPG play, and that's what we're trying to replicate. Not actual literature.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo this extent the Sims is actually pretty close. We simply would prefer that instead of a "realism model" (which the Sims make an interesting attempt at that says as much about us by it's failure as it's success), is a "drama model." Where instead of boring realistic things happening as the results of our actions, things occur which constantly ramp up the stakes for the characters. So, instead of my character getting slapped by the lover he's jilted, he now has to face the fact that she's threatening my new lover. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20K" title="John K"><img alt="John K" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20K">John K</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143941/#Comment_143941" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T08:50:45+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  8:50AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2008 8:52AM by John K.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We're talking cross purposes then I feel, I was after a system that produces an interactive story, with a beginning, middle and end, which explores a theme and wraps up nicely at the end.<br/><br/>From the looks of things, Storytron should deliver what you want quite easily (well, it'll still take hundreds of hours to create a decent world).

One example from the following article is "Running into an ex-husband at the movie theater with his new wife".<br/><br/><a href="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3167001" rel="nofollow">http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3167001</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144041/#Comment_144041" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T14:42:12+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  2:42PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, like, has anyone downloaded it and tested it yet? I did. There are two sample worlds.<br/><br/>The ChitChat story world isn't done yet. I couldn't make heads or tails of the damned thing. It was buggy. It's basically a bar and you interact with people. It's not clear what your goal is -- or, worse, what it could be.<br/><br/>The Balance of Power story world seems much better than ChitChat. Balance of Power is an old geopolitical game released on a variety of platforms by Mindscape, starting in the mid-1980's. He's basically just ported this over to Storytron. In fact, I suspect Storytron's design was heavily influenced by design problems in Balance of Power on previous platforms, as the game involves making lots of political decisions and seeing how they affect the "mood" of other countries. I fooled around with the BoP story world and was pretty easily able to have the U.S. live happily ever after, solve the Iraqi terrorism problem through medium sanctions and E.U. and Russian support, and keep Iran from getting involved. (Eat me, George Bush.) It was only vaguely fun.<br/><br/>The game interface presented by Storytron seems to be Deikto words. Essentially, it's a dumbed-down version of English syntax, presented as a computerized version of Mad Libs. That is, the sentence might say "[I] [perform some action on] [a country]." Those [brackets] mean there are three clickable boxes. I click on [I] and it tells me who I am but offers no other choices. I can't change that one. I click on [perform some action on] and it gives me a drop-down with a few choices like "bomb," "sanction," and "negotiate with." I click on [a country] and it gives me a drop-down box with all the countries that make sense for whatever I chose as my action (usually all of them in this game). If I somehow create an invalid sentence, it tells me it's a dead end and I have to change stuff.<br/><br/>I find the Deikto interface extremely counter-intuitive. While it is my dream that someday I will tell my computer in English what I want it to do, I do not want to have to do so through drop-down boxes and the mouse. I don't really even want to type it, though this does eliminate the guessing game that players of text-based games like Zork had to tolerate (e.g., is it "get box", "pick up the box", "give me the shoes", or "lift cardboard carton"?). The Deikto Words interface tells me the vocabulary that is valid at any point in time.<br/><br/>At certain points in Balance of Power, it spit out large amounts of useful information. Hover over the country name "Iraq" and get Crawford's editorial on why the country is so fucked up, for example. The game also has some maps. <br/><br/>I suspect that, like ChitChat, Balance of Power is also not complete. It's just not a very entertaining interface. The game might be fun if there were more feedback so you'd know what was going on when you made little changes to policy. I think the original games produced world newspaper headlines to give you that feedback. I didn't see these here. The primary feedback mechanism seems to be advanced smiley faces that show you how people feel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144045/#Comment_144045" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T14:54:18+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  2:54PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2008 2:54PM by lachek.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neither game is complete, though BoP is at least playable.<br/><br/>Once I figured out the interface, I was very happy with how it worked in play, compared to the numerous menu-driven IF systems I've seen. Its context-sensitivity works well (I never managed to construct an invalid sentence??).<br/><br/>I do believe there are some unnecessary limitations to the interface, though - like choosing the "intensity" of an action by picking a word between "super-tiny" to "ultra-large" with a dozen intermediate terms. A slider would have been nicer.<br/><br/>Some sort of customizable status window would also be nice, and could solve the feedback problem you're talking about, Adam. I think in BoP, the lack of feedback is a feature - you can get information by requesting a country to reveal it, but it shouldn't be available at your fingertips. Other games would not benefit from having such an obscure feedback mechanism, though.<br/><br/>I assumed everyone who commented about it here had tried it already. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144049/#Comment_144049" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T15:01:41+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  3:01PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The BoP that you describe might be an incomplete and dumbed down example (I hope), but it does not sound like particularly interesting, or new (or even new-ish).

The hope is that the version released then is not just the one we're seeing plus two weeks of work, but that there's a more complete version that's waiting to be revealed on June 1st. So I don't know that evaluating it by what we're seeing now is going to do a lot of good. It certainly gives an idea of what it's supposed to do, but the release version may have a lot of changes. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe not. We'll see.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case... let's say it's very much exactly what we're seeing now... I think that this does represent a movement forward. Perhaps not a practical game. But expecting such is, to use the analogy I'm on, like expecting prototype Fusion power plants to produce excess power. They don't right now, it takes more power to power them than they produce. But does that stop folks from making them? No, we make them as steps along the path to getting the actual productive parts going. <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, he's marketing it like it's going to be a full, fun to play project. And I think it won't be totally devoid of practical use. But, again, I think that this is a prototype that he hopes will get more money, and thus designers, behind the project so he can make the "real" version someday. <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, this is a problematic approach in the video game industry, where there are billions to be made putting out a retread of last year's best FPS. But I'm not seeing another option. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144213/#Comment_144213" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T12:27:35+00:00" title="May 15, 2008 12:27PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike:<br/><br/>So, what you're sort-of expecting here is a <i>deeply informative</i> failure?<br/><br/>Because, well, I can dig that.
