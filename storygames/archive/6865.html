And because I long for the familiar charm of the "future" and some of the players don't know Shadowrun yet (!!!11!one!!!), I decided it's time for Spirit of the Sixth Age.<br/><br/>Now, chances are, somebody has already thought of that and I fully expect a complete conversion to turn up two minutes after posting that, even though a quick google search didn't turn up anything except an episode of 2d6 feet in a random direction (Which I'm listening to now.), so don't disappoint me. ^_^<br/><br/>But, anyway, in the unlikely case that the internet has not already produced what I want to read now, here are a couple musings by a SotC noob:<br/><br/>For a generic Shadowrun gam, I'd probably have the following phases in character creation:<br/><br/><b>Background:</b> Basic Stuff, where do you come from, and so on. Not much change there.<br/><b>The Fall/The Shadows:</b> Nobody is born a Shadowrunner and there's a story there. Where you born in the gutter and started crawling upwards? Did you start out in the glittering castles of AAA and then fell? Got backstabbed by a coworker? Framed for a crime you didn't commit? Whatever it is, this phase explains why you started running.<br/><b>The Run people heard about:</b> In Shadowrun, reputation might not be everything, but it sure is important. So here it's all about the one run people remember you for. What happened? Was it your first one, showing you as a natural through huge success? Did you totally fuck it up and now nobody wants to work with you now?<br/><b>Followers:</b> This is again the basic Guest Role part. Think up situations where you met and worked with/for/against/next to one of the other characters in their Big Runs. Maybe you where the Security Guard he shot in the ass, maybe you where the one that drove him home afterwards or whatever.<br/><br/>Now, the rules should easily cover most of the stuff in Shadowrun, especially with a couple of the other conversion to steal liberally from. (Like some stunt for Mysteries to make ranged attacks for magicians, ...) Maybe have some "Cyber" Skill that covers cyber-repair, hacking and so on? Dunno, not sure. <br/><br/>Anybody tried that yet? Any comments or ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152881/#Comment_152881" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T07:27:11+00:00" title="June 25, 2008  7:27AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that idea is made of awesome.

Maybe the second one would be: The one <i>nobody</i> heard about -- why not? Did something go terribly wrong? Were the stakes really that high? The third one? Dunno.

The most obvious would be that the technical specifications of cyberware would become pretty moot. The gadget rules already undermine a techie-specific focus, much to the chagrin of the gearhead(s) in my own play group. So that'd be something to pay attention to. Personally, I would LOVE to move SR away from gear and tech specs, so that's a-okay by me.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I'd say Gear = Aspect (or stunt, if you're using the Gadget rules from SotC and need a multifaceted piece of Gear. I'm not sure how I'd differentiate it). Each thing or integrated system would be an Aspect. I would also tightly restrict this, again to force focus back on characters and not on gear. Some additional thoughts: Out of your 10 total traits, I'd say no more than 3x Gear (unless you open up more of them with a Stunt, but that creates kind of a chicken-and-egg problem during character creation), <i>at least</i> 2x Aspects tied to other characters in your crew, a minimum 1x Aspect related to your character's relationship with magic, maybe 1x Aspect related to your character's race if non-human, etc. Not to tie them all up or anything; just giving character creation some shape.<br/><br/>Second, I'm pretty sure five stunts would be totally fine for a SR character...assuming the stunts are broad in their application. Also, there's that change in focus thing again -- instead of modeling everything a Runner can do, you're modeling the things the runner can do that actually matter to the story at hand. In my game at least, the stunts would be fundamental expressions of the character as well.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152922/#Comment_152922" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T10:30:22+00:00" title="June 25, 2008 10:30AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Well, moving SR over to SotC would require some fundamental changes in focus.

So it's not that I'm trying to model the way the shadowrun system treats cyberware/powers, quite to the contrary. It's just that, if you only ever get five stunts, these stunts don't seem as cool anymore. If that makes any sense...<br/><br/>But hey, this is just from reading. I haven't played this yet, so I don't know. I only know, reading the book with my player hat on that, that I saw more then five stunts there that I'd have liked. (Especially when you have to take 1 or two not-as-interesting prerequisites to get there...)<br/><br/>This was made even more obvious when I read "Spirit of IK", which is filled with TONS of interesting stunts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153000/#Comment_153000" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-25T14:57:17+00:00" title="June 25, 2008  2:57PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno...if you only get five, in my mind it makes them awfully special! Also, there's no meaningful character advancement in SotC, although I've seen some excellent ideas on how to handle character <i>development</i> (via trading in old aspects for new, kind of like trait votes a la BW). So, given the five stunts are the only five stunts you'll ever have, they'd better be pretty definitive, right?<br/><br/>If I were writing a SR hack, I'd probably start fresh, using Len's stunt guidelines, and be on the lookout for speedbump stunts -- I agree, those pretty much suck in SotC. In fairness, there aren't many of them.

Go through the five phases of chargen (Background, Time of Trouble, Novel, Guest star, Guest star).<br/>2. Players pick one Aspect for each phase, while the gm examines the Novels for villians and adventure hooks and makes appropriate notes.<br/>3. Players select 10 skills from the source rpg's skills/abilities to make a skill pyramid (One skill at +4, two at +3, etc.). Be sure to include Might and Resolve from SOTC if the source rpg doesn't have the equivalent. Non-selected skills should default to +0 for regular skills and -2 for skills deemed 'technical' like surgery or flying helicopters.<br/>4.

And it didn't really work, at least for the Stunt part. (The Phases, Aspects and skills worked nicely, though.)<br/><br/>Now, I admit the character I tried to build was not the easiest one, but I figured it was close enough to a Mesmerist to try: It was a Mage, specialised in mind-reading and manipulation. But after taking Psychic (Which fitted nicely into the whole Astral Perception thingy), all I could do to roughly approach the character was take the Mesmerist - ... -Enthrall chain, which left me with all my five stunts used up and not much closer to my shadowrun character. (Who could do a whole other bunch of stuff, at least summon spirits and kick some magical ass...)<br/><br/>Maybe SotC isn't the right thing after all. I'm wondering how this works in Dresden Files, where the character has lots of different spells at his disposal...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153094/#Comment_153094" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T07:56:52+00:00" title="June 26, 2008  7:56AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like a strong argument in favor of writing original stunts for SR, which unfortunately involves actual work.

As a noob it's hard to get a feel for how broad or narrow a Stunt is "supposed to be", but here are a couple of "groups" I could think of:<br/><br/>Magic: In Shadowrun, there are a couple of things most mges are supposed to be able to do, the biggest of which is Astral Perception, ie. seeing spirits and other magical critters, reading the aura of people to determine their emotinal state, health, whether somebody has magical talent or cyberware implanted. Some are also able to Astrally Project, ie. seperate their soul from their body to go take a look around. Some can cast spells (Of which a mage can typically learn a bunch) and/or summon spirits. And then there are Adepts, who use their magic to kick ass physically and who work differently again. <br/><br/>Now, I could see a basic "Mage" package that covers Astral Perception (Which I could see working a bit like a combination of Psychic and Hand Reading, ie. use Mysteris/Magic instead of Empathy or Investigation in specific circumstances.) and allows one to get other magical Stunts. From there on, I could see a further Stunt for Astral Projection, some sort of summonable Companion Stunt to cover summoned Spirits and Elementals and so on.<br/><br/>That still leaves me with the biggest Headache: Spells. They generally can do many different things, from frying people to reading their minds or create water. Damage spells are easy enough (Using Mystery instead of Guns) as are various defense spells (Mysteries instead of Athletics/Weapon/Fists), but how to put that into stunts without completely overpowering things OR making the things so narrow that one can only make half a mage?<br/><br/>And Cyberware... Puh. But I actually think many Aspects/Skills work quite nicely there. Enhanced Strength? Superb Might+a couple of those stunts and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153126/#Comment_153126" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T09:44:29+00:00" title="June 26, 2008  9:44AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe Aspect: Mage, with a firm understanding of what is possible when you invoke Mage for effect?

Why not take a "Mesmerist" aspect to tag for clouding the mind of your enemy or a "Bunch of Mooks" Aspect instead of Companions.<br/><br/>And yes, I realize many people play that way and that's fine. But I thought about using SotC because it had a bit more crunch to it, and just using Aspects instead of stunts makes it a bit too hand-wavey again for my taste.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153153/#Comment_153153" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-26T11:28:22+00:00" title="June 26, 2008 11:28AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh...SotC has a different kind of crunch. As far as modeling a game where characters are broadly competent in lots of unrelated things...man, I don't know how to do that. Not without tossing the SotC elements and going straight to the Fate3 engine. Define your own stunts, define the number of stunts, and so on.<br/><br/>And some people DO play Fate with aspects only, no stunts. It's not totally crazy, although it's pretty loose and everyone has to have a firm idea of what's possible to invoke/compel. Your gearheads will throw up if you try it.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
