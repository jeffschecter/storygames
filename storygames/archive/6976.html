We've learned that it's difficult to prepare effective encounters for three-player groups, for example, since the game is optimized for four.  <br/><br/>Personally, I'm quite interested in discovering things it does well and poorly.  Sometimes outcomes are unsatisfying in situations that, in other games, would probably be pretty cool.  The system's ability to handle off-the-wall ideas relies on the GM's largesse and inspiration to a huge degree, so trying something that isn't a known quantity can be really wonderful or a complete waste of time, depending on the GM's call.  Call me a baby; I'm not really used to that.  <br/><br/>Conversely, sometimes working within the structure of the game produces results that you wouldn't imagine otherwise.  Last night the three halfling Cranwinkle brothers and their two goblin henchmen were throwing down with a white dragon, a pretty badass foe.  We were churning through all our daily and encounter powers trying to make a dent in the thing's frosty hide.  My halfling guy is a Rogue, and he has this power called Topple Over.  It reads "Target: One Creature".  So I turn up the Man-O-War soundtrack in my head, rush the dragon, make a DX vs. AC roll, succeed, and knock the thing on its reptilian ass.  It was a satisfying moment for me, and it never would have happened outside the framework of the game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_155333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155333/#Comment_155333" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-08T05:44:36+00:00" title="July  8, 2008  5:44AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This came up in my bi-weekly gaming group the other day, regarding not being able to get off one's daily powers (to which I retorted that if everyoone at the table did an "Aid Another", that means that the person using the ability gets (usually) around a +10 to do the task, which is a great levelling device: Take that "need to roll 16 or higher" down to "need to roll 6 or higher".<br/><br/>However, it doesn't scale to games of less than 6 players.  So here's my fix:<br/><br/>=====<br/>So, there's this rule that's really easy to overloook, that I believe<br/>even solves my own problems I had with my warlord: Aid Another.<br/><br/>A member of your team describes how they are helping you, then makes<br/>an attack roll against difficulty 10 (this is pretty easy to beat). If<br/>you succeed, you add +2 to another's roll.<br/><br/>I had times where I got bum results for dailies and encounter powers<br/>that were powerful, but I realized that all we needed to do was to all<br/>chip in and the others could have given me up to a +10 bonus (with 5<br/>others) to make it work. That, I believe, pretty much fixes my<br/>percieved problem.<br/><br/>Thing is, I often roll with far fewer members. So I made a house-rule<br/>adjusting Aid Another depending on how many people there are, giving<br/>it a standard of a plus 10 to 12 (all the players, minus the one being<br/>aided).<br/><br/>So with two players, Aid Another grants +10<br/>3 players, +5<br/>4 players, +4<br/>5 players, +3<br/>6 players and on: +2<br/>=====                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_155335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/155335/#Comment_155335" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-08T05:58:23+00:00" title="July  8, 2008  5:58AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only time we Aid is in skill challenges, Andy, and then for the straight +2 each.

I imagine it'd be way harder with three strikers or three leaders. We've got a paladin, a rogue, and a cleric, and that combo's been very effective when we work together.<br/><br/>I'm playing the paladin, and I love the defender role to death. It is great. I'm probably the worst hitter - the cleric's a little more optimized for punching it up - but I screw up big monsters terribly. At level 4, my AC is 22 (24 vs opportunity attacks), and we have various ways to bump that even further up. I'm almost impossible to hit - and when the DM manages to, I have the halfling second chance encounter power. I can challenge a big creature and force it to attack me - which will fail - or attack someone else with penalties and take damage.

A level one rogue with a 16 dex (low average) and a dagger (+4 proficiency) hits on an 11.  Add flanking (which the rogue should aim to get every round), and a +3 (low average) from a Warlord's "Furious Smash" - an at-will power, and you're hitting on a 6+.
