Potentially flame-way material is usually easy to spot by a high post count in a short period. However, in this new forum software there is a built-in method for reporting posts you believe are problematic so that we can spot and address them.<br/><br/>Next to someone's post's name, there are a few small words written: Quote, Edit (if it's your post), and <b>Flag</b>. Flag is the  one you click on to report a post.<br/><br/>A pop-up window will appear to ask you the reason you find the post problematic. Please write a detailed description of the problem you find here (later we might have a template we'll ask you to fill out just to make sure everything is super clear, but for now just be verbose). A sentence or two will suffice. "This is bullshit" or "Look at this asshole" isn't as useful in a subjective post (but "double post, please delete" is fine, since there's no interpretation there).<br/><br/>Please use this feature if you think that someone's post is problematic. Namely the Big Three:<br/><b>Racism<br/>Sexism<br/>Homophobia</b><br/><br/>Or else <b>Bullying</b>. <br/><br/>...but if you see other extremely problematic behavior, please Flag that post and tell us what you find problematic about the behavior.<br/><br/>Also, flag a post if you find a technical problem with it: The format of the post is breaking the forums, or you made a double-post by accident.<br/><br/>What happens then: All moderators get a direct email about your post, and it goes in an internal queue we can see and respond to. We'll then act (maybe thinking for a while before acting, but acting nonetheless), usually in private. We'll then make sure to tell at least you that the item was acted upon, or make a public post if it concerns many people. If it's a simple technical thing like deleting a double-post, we'll just go in and kill the post for you, no response given.<br/><br/>This is a new feature, and we haven't tested it out thoroughly, so please excuse us as we get used to it. After the first few uses, we'll probably need to edit the rules surrounding flagging posts to make the process faster and easier for everyone involved, but we plan on evolving.<br/><br/>Thanks again for your support.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
