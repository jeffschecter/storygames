The name and the art made me uncomfortable, the uncharitable descriptions I'd heard about a game of sex and monsters made it seem like it wouldn't be for me. And the art: it definitely seemed like a game where you fucked monsters to death (though whose death was unclear). I hung out a lot at Ron and Vincent's booth at GenCon, because they're cool people and Design Matters kept kicking me out. Finally, one time I dropped by, Ron grinned and held up his game, and said "Let's play!"<br/><br/>For all of the preconceived notions I mentioned earlier, I was extremely reluctant. Eventually I went "eh, what the hell" and decided to trust Ron and play, figuring I could bail if the game made me uncomfortable. And dude.<br/><br/>Dude. That game.<br/><br/>It is the most instantly-evocative, nuanced, fascinating fantasy storytelling game I've ever seen. You take turns being "You" (the hero) and "I" (the world). You've got a colorful past and you're in this incredibly amazing setting that is crystal-clear even though it's only been described in a sentence or two. I play a monster trying to kill you, and a lover trying to keep you. Everything else is collaborative. With Ron, I chose "I slew men to win my freedom, but never again" as my hero's history, and we played in "The last remaining holy place of the first god." When I ran it for Dev in the car ride home, he chose "I am a scholar, my mind spinning with lore and insight, but I can kill if I must" and we played in "The secret world contained within the Mad Lord's final spell." HELL YES.<br/><br/>Oh, and that's the other thing. The rules and procedures are so simple and iconic that, having played it once, I felt the same level of fluency with the game that I do with games I've played the heck out of and loved for years. I'd be more comfortable running S/lay w/me for someone than Apocalypse World, for example, and I've been playing Apocalypse World on a near-weekly basis since late summer 2008. Shreyas and I have been trying to write a game together that does what S/lay does for years, and after I showed him how S/lay works, he basically said "Oh. So that's how it's done."<br/><br/>I don't really write many reviews or advocate for many games, but I just wanted to put this out there. I know there are other people with the same preconceived ideas that I had, and I just wanted to let you know: you're seriously missing out if you don't give this game a second look.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285388/#Comment_285388" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T06:11:15+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  6:11AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very good game.

I showed up in an impossible-to-get-to valley between two craggy mountain peaks, and found a serene temple in the middle of brambles and ash. There was the body of my wife, lying on a stone slab, and three hooded figures circling the temple and chanting. As I approached, my wife\u2014 clearly dead and cold\u2014 opened her eyes to look at me, and the hooded figures with feminine faces and reptilian eyes began to chant everything that had happened in my life, all the atrocities and times I'd left, all from the perspective of my dead wife. I looked down at my hands as they began to wither with old age; it was clear that when the chanters hit the present day I would die. Meanwhile, my wife is reaching out to me, cold, slightly inhuman, clearly dead but not zombified or anything. And as she touched my face, her body began to warm. <br/><br/>I picked up one of the reptilian women and threw her into the others, knocking them down and disrupting the chanting. My wife begged me to take her away from all of this; I scooped her in my arms as if carrying her over the threshold after our wedding, stepped onto the edge of the top temple stair, and threatened to throw her to her second death if she didn't explain herself. The reptilian women opened a deep hole in the earth, bringing the crumbling ruins of the temple with them, and pulling me deep into the ground. On the surface, my wife wailed and wept, but she never sounded human.<br/><br/>(That was the end of the match. We rolled our dice to find out outcomes, and then I had to choose the outcomes I wanted. But here's the thing: if you don't choose something, then the opposite occurs. So I chose "i reach my goal" and "I am safe from harm," but because I did not choose to save the Lover, my wife was automatically toast.)<br/><br/>So I climbed out of the pit, fingernails cracked and bleeding, leaving the reptilian women to suffocate beneath the earth. I went to embrace my wife, who reached out to me sadly, only to see a tooth fall out, a clump of hair blow away in the wind, and watch her decompose into nothingness. The first god was nowhere to be found, and I was still without answers.<br/><br/>I climbed the tallest mountain peak and found a strange place: this was the true cradle of the first god. Storms raged around us, the hollow of the mountain was polished smooth and incredibly ancient. Before me was a strange, overwhelming light, shifting in colors I did not know existed. There was a faint humming noise. I kneeled as if in deference, then drew my sword and walked directly into the pulsating heart of the first god.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285417/#Comment_285417" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T07:26:26+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  7:26AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            gagaga                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285418/#Comment_285418" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T07:34:00+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  7:34AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2010 7:34AM by nemomeme.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is one weird vignette, Elizabeth.

What pieces told you "this isn't for you," or more precisely, gave you the wrong impression on what the game was about?  I tried to go with Ron's theme of "phantasmagoria, monsters, nakedness" but it was all done very quickly, on a last-minute deadline, so I was pretty much just reaching into my brain and dropping whatever naked monstrous weirdness I found there onto the paper.<br/><br/>Ron was pretty happy with it all, so I think my work hit the mark by his standards, but if there's a way I could have achieved that and avoided turning people off of a game they'd actually have enjoyed playing, that would have been even better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285959/#Comment_285959" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-12T16:56:52+00:00" title="August 12, 2010  4:56PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ed, it's totally not the style of the art that bugged me.

I love to play it with actual girlfriend(s), but also with any friend of any gender. Never "botched" a single run: it always turns out in the pretty good to very good range. Solid.<br/>Also a very quick game, in that you can "teach" it and have your first play with a partner in less than a hour, after which you can reliably play with that same partner whenever you've got half a hour to spare. There can never be enough "short" games like this! I developed a habit to always carry my copy of <i>S/Lay w/Me</i> at gaming events and even regular parties with geek/gamer friends, since the short playing time and "scalable pace" make it a perfect filler/backup game.<br/>By "scalable pace" I mean that you can play it very leisurely and even a bit casually, but you can also make it very intense and gripping. Plus, you <i>can</i> play it very short and very quick by keeping it barebones, but you can as well enjoy taking your time, making a tale last a hour or more.<br/><br/>BTW, any human being who's not yet read Ron's essay <a href="http://adept-press.com/ideas-and-discourse/the-latest/naked-went-the-gamer/" rel="nofollow">Naked Went the Gamer</a> should.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287377/#Comment_287377" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T19:35:34+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  7:35PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the game Matthew and I played was great.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafu</cite>but you can as well enjoy taking your time, making a tale last a hour or more.</blockquote>\nIt was this!
