My puppy. Daddy's instructions.<br/><br/>It's a fairy tale game in which the main character or characters are children or young adults. The characters are learning some virtue or lesson, and this virtue or lesson is symbolized by a physical thing or reasonably tangible concept that they have forgotten to take with them - reflecting the fact that they ought to know better, but have not yet internalized this particular social norm. <br/><br/>The game is designed to be played by young children with their parents or other adults as a way to explore actions and consequences along with values and moral lessons. Other spaces on the sheet include a large box with a picture of the character to be colored in with crayon. There is a coloring book that accompanies the game with additional character sheets and unique character designs. The characters span the previously-mentioned range of ages as well as several thematic time periods, and includes some characters who are non-human (such as cartoon animals). Due to the target audience, the character sheet has little else besides spaces for a name and an age. <br/><br/>The forgotten thing informs play in several ways. Most obviously, it must be recovered for the character to have a "happy ending" that serves as an incentive for the player to emulate the character. If it is not found, then negative consequences occur to serve as a warning. Naturally, these must be appropriate to the age and temperament of the child. In addition, it provides the adult player with clues as to what sort of story to tell - a forgotten bicycle is part of a different story than a forgotten friend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dr_pete" title="dr_pete"><img alt="dr_pete" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dr_pete">dr_pete</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214102/#Comment_214102" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-23T15:52:37+00:00" title="June 23, 2009  3:52PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Make the sheet like a customs declaration form<br/>\n<br/>\nThe primary purpose of this trip is business/pleasure.<br/>\nI am carrying more than USD 10,000 or equivalent Yes/No<br/>\nI have been in close proximity to livestock recently Yes/No<br/>\nI am traveling with _____ family members.<br/>\nPlaces visited prior to arrival<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe throw other curious ones in, like:<br/>\nIs this your first visit to your destination?<br/>\nAre your intentions criminal?<br/>\nAre you currently a fugitive?<br/>\n<br/>\nSome number of these to be decided during play, as is the destination.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214105/#Comment_214105" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-23T16:28:34+00:00" title="June 23, 2009  4:28PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric,<br/>It was originally an idea for a game I'm writing that's about young protagonists stumbling into a fairy tale world and affecting its fate.<br/><br/>Pete,<br/>Cool!

Like Noah's Ark diluvian shit. The world is about to end, motherfucker, and you have five minutes to grab all the crap you can, stuff it in your car, and drive to high, safe ground.<br/><br/>The character sheet says "What did you forget to bring with you?" and has a bunch of blank lines under it. Every player, including you, must write one thing that your character forgot.<br/><br/><br/><b>What else might be on the character sheet?</b><br/><br/>"Why was it your responsibility to bring each item?"<br/>"Pick one item. Why is it simply awful that you forgot it?" <br/><br/>Also, a place for you to write a bunch of things that you DID bring, and why they are the most important things you have.<br/><br/><br/><b>What would this game be about?</b><br/><br/>Superficially, surviving a cataclysm. Under the surface, it's about what's important to us and why.<br/><br/><br/><b>What would you fill in?</b><br/><br/>Things like:<br/>* a radio<br/>* cat food<br/>* my chemistry book<br/>* my sister<br/><br/><br/><b>How can you use this piece of information (a forgotten item) to inform play and/or understanding of character? </b><br/><br/>On its face, this is an item that might be useful for play, and you don't have it. The GM can use it as a flag for creating situations that thrust your character into challenges where that item is part of the solution. You have to find a clever work-around or face the consequences for forgetting it. The consequences might be social (other people are mad that you forgot it).<br/><br/>A forgotten item also says something about the character. Why is this item an issue for the character? Why did the character possess such an item in the first place? How is the character affected by its loss? How does the character cope with that loss? Loss of an item can create a hook for play: the character can try to get it back or find a replacement. The character might return to get it, at great peril to herself.<br/><br/>There's also the question of why the character forgot the item. Was it just a mistake, or is there some Freudian passive-aggressive thing going on?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214238/#Comment_214238" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-24T14:43:17+00:00" title="June 24, 2009  2:43PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One idea:<br/><br/>The game is called Ghost Highway.<br/><i>It's Wristcutters meets Lost Highway, directed by Wes Anderson.</i><br/>The character sheet includes:<br/>"What did you forget to bring?"<br/>"Why do you secretly hate that thing?"<br/>"Who last spurned you?"<br/>"Who will spurn you next?"<br/>"How many past lives have you known that person in?"<br/>"Are you dead yet?
