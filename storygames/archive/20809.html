A classical example might be something like having a player roll for a climb check to see if the character falls into a ravine, and then deciding that the failure on the check does not, after all, mean a failure of the intention to survive - instead the character merely "clings to life" and has to be helped up by somebody else, or they need to make another check, or whatever. The opposite example might be where a character makes a task resolution check to tackle a fleeing opponent, succeeds, and then the GM (possibly bolstered by more dice rolls) decides that the enemy manages to flee anyway despite the successful tackle.<br/><br/>The above sort of thing goes on all the time in games that use explicit task resolution while intents/conflicts are resolved implicitly by GM fiat. (That's not the same as saying that all games that use task resolution also use fiat-based conflict resolution; it is eminently possible to have a task-focused game that nevertheless resolves conflicts in an even-handed manner, with little GM fiat.)<br/><br/>As for games that are explicit and intentional about this sort of thing, there certainly are some. <i>Elfs</i>, for example, separates success from intent, so you can get failed tasks that accidentally bring about positive outcomes, and vice versa. Also, any and all games that break conflict resolution down into task resolution do this - Shadow of Yesterday, Dogs in the Vineyard, Apocalypse World, even D&amp;D combat system all make it possible for a character to succeed in a task without succeeding in their intent.<br/><br/>(An interesting example from old school D&amp;D here, by the way - last week a player in our campaign decided to arrange the spearmen of the party into a fan formation several feet away from the doorway enemies were coming through. He succeeded in the task, but because he never told the GM - me - <i>why</i> he was doing it, the men were never effective in actually blocking the doorway, which was the tactical intent behind his action. In this case the game definitely supports resolving intent directly, but because the player satisfied himself with describing the action he wanted, the GM could easily misunderstand the intent, and thus the action would fail in carrying out the desired effect.)<br/><br/>In the classical analysis of this matter the difference between "action" (or "task", as many older games call it) and "intent" (or "conflict", interchangeably) is precisely in the phenomenon wherein success in an action may not bring about the consequences a character desires. To resolve a task is to resolve a fictional detail; to resolve a conflict is to resolve control over consequences. These two matters may, depending on the genre and techniques in play be all but identical, or widely divergent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456916/#Comment_456916" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-06T15:41:59+00:00" title="October  6, 2016  3:41PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero's covered it nicely.<br/><br/>There's definitely room here for variations on a theme.

Not trying to pick specifically on Earthdawn, it's probably just a flashback to when we were reading it carefully with Jason a couple years back for some reason I forget right now <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456919/#Comment_456919" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-06T17:41:51+00:00" title="October  6, 2016  5:41PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2016 5:42PM by David_Berg.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In D&amp;D3, you say "I attack the orc" and the system tells you if your attack is effective across the next six seconds of fighting.

If your end goal is to kill all orcs, you can see clearly how knocking 5 HP off this one gets you closer to that.  Ticking a segment off a progress clock in a PbtA game or Blades in the Dark is the same thing: making tangible progress is a fulfilled intent, even if there's still more to do.  Not all intents are end goals.<br/><br/>The classic complaint about action/intent incoherence is when there's no such tangible metric of progress like clocks or hit points, and whatever less formal system is used provides insufficiently clear or meaningful feedback.  For example, I stab an orc and he growls in anger and stabs me back, with no dice or points involved -- do I know from this whether orc-stabbing is a constructive way forward?  Has the GM given me enough info to tell?  If so, great, I'll do it again.  If not, then look out, because my actions may feel arbitrary and meaningless.<br/><br/>I'd say that more games put good rules with clear feedback to the stabbing than to the lying and bargaining and navigating and trap-avoiding etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Shiro" title="Shiro"><img alt="Shiro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Shiro">Shiro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456925/#Comment_456925" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-07T00:03:02+00:00" title="October  7, 2016 12:03AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played in more than one game (D&amp;D, or superhero games in the 90's if memory serves) where I've seen the GM grant "greater success" on a critical roll that's invalidated the original intent.<br/><br/>For example, wanting to knock someone over to prevent them from acting, but rolling "so well" that you push them off a cliff, or they hit their head on a rock and die. I didn't play it much, but I think the old Marvel FASERIP game may have been prone to this, since getting a "really good" result with a Lethal attack could kill people even if you didn't intend to.<br/><br/>On a couple of occasions I've had to suggest to GMs that, if a character succeeded, but the "success" is as good as failure... is that really a success?<br/><br/>As a GM I've also seen the thing where the player describes some convoluted procedure at great length without explaining what they hope to achieve. I usually cut through it and ask what they're actually trying to do. I wonder if this sort of Cover Your Ass concealed information style comes from more adversarial GM/player "gotcha"-style play, where you want to make sure you have your bases covered but don't trust the GM not to engineer an end-run around your prep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456928/#Comment_456928" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-07T11:19:56+00:00" title="October  7, 2016 11:19AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2016 12:03PM by Rickard.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anon: isn't this a fail forward mechanic or am I missing something?<br/><br/><i>You manage to lock pick  the door but guards arrives.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456930/#Comment_456930" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-07T14:49:50+00:00" title="October  7, 2016  2:49PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Anon: isn't this a fail forward mechanic or am I missing something?<br/><br/><i>You manage to lock pick  the door but guards arrives.</i></blockquote>\nNo, not really.

If there's absolutely nothing you can do about the bars, then picking the lock was a useless waste of time and leaves a bad taste.  The next task to come up may be attempted with less enthusiasm.  If you can do something about the bars, then we're probably fine, unless the player really thought picking the lock would get them into the room right away.<br/><br/>At times I've pondered attaching hit points or pie slices / countdown clocks to every task the characters ever attempt to do that isn't one-and-done.

I skimmed the PHB as well a bit out of curiousity, but of course this sort of thing might be in the DMG as well. I have some vague memory of there being instructive text there about how the DM is supposed to judge tasks that do not fall clearly into one of the well-defined skill usages listed in the PHB.<br/><br/>D&amp;D 3rd edition is actually interesting in this regard, because you know, it builds upon the old school task resolution scheme of non-universal rules application (that is, each different task may potentially have its own procedures for resolution - for more pure-bred examples see early '80s games like WFRPG or 2300 AD or such), which makes it basically a forerunner of Apocalypse World in many ways - AW calls them "moves", D&amp;D calls them "skill actions", but the thing is the same. Those who think that Apocalypse World doesn't suffer from this issue might well consider why and how D&amp;D3 does <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>The answer lies, of course, in how, exactly, one gets from intent to task in a system like this. It is entirely possible that the GMing practices encouraged by D&amp;D and those advocated by AW result in different outcomes, even if the task-based resolution scheme is identical. For example, the D&amp;D DMG might (hypothetically, I don't have a 3rd edition DMG at hand right now) encourage the GM to undermine intents to preserve tension in scenes, while the AW GMing principles might (again, hypothetically) outright require the GM to ensure that intent is clearly captured by whatever tasks the characters are called to perform. If, due to how the game text is written, the same mechanical conceit is applied differently, that would explain why the outcomes come to differ so occasionally.<br/><br/><i>Solar System</i>, to pick a lateral example, also utilizes task resolution as part of the conflict resolution system, just like D&amp;D and AW. SS ensures that intent gets respected by the classical Forge method of declaring intent: the players participating in the conflict define conflict stakes at the beginning, before tasks are picked and dice are rolled, and this creates a strong expectation that whatever tasks are ultimately picked for execution, those tasks will be considered a posteori to have fulfilled the requirements of achieving the intent agreed-upon beforehand. This pre-declaration makes it very difficult for the GM to undermine intent compared to the traditional conflict flow, which is why it became popular in Forgite games a decade ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456950/#Comment_456950" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-07T19:00:18+00:00" title="October  7, 2016  7:00PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>You know, I actually went back and looked at the text of the D&amp;D3 Player's Guide and I can't find anywhere where it says players can just announce they are doing anything they want.</blockquote>I think you're one edition too late.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>Also, in what way is opening an empty safe not achieving your intent?

A very economical way to achieve a very dramatic change in gaming technique.<br/><br/>As for the difference between Apocalypse World and D&amp;D, it lies in the construction of the "moves". The description of D&amp;D rolls is all about carrying out the task in the fictional environment; the general understanding (and I believe the text supports this fully) is that the die roll, combined with appropriate modifiers, represents <i>how skillfully the character carried out a task</i>. It's very easy to separate this, conceptually, from various possible outcomes or consequences. The purpose of the roll is fundamentally <i>descriptive</i>, in my experience, according to the people playing. ("A high roll! You must have done that thing *really well*.")<br/><br/>Apocalypse World does a few things differently:<br/><br/>* First of all, it makes it quite clear that, conceptually, the roll is not about how well your character carries out an activity. There are no modifiers, for instance, for circumstances, having the right tools at hand, or the effects of the weather. Some "moves" don't even take into account character ability, or are based on something else (e.g. "roll+Fortunes", or "roll+harm suffered").<br/><br/>* The design of many/most moves specifies the consequences of the roll (and often lets the player choose). This means that, quite often, the player making a move knows in advance its possible ramifications. If I'm making the "seduce/manipulate" move, I know that on a success my opponent WILL offer me a deal; anything else would violate the description of the move. Similarly, a successful "eye on the door" move, I know that, given a certain result, I'm "out of there" - an MC which finds an excuse to keep me in the location is very clearly and obviously breaking the rules.<br/><br/>So, in a way, while the basic chassis of the mechanic is the same, the effect in play is quite different (at least for some/most groups; certainly some D&amp;D players might apply similar logic to the d20 roll, and some AW players might use AW moves in much the same way most D&amp;D rolls work).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456952/#Comment_456952" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-07T19:09:42+00:00" title="October  7, 2016  7:09PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's an example:\n<blockquote>When you go into a holding\u2019s bustling market, looking for some particular<br/>thing to buy, and it\u2019s not obvious whether you should be able to just go buy one like<br/>that, roll+sharp.

It's not exceptional in terms of task-oriented games <i>without</i> universal skill resolution systems; earlier games that lacked the universal DC scheme of 3rd edition D&amp;D routinely had long lists of tasks (not even skills necessarily, just "here's a bunch of things that occur often in play, and how you resolve them"), and 3rd edition is simply following that tradition in its treatment, with clear procedures for how each skill is used and what the effects of successful use are. Just like 3rd ed is doing here, those games would carefully explain the circumstances where the task is appropriate, the potential modifiers, the expense of trying the task, and the consequences of success or failure. WFRPG (I happened to just recently read this a bit, which is why I return to it) for instance lists something like 30-40 different "standard tests" like this, just as if it was a AW hack with a particularly long list of universal moves.<br/><br/>When I compare the AW and D&amp;D moves, I emphatically am not talking about any other edition of D&amp;D. Just so we're clear. 2nd edition, for example, largely lacks this phenomenon as any sort of disciplined feature (to my memory, I might be wrong here), which 3rd edition brings in from other lineages such as WFRPG.<br/><br/>Hopefully, reading an example of how skills are actually outlined in 3rd edition (as opposed to relying on memory) it becomes obvious how the 3rd edition skill descriptions with their little subsystems are, in fact, "moves" in the AW sense: they define the conditions in which the skill is checked, they define the consequences of success and failure, and should a group in fact play those rules as written (a rare thing indeed, I agree 100% that this is not how the game is generally played), the line between what D&amp;D does and what AW does becomes blurry indeed. There is no obvious reason whatsoever for why using Diplomacy in play should enable the DM to undermine intent any more than AW moves allow; just like a AW move, you roll your dice and get an outcome, and that outcome determines what follow-up moves the GM is allowed to make (with the formerly hostile NPCs or monsters, in this case - do check out the definitions for the diplomacy outcomes at the end there, they're not just descriptive words).<br/><br/>In actual practice, of course, it is very common to play the 3rd edition skills with an universal skill system method, sort of like it was BRP or some similar game. So instead of the complex procedure outlined for using Diplomacy in the rules, the DM simply calls for a roll, sets a DC based on the situation and interprets the result freeform. This method, common in actual play, would be analogous to playing AW by calling for an ability check and deciding that you need a 9 to hit this enemy because they're so-and-so tough; clearly against the outlined rules procedure of the game, but easy to imagine. It just happens that while D&amp;D groups largely disregard the text, AW is played much closer to how it reads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456954/#Comment_456954" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-07T21:37:58+00:00" title="October  7, 2016  9:37PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2016 9:41PM by Paul_T.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an excellent distinction, Eero. I forget sometimes how detailed and specific the d20 skill guidelines are! There's a very strong deterministic streak in there, with each "move" having very specific outcomes. <br/><br/>I think that - as you suggest - in my own play experience, those details were usually not referenced in play.<br/><br/>However, I think there are reasons for that - it's not just a quirk of the players involved (although that's surely a factor as well!). I still feel that the rulesets offer a meaningful difference in terms of:<br/><br/>* The <i>general ethos of the game</i> design and description. Lots of little bits and pieces imply a different form of engaging with the rules (for example, the lack of modifiers based on the GM's reading of the fiction, or character skill/positioning); this comes across to the players in various ways, both explicit and implicit.<br/><br/>* The actual design of the rules. Vincent is more careful about including intent-relevant outcomes in the design of his moves, and more often explicit about those outcomes, than the phrasing of a more "task-oriented" system like d20. While the text he uses to explain moves can be pretty vague at times, there is, most often, an explicit admonition of the character's intent being achieved ("you do it", "you seize it", "yes, you can go buy it", etc). The intent being achieved is often baked right into the move itself, which is sometimes the case with D&amp;D skills and sometimes not (generally, the D&amp;D skills are oriented towards being applied in combat - for instance, the Balance skill really only determines whether you can take a Move action this turn or not - not entirely clear how to adjudicate that in the context of a man on a precarious perch trying to catch a falling vase, say).<br/><br/>To follow the earlier example, a player using the "looking for some specific thing to buy" move I copied above has a clear sense of what kind of roll will achieve that end (to buy that item). Someone making a Diplomacy skill check in d20, however, has two additional hurdles to face which can stop his action short of achieving his intent:<br/><br/>a) The rules don't fully help us (neither the player, not the GM) decide how much the target must be swayed. Is it enough for her to become Friendly? Or must we get all the way to Helpful? Or maybe even an Indifferent merchant would sell the item? I don't know. Similarly, what is the seller's initial disposition (which affects the DC of the check)?<br/><br/>The GM has plenty of room to say, "Ok, he's Friendly and Helpful now, but he already promised the item to his niece, it turns out," if that's how the GM is used to running her games.<br/><br/>b) The rules also don't help us determine whether the item is available in the first place - it is quite likely I will be able to win over the merchant only to discover that the last Item was sold earlier this morning, sorry.<br/><br/>Overall, I would still expect the average group playing D&amp;D3E to "succeed in your action but fail your intent" more often than the average AW group.<br/><br/>I should note that this feature could just as easily be seen as a design flaw; many gaming styles prefer to maintain the flexibility of more wishy-washy outcomes in the spirit of keeping player and character information at the same level, for instance. (In AW, the player knows exactly what his odds of getting that thing at the market are, whereas the character would have no way of knowing whether it was available at all.) This can be useful for other creative purposes, like exploring a consistent fictional world, or whatever other goals you may bring to a particular game.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456955/#Comment_456955" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-07T22:55:27+00:00" title="October  7, 2016 10:55PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to go read the BRP rules now to see if THEY say that players can say they try to do whatever they want.

A game which quite intentionally ruins your intent even when you succeed at a task, so as to create a feeling of helplessness?</blockquote>\nWhat I find fascinating about Paranoia is that it turns all those bugs into features by simply changing what to expect. Mechanically it's exactly the same as any other classic RPG, only here the players <i>expect</i> to be helpless and have their intentions undermined.\n<blockquote><i>Elfs</i>, for example, separates success from intent, so you can get failed tasks that accidentally bring about positive outcomes, and vice versa.</blockquote>\nElfs is the only RPG I know specifically designed around this premise and illustrates it well.\n<blockquote>In the classical analysis of this matter the difference between "action" (or "task", as many older games call it) and "intent" (or "conflict", interchangeably) is precisely in the phenomenon wherein success in an action may not bring about the consequences a character desires.</blockquote>\nI find the 'theoretical' distinction between 'task' and 'conflict' resolution to be arbitrary, nonsensical, and distracting. Ultimately it's all about resolving what happens next in the fiction, so these divisions should be made <i>between the meaningful elements of your game</i>. So if you want a game about 'combat', then you have to make sure killing something is a 'conflict', and not something you can simply 'declare'.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%23OneDoesNotSimplyWalkIntoMordor&amp;Mode=like">#OneDoesNotSimplyWalkIntoMordor</a>\n<blockquote>In D&amp;D3, you say "I attack the orc" and the system tells you if your attack is effective across the next six seconds of fighting.  You might not achieve your "intent" of defeating all the orcs - they might kill you.  But that's not a badly designed outcome.</blockquote>\nFor example, killing the ork is a 'conflict' because it's impossible to simply declare and must be achieve through a specific series of 'tasks'.\n<blockquote>Someone was recently telling me about how they play Apocalypse World with all moves being "successful"; on a 6 or less, the MC simply makes a hard move <i>as well</i>.</blockquote>\nThis is essentially how 7th Sea 2e works. The difference is the GM presents the Hard Move (Consequence) before you roll, after which you have a chance to mitigate it.\n<blockquote>I've played in more than one game (D&amp;D, or superhero games in the 90's if memory serves) where I've seen the GM grant "greater success" on a critical roll that's invalidated the original intent.<br/><br/>For example, wanting to knock someone over to prevent them from acting, but rolling "so well" that you push them off a cliff, or they hit their head on a rock and die.</blockquote>\nBut there's a difference between <i>not achieving your intent</i>, and <i>achieving something you didn't intend</i>. The two are entirely independent, and games like 7th Sea 2e only consider the latter. Taken simultaneously they do lead to some dramatic results however, like how Spiderman killed Gwen Stacy when he tried to save her.\n<blockquote>As a GM I've also seen the thing where the player describes some convoluted procedure at great length without explaining what they hope to achieve. I usually cut through it and ask what they're actually trying to do. I wonder if this sort of Cover Your Ass concealed information style comes from more adversarial GM/player "gotcha"-style play, where you want to make sure you have your bases covered but don't trust the GM not to engineer an end-run around your prep.</blockquote>\nPossibly, but they might also be trying to clarify their intent <i>indirectly</i> through more information. Otherwise it doesn't make any sense, as it doesn't prevent the GM from engineering an end-run around that prep.\n<blockquote>isn't this a fail forward mechanic or am I missing something?<br/><br/><i>You manage to lock pick  the door but guards arrives.</i></blockquote>\nThat depends. Are you picking the lock to avoid the guards?\n<blockquote>I think there are definitely moves in AW and pbta elsewhere that can undermine intent</blockquote>\nA Move <i>clearly establishes what can and cannot happen as a result of triggering it</i>, but I'd hardly equate that to undermining intent. And you don't even know which Move (if any) was triggered <i>until</i> you establish intent.\n<blockquote>It's also interesting how rules can allow or forbid certain intentions.</blockquote>\nYes it is, and I wish more designers took this into consideration when designing their RPGs as it has a profound effect on play and tends to be blindly implemented.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456983/#Comment_456983" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-09T20:22:54+00:00" title="October  9, 2016  8:22PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 9, 2016 8:25PM by David_Berg.">edited October 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This is essentially how 7th Sea 2e works.

It might have to do with the fact that there is nothing about picking the lock that directly helps you avoid the guards - you are picking the lock so you can open the door in the hopes that opening the door will help you avoid the guards.  I think there's too much chaining going on there.   If your action doesn't directly help you achieve your intent, I think there needs to be some decoupling, because otherwise you get into absurd situations like "I pick the lock to seduce the prince." because picking the lock gets you into bedchambers for a little alone time, and I don't think anyone here is going to argue that picking the lock should guarantee a successful seduction.

I doubt that anybody would have issues with intent-undermining game features if it wasn't such a widespread experience to have a GM use it for illicit control of the game narrative. The issue is not frustration as Jason suggests, but the perceived legitimacy of what the GM is doing.<br/><br/>Game texts make this dysfunction easy by encouraging players to perceive the game in terms of exciting task resolution moments, while instructing GMs to develop setpiece encounters that operate at a higher level of control in comparison to simple pass/fail task resolution. Players are led to believe that the task resolution process matters a lot, that it's basically the central thing that matters, just as David described earlier. Consequently it is relatively common to get a potential disappointment and a perception of broken trust when the player realizes how little the task resolution may actually matter to the general flow of the game: you spent all that time filling up that character sheet, managing your skills, picking and rolling, and all the while the GM actually controlled the events of the game with factors outside your control - what use to be successful in intimidating a witness when they never actually knew anything...<br/><br/>There are lots of gaming situations where this isn't an issue, but as we've seen from the excitement people have had for clearer and more even-handed game texts and GMing methodologies, it is also evident that problems in this area are a common, shared experience among many roleplayers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457047/#Comment_457047" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-12T06:29:14+00:00" title="October 12, 2016  6:29AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that it's a perception, but is the perception well-founded? <br/><br/>If I can't (for example) find anywhere in D&amp;D3 where the game promises me that (for example) my Diplomacy skill will not just shift an NPC's disposition to Helpful but ensure that the NPC will indeed be effective in helping me overcome my present challenge...<br/><br/>... then isn't the problem not with the "illicit" GM action of saying "this street beggar likes you a lot now but he can't do jack for you on this particular point of wizard college politics" <br/><br/>...nor the designer's text that says "all Diplomacy does is make NPCs more helpful", <br/><br/>...isn't the fault really in the heart of the player?  <br/><br/>I mean, yes, if someone is deranged in this manner, it isn't <i>kind</i> for me to tell them to suck it up and get with the program, and it won't help, we will have to treat them in some other way.

The game group is ultimately a democratic polity, for it cannot function without creative harmony, and that means that players may as well be getting their cues from the phases of the moon or the flight of the birds, yet nevertheless, even being all baseless, their expectations will have to be taken into account if we are to play together without strife.<br/><br/>(I have to say for the record, though, that in my experience it is not the case that players formulate these kinds of expectations without basis and due to being deranged; the reason is in misleading game texts and GMs, rather. I have never witnessed a GM instructing players clearly about how their task dicing doesn't matter as much as they think, and they shouldn't therefore get too invested in it; to the contrary, it is ordinary in my experience for the GM, no matter the truth for the game in question, to encourage this fixation and let the players invest themselves into the details of who-rolls-what.)<br/><br/>On this basis the question is not whether players are justified in holding onto this or that sort of preconception about the game they're playing; the question is whether we are capable of coming to the same page together in this matter, such that the GM doesn't end up undermining the faith and commitment of the other players in the process of the game. For this purpose I think that both solutions are equally good: either the GM needs to stop undermining (perhaps with the aid of a rules system of some sort), or the group needs to clarify the rules together, such that the players know how intent and task success interrelate in this way we are playing. Either way, it's notable how singularly unhelpful a game text can be when it comes to creative harmony; the game text does not ensure that everybody reads it, nor that everybody applies it the same. The game text may instruct either way on this matter, yet achieve nothing if the group fails in applying the text consistently together.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457049/#Comment_457049" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-12T07:03:41+00:00" title="October 12, 2016  7:03AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.

The GM's job in such a situation is to honestly tell you it's not panning out."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457060/#Comment_457060" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-12T15:56:26+00:00" title="October 12, 2016  3:56PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do we have any reason to believe the second case is a thing?

Unfortunately, many/most (no one knows the exact proportion, of course) groups and GMs very clearly do NOT do this.<br/><br/>If your argument is that it's easy to do, it will be difficult for anyone to say you're incorrect. However, gamers (in my experience), for whatever reason, do quite regularly get this wrong.<br/><br/>What can we do? Good demonstrations and good teaching help (it sounds like that's what you do). Good texts help. Good design helps as well (I pointed out some examples of how "move design" in *World games sometimes makes it explicit - in the presence of a thing like that, I think it would be much harder for the group to fall prey to one of these problems).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_457075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457075/#Comment_457075" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-12T18:50:33+00:00" title="October 12, 2016  6:50PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My personal experience doesn't really explain why anybody would think that the written game text would be paramount in resolving issues of expectation, anyway - at least hereabouts it's something like 15% of gamers who actually read rulebooks in any kind of methodical manner. Through the last 10 years it's been a given in my experience that the GM masters the rules system, whatever it is, and then transmits it orally to the other players. The games where a group would deviate from this patterns are few and far between. (The most important example being that more recent D&amp;D has had some traction for the idea that a player could read the rulebook privately, perhaps even getting a personal copy, just so they could engage the character building sub-game more thoroughly.) This goes equally for trad and progressive games.<br/><br/>And yeah, System Matters even if game texts do not somehow translate into phrase-precise practice at the game table. Whatever the players actually end up doing in play is the "System" that matters, whether its basis is in a rulebook or the GM's personal preferences or the phases of the moon. In this particular matter the System Matters pretty clearly, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

and paranoid.<br/><br/>2) Player gives up on pursuing intents, but not happily, maybe not even consciously.<br/><br/>3) Player takes actions for momentary fun rather than with intent, because attempting to connect action to intent has shown no payoff in the past.<br/><br/>4) When stymied for any reason, player is reminded of the thing that made them bitter and paranoid in the first place, and blames the situation on that.<br/><br/>"I thought I knew how to proceed but then that didn't work" messes gamers up all the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

think we're all agreeing here, in this thread, on what happens, and what could go wrong, and some ways to fix it.  We simply differ on how obvious/rational/automatic it is for the player to expect certain things at certain times.<br/><br/>I'm fine with "you interrogate an NPC and roll well and find out the truth, which is that he knows nothing" as a way to use dice.  Whether it's a fine moment of play or a frustrating waste of time really depends on other things beyond the "interrogate" dice rules.  <br/><br/>I think it's reasonable for a product calling itself a "game" to provide those other things, or enable a GM to do so with minimal difficulty, and I think it's reasonable for a player to expect that.  <br/><br/>I suppose if one steeps oneself in the history of RPG culture, then those expectations may change, but I dunno, I don't really wanna use "accept whatever failed in the past as a cost of doing business" as my baseline.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_457089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457089/#Comment_457089" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-14T01:50:17+00:00" title="October 14, 2016  1:50AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Yeah; I think the "pick the lock to avoid the guards" example is bad, and I'm trying to put my finger on why.  It might have to do with the fact that there is nothing about picking the lock that directly helps you avoid the guards - you are picking the lock so you can open the door in the hopes that opening the door will help you avoid the guards.  I think there's too much chaining going on there.<br/><br/>If your action doesn't directly help you achieve your intent, I think there needs to be some decoupling, because otherwise you get into absurd situations like "I pick the lock to seduce the prince." because picking the lock gets you into bedchambers for a little alone time, and I don't think anyone here is going to argue that picking the lock should guarantee a successful seduction.</blockquote>\nThe important difference is that in the first case you're taking action to <i>avoid</i> something that <i>will</i> happen otherwise, while in the second you're taking action to <i>cause</i> something that <i>won't</i> happen otherwise. So you'll be noticed by the guards if you <i>don't</i> act, but the prince will only be seduced if you <i>do</i> act.\n<blockquote><b>Either you need to get a little more granular, or you need to change what your challenge/scene is about</b>, because fundamentally, it should be able the thing that directly works to achieve your goal, and not the fiddly obstacles beforehand.</blockquote>\nBingo! That's why the specific actions/intents a game focuses on are so important.<br/><br/>If the intent is to avoid the guards, then doing so should <i>also</i> imply picking the lock, or hiding in the corner, or pulling a Jedi mind trick, <i>whatever method makes sense based on a character's abilities</i>. Most RPGs do the opposite and rely on the method to convey intent, which it often does poorly. Yet the difference between the two is actually arbitrary, and should be based on the situations you want your game to focus on in play.<br/><br/>But how many RPG designers actually take that into consideration?\n<blockquote>Huh.  So whenever something in the fiction is at all possible, no matter how difficult, it's basically an auto-success?  Or do we just never describe how difficult something looks, and just draw a line between "impossible" and everything else?</blockquote>\nYes.\n<blockquote>Do we try to punish really difficult feats with worse consequences?  Or do the consequences just flow from the fictional situation, regardless of how much of a stretch the success was?</blockquote>\nFor many GMs the concept of 'difficulty' is so ingrained that they end up 'punishing' really difficult feats with worse consequences just out of habit, but it's all supposed to flow naturally from the fiction.\n<blockquote>If 7th Sea 2E is more of an action movie cinema deal than a reality simulation deal, I can see how this could be fun.  We'd just need a constant source of consequences that were truly significant but didn't stop my ability to keep playing my character.</blockquote>\nThat's the idea, and it's <i>sooo</i> close.<br/><br/>Why don't you check out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/7thSea/" rel="nofollow">the 7th Sea Reddit</a> for more <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%23HintHint&amp;Mode=like">#HintHint</a>\n<blockquote>I'm curious about the 7th Sea question, too. While "success with consequences" is a well-beloved game feature around here (I've designed whole games around it!), how does the game preserve some uncertainty around outcomes? Is it even possible to have a tense scene/encounter/challenge which has us on the edge of our seats, wondering how it will turn out?</blockquote>\nIn theory, the only uncertain outcomes are if you avoid the consequences (yes but) or take the additional opportunities (yes and) offered. Even failure (no but) is something you <i>choose</i> to do.<br/><br/>In practice, the combat systems throw a huge monkey wrench into the works, and 7S2E <i>really</i> doesn't have a good handle on opposed actions.\n<blockquote>perhaps System Doesn't Matter that much after all, then.</blockquote>\nPerhaps you should run a game without a system just to verify, then :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457108/#Comment_457108" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-14T20:08:57+00:00" title="October 14, 2016  8:08PM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.  I'm cool with leaving it up to players' taste and common sense to determine what is and isn't possible for the characters.  On the other hand, knowing at the table that success is certain during a time when the characters would traditionally be in suspense ("Can I/they pull off this longshot feat or not?!") sounds dissonant to me.  I can imagine suspense over consequences filling that gap, I guess, depending on the consequences...<br/><br/>Does the game generate consequence options?

And yes, I have brought up the fact you can't suffer the Consequences <i>of your actions</i> unless you successfully took them in the first place. Falling through the roof of a building as a Consequence of leaping on it only makes sense if you successfully leap on it.<br/><br/>Which brings us full circle as that conundrum is exactly what prompted this discussion. For you see, while the above makes no sense, it is possible to successfully take action (the default in 7S2E), and suffer the Consequences, <i>but fail to achieve your intent</i>. And the reason the system keeps short circuiting for me is that action and intent is considered one and the same.<br/><br/>Well that, and the ambiguous value of a Raise (their name for 'success'), but I digress.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_457283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/457283/#Comment_457283" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-10-20T03:46:35+00:00" title="October 20, 2016  3:46AM">October 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting!<br/><br/>Sounds messy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20809/succeed-in-your-action-but-fail-your-intent" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20809/succeed-in-your-action-but-fail-your-intent" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20809/succeed-in-your-action-but-fail-your-intent/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F20809%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F20809%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
