In some games this is true; specifically in mechanically focused indie-games like <i>Mouse Guard</i>. Even classical games of old, like MERP and D&amp;D and the likes, seems to have a strong focus on mechanics. But still; most games don't play out in the mechanics/rules-sphere; that is not where <i>the fiction</i>, the real product of the game, is created ...<br/><br/>The fiction is created in the dialogue; and there's <i>a method</i> to the dialogue. Even in games where little is said about how you organize dialogue, there is a method to it. We have some of it internalized; dialogue is something we know. And we tend to tweak it a bit when playing, influenced by the advice given in the games we play.<br/><br/>There is a method to our dialogue in role-playing games, and this method is always on top of the hierarchy of tools we use to make the game work. Even the way we incorporate rules/mechanics in our game-dialogue is steered by the method. There is no game without method.<br/><br/>Seeing this is something that may inspire your praxis of game design, and may inspire you to lead classical games in new and more effective ways.<br/><br/>Have a nice day!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394585/#Comment_394585" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-24T04:01:01+00:00" title="October 24, 2012  4:01AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas did you ever give any complete details of this method?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394594/#Comment_394594" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-24T06:30:03+00:00" title="October 24, 2012  6:30AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Map making.

Me or a third one respond to that. And it goes on like that.<br/><br/>A dialogue is a pretty simple thing at first glance but when you come to think of it, it got different kind of structures depending on what you want to achieve with the dialogue. There are only three things, according to me, that different dialogues got in common.<br/><br/>1. They all got a goal. Even if it's just to break the silence between people by talking about the weather, it's still a goal.<br/>2. All dialogues are like check lists. You have to do them in order. For example: you can't ask someone how they are, before you have greeted that person.<br/>3. In order to keep a dialogue alive, it have to mutate. Either by changing the goal or the topic. Think of this next time that you're in a dialogue. Think about the dynamic flow that the dialogue have - how the topic changes - or what the cause was if the dialogue dies out.<br/><br/>Now, put these three things into a roleplaying session.<br/>- What kind of goal does the GM have? The players? The characters?<br/>- What kind of check lists does the GM have to use? The players? The system?<br/>- How will the session mutate? The GM can adapt and change it's goal after what the players do. The players can change their goals by taking in new information from the scenario. The GM can change the topic by using <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17300/and-but-because#Item_13" rel="nofollow">and, but and because</a> or any other narrative technique.<br/><br/>Your gaming experience is basically a conversation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394600/#Comment_394600" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-24T08:38:08+00:00" title="October 24, 2012  8:38AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2012 8:43AM by J_Walton.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yup.<br/><br/>EDIT: To be somewhat more helpful...<br/><br/>"You probably know this already: <b>roleplaying is a conversation.</b> You and the other players go back and forth, talking about these fictional characters in their fictional situation...

There's a lot of these role-playing games in my sphere; in the Norwegian Style of my home-country, in the Swedish Jeep-form, and in the Danish Fastaval-tradition.<br/><br/>If I include the multitude of different larps which are organized and played in all the Scandinavian countries (Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark), the list of games without the traditional mechanical focus is too long for me to even contemplate reading them all, let alone <i>playing</i> them.<br/><br/>But let me leave the many modern games of Scandinavia behind; they make it quite clear that what we call a "role-playing game" may be placed in an enormously wide spectrum of methodical approaches. That will suffice.<br/><br/>My game <i>Fabula</i> is a classical* fantasy role-playing game. It was published in 1999, and is currently in its 8th edition. It has a well developed conflict-mechanic based on rolling a single D20. It is also established with a very broad spectrum of dialogue and leader-tools, that make the game play out like no other classical game I know of. Most of the tools are well known for literate gamers, but they are seldom put into use through a well organized method. Fabula does that; it makes the leader and the players work together in various ways, by setting up varying rules for the dialogue; distributing rights and restrictions, and varying them during play.<br/><br/>Here are some of the simple hands-on methodic tools:<br/>- <b>handshake</b>; the leader make a handshake with her players; to establish direct contact and trust, and start working the magic circle<br/>- <b>calm voice</b>; the leader opens the game in a calm voice, taking her time; building serious intent, trust, focus; establishing the magic circle<br/>- <b>harsh voice</b>; the leader opens the game brutally; building no-mess mood, nervousness; establishing the magic circle<br/>- <b>soft voice</b>; the leader opens the game softly; inviting players into a psychodrama, building full trust and ownership; establishing the magic circle<br/>- <b>framing</b>; the leader has a wide array of techniques for framing scenes; to up/down tempo, point of view narration, status-differences ...<br/>- <b>players initiatives</b>; the players are invited to frame scenes; to facilitate relationship-building, share narrative responsibility, self-baiting<br/>- <b>cutting</b>; the leader has a wide array of techniques for ending scenes; to up/down tempo, opening/closing themes, twisting<br/>- etc.<br/><br/>There's a lot more to it, of course, but it may give you some clue to what I'm talking of. A lot of these tools comes with their own limitations and possibilities. They influence the game-play in various ways, both subtle and obvious. When they are applied consciously and methodically, by putting together set of tools that support the scenario at hand, they gives you and your group the ability to play the game in a lot of different ways, depending on theme and plot and other premises given by the intended fiction. <br/><br/>Some set of tools work with the mechanics, making room for die-rolling and interpretation in the dialogue. And some set of tools work very well as is, without resolving anything by the die; the dialogue rolls on and on, conflicts being resolved in-character, or not resolved at all ... <br/><br/>The mechanics is a servant to the methodical tools, not the other way around.<br/><br/>*<br/>Classical rpgs = played by a leader and players<br/>Modern rpgs = played by players only                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394899/#Comment_394899" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-26T06:02:34+00:00" title="October 26, 2012  6:02AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would be pretty interesting to hear it in action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_395018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395018/#Comment_395018" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-27T01:05:16+00:00" title="October 27, 2012  1:05AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks!

First of all, and I generalize like hell now, roleplaying gamers aren't that social to begin with. They don't think of social structures and communication.<br/><br/>2. Conventions (how you play the game - communication is one part of it) are things that you have to analyse to find out about. And it's hard to analyse things you don't think about (see point 1).<br/><br/>3. It's a tradition in roleplaying games to write rule mechanics. Rules are nothing more than procedures, just like communication is, but rules are (perhaps) easier to grasp. How you play the game (conventions) are also things, by tradition, that the game designer leave to the reader to find out by it's own. Probably because the game designer didn't think about it (see point 2)?<br/><br/>There are game designer, like Robin D Laws, that disguise conventions and structured dialogue in rules. It's a really neat way to get the average roleplayers to learn how to communicate with each other, so the game can be improved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_395030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395030/#Comment_395030" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-27T03:02:34+00:00" title="October 27, 2012  3:02AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2012 3:04AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, not quite, Rickard; it is obvious to all that we use dialogue when playing. Of course! <br/><br/>What is NOT obvious, is why we do so little to organize the dialogue in methods!<br/><br/>It has nothing to do with role-players being less social than other people. I do not agree with you in this, Rickard. Roleplayers are indeed very social; and they engage in THE most social of all art-forms; the dialogue-based art of role-playing games.<br/><br/>But ...<br/>- most designers have given little attention to the actual dialogue going on in their games, and as a result; neither do players.<br/>So you are right in part 3, Rickard; designers tend to think in mechanics, and players tend to play the games they get (and to copy them when making their own). This has made us, as a culture, build a church of mechanics-worship! Nothing wrong with mechanics, but seeing only mechanics in how we play rpgs, or when designing them, is being very shortsighted indeed.<br/><br/>We have to start a reformation of rpgs, to free our spirits!<br/>We need methodical game-play, so our spirits may soar, with greater ease and joy, towards the heavens!<br/>Hallelujah!<br/><img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395034/#Comment_395034" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-27T03:38:05+00:00" title="October 27, 2012  3:38AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2012 3:42AM by Rickard.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It has nothing to do with role-players being less social than other people.

D&amp;D is the most played game of all time, and that game draws a lot of people that think in numbers and not of humans. Yes, there are social nerds in our hobby as well, but my impression from roleplaying conventions, is that roleplayers in general aren't that social. The LARP scene however, seems different.\n<blockquote>We have to start a reformation of rpgs, to free our spirits!</blockquote>\nIt's actually something that's been going on these last years, probably beginning with Apocalypse World*. Apocalypse World is trad, seen from another perspective.<br/><br/>* and similar development in the Swedish scene as well. People rediscovering Jeepform and other freeform techniques from the 90's. A small number of people though, I admit.<br/><br/>PS. When I read that Fabula was  in it's eights version, I actually got interested. Your ideas is pretty far out (in a good experimental way), but when I heard about it around 2003 I thought it was just another one of those fantasy heartbreakers. How has the game developed (changed) over the years? You can take this in a new thread, if you want, but I wonder from a dialogue-based point of view.

(sigh).<br/><br/>But you are right; it is indeed going on! And I rejoice in that fact!<br/><br/>Fabula is a classical frpg. The first edition was made in 1995. The game has been used in professional GMing since then, by me and others. Thats the reason I have done so many revisions of it; a lot of different campaigns tend to reveal any hidden weakness you may think of. Since publishing it in 1999 the game has undergone three major revisions, each of them strengthening the dialogue-part of it. The last revision (#9) is almost done these days, and will give leaders a game with hands-on advice on how to lead a group and direct dialogue in fruitful ways; with simple and effective tools. The players handbook will give similar advice, on a different level, on how to play a character, frame a scene, take directions from the leader and the other players, and on how you engage in different kinds of interaction with a positive attitude.<br/><br/>Anyone publishing a classical role-playing game today, wether new or revised, should give these aspects of the method proper treatment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395039/#Comment_395039" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-27T05:36:33+00:00" title="October 27, 2012  5:36AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2012 5:36AM by Rickard.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>AW is late to the show, in my view; but it seems to be a nice game.

Planting mantras (barf forth) and other ways to steer the way of thinking of the GM, it's really teh shit. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>The game has been used in professional GMing since then, by me and others.</blockquote>\nYeah, you're getting paid to GM, right? I was interested to learn more about roleplaying games in my neighbour Nordic countries around 2003. Fabula and your name was one of the things I came across.\n<blockquote>The players handbook will give similar advice, on a different level, on how to play a character, frame a scene, take directions from the leader and the other players, and on how you engage in different kinds of interaction with a positive attitude.</blockquote>\nWhen I published my game Matin\xe9 in 2009, I learned that people tend to ignore GM advice and focus on the rules. Half of the book consisted of game advice and some were actually important for how you should run the game. The ones who asked me questions about the game was the ones who hadn't read the GM section. But to be fair, I had a lot of advice concerning rather uninterested ideas, so the book should have been revised to give it more focus.<br/><br/>I will probably pick up Fabula in the future. Would be interesting to see what kind of thoughts the game will offer. I mostly read just the GM section in games nowadays. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_395045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395045/#Comment_395045" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-27T06:41:20+00:00" title="October 27, 2012  6:41AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice of you to say so!
