After some lounging and chatting at a cafe, we spontaneously busted out Dungeon World. We played schoolmates at something like an adventurer's college. We used all of the classes except for the wizard.<br/><br/>(Possible little spoiler for Purple Worm's Graveyard coming up!)<br/><br/>Remi played the evil halfling thief Bug, and I was the evil fighter with con 8 (so we bonded over the whole backstabbing approach). We were running theft and fencing cons at the college. Matt G. was the bard, and through the bard's bonds, he decided he was habitually mocking Bug. In fact, when Jeremy's ranger read the tracks inside the Purple Worm Graveyard dungeon and told us there were disfigured goblins shuffling around, Matt's character was like, "Just to get a good image of them, are they more or less disfigured than Bug?"<br/><br/>So when Bug found a trapped door that when closed would lock the heroes in a room and unleash monsters, he was like, "it's all clear, go ahead!"  So the ranger, cleric and paladin went right in, but Bug stopped the bard, slammed the door shut, and jammed his dagger into her gut. "THAT'S FOR ALL THOSE SONGS!" Maybe there was minor resentment over the mockery.<br/><br/>Short game told even shorter, the three heroes that were locked in lost the paladin to the unleashed monsters (they didn't have a fighter to help them out), and I, sworn to protect Bug, had to run down the hightailing bard with my sinister mace because I couldn't leave any witnesses against Bug alive. Then Bug trapped the entrance to the dungeon and we went home, whistling joyfully.<br/><br/>THE END!<br/><br/>PS: Dungeon World is a lot of fun, even when you're not getting to slay the party bard! The bonds are awesome relationship starters.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333691/#Comment_333691" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-09T11:34:03+00:00" title="July  9, 2011 11:34AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2011 11:35AM by Ben_Robbins.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just put up the <b><a href="http://www.goplaynw.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=17" rel="nofollow">GPNW Afterglow: What We Played</a></b> forum.<br/><br/>If you post here (or anywhere else) make an entry there and link it, so the other players from your game can find it.

Maj. Bustem and Captain Taffy worked to thwart Urban Shaman and his father, Mousetrap, in their "bare essentials" plan to telepathically control the Boy Scouts to build and install devices in their parents cars that would result in a massive pileup of collisions in the retail district just loud and precise enough to shatter all the windows of the jewelry stores so their henchmen could walk in and liberate the jewels.  Didn't actually thwart much, but Captain Taffy managed to prevent theft of the Crown Jewel by ... posing as the Crown Jewel.  <em>Outcome: Steven learns humility ... is for people who are not geniuses.</em><br/><br/>Lady Blackbird: Played Kale, the ship's resident <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">engineer</span> kleptomaniac.  Helped Lady B with a situation involving some lost keys and an important trunk.  Had a discussion with Lady B's bodyguard about property rights.  <em>Outcome: I learn the merits of cuttlefish as a munition.</em><br/><br/>Dungeon World: I played one game not run by Sage, one game run by Sage, and one game run by me.  Loved all three.  Played two utterly different clerics, one a salt-of-the-earth servant of the god of hard labor, the other a kindly, helpful, bookish, and deeply evil servant of Nyarlat'hotep (in retrospect this should have been Thoth, probably).  In the game I ran, the characters set out to recover a jewel one of the two thieves had lost, and wound up disrupting some kind of archeological mining operation adjacent to a massive underground dungeon.  Bjorn the cleric died standing in the doorway of the dungeon.  The rest of the characters proceeded into the depths.  <em>Outcome: Even after the events of the opening battle, the other players are mystifyingly still convinced that Chris Bennet's character is on their side.</em> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_333900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333900/#Comment_333900" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-11T13:58:04+00:00" title="July 11, 2011  1:58PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite>Coldsnap!

During the Tilt, both tables exchanged pieces of content and incorporated it into the second half of their games. In my JFK assassination research, I had not been aware until now that a pair of second-rate thieves had tried to rip off a reel-to-reel tape of the Beatles new record 'A Hard Day's Night' from the trainyard just beyond the Grassy Knoll.  My character certainly deserved a better end than being handcuffed to Lee Harvey Oswald and being accidentally shot by Jack Ruby on live TV.<br/><br/>Playing Dungeon World twice in two days. First time was GM'd by Tony Dowler using one of his cool microdungeons, and Sage (one of the designers) was at the table. Second time was by a relatively new GM to the ruleset. And as I had a crappy time running AW last year, this gave me a good vantage point on where the game design is now. Apocalypse World just didn't do it for me, and running OD&amp;D for two years had led to plenty of hacks to smooth off the rough edges. I feel like Sage and co. had basically codified how I really wanted to run old-school dungeon crawls into a ruleset. Props!<br/><br/>Finally playing Danger Patrol, which I had first seen at GPNW 2009. But this was Brendan's "I tried to fake John Harper into giving me the Gamma rules that actually don't exist so I had to hack them together in a day" ruleset. And I think we can safely say that his ersatz rules fucking ROCKED. I got to play Quan Li, Mystic Explorer. I felt like the game really riffed on the love that was Lady Blackbird, and extended it with smoother rules for skills and tags. I didn't see any evidence of XP and Keys (which aren't really necessary for a one-shot) so I'd love to see how the game would play out over several sessions. And I loved how Brendan took a throwaway scene of mine and turned it into the basis for the final battle with the Queen and her sticky-gross spider minions.<br/><br/>The Regiment still needs some work, but I enjoyed the "WW2 never quite ended, it just dragged on for 40 years" premise and what John and Paul (and I'm sure George and Ringo) are doing to extend the AW ruleset. Some real promise here and I'd like to dig in more.<br/><br/>The Believers (play-in-15-mins roleplaying poem) was quite weird. Part of the way through the arrival of the aliens, people were shooting at them and battles were going on. But when things calmed down, either the world was convinced that the aliens meant well, or (more likely) they were brainwashed. Three of the four players chose to go with the aliens.<br/><br/>Susan played a great medium in Seance (another roleplaying poem of mine). I love how this game of friends and relatives communing with the dead always turns into internal quabbles. Much fun was had.<br/><br/>It Wasn't Me! was our "GM-less murder mystery in about an hour". Turns out Lady Gaga was killed by a kid's all-day sucker in the throat after a bizarre trebuchet accident that was setup by her manager. Simply horrible.<br/><br/>And how could I forget our now-yearly Roach game with an amazing group of players? Johnzo wrote a truly disturbing hack and took place at a Writers Convention full of aspiring authors desperate for a book deal. I will just say "Spongebob Squarepants G-string" and move on here...<br/><br/><br/>Amazing time.

I signed up for this mostly because <i>omg it's that guy from the Internet</i>, and because I had heard the name of the game a million times due to it being mentioned around here. This was probably a mistake, in retrospect -- I did not have much fun playing this game. Or rather, I had fun playing the game, but very little play occured due to the large number of players -- something I contributed to by insisting on creating my own PC rather than share with Phil -- and the general demo-game approach Andy took towards the material. Also a whole lot of talking about things rather than demonstrating them.<br/><br/>I did enjoy creating my 11-year old armour-pilot, a devoted sister of a powerful noble family who lived in her elder brother's shadow until he was killed (in the first scene, at my request) while under her protection. The entertaining random social mechanics meant that I fell in love-at-first-sight with a cocky, cynical mercenary armour-hunter, which given the characters' relative ages was more or less destined to be a terrible idea. And in general, I think we had a fairly cool collection of PCs, but getting through only one scene each made it difficult to take that anywhere interesting. The boss fight at the end was as bored as I got all weekend.<br/><br/>Feedback to Andy, since I imagine he will be demoing this game a lot once it comes out: show, don't tell! Don't let 7 people into the game if you only want 4 PCs! More story scenes would have been better than a boring boss fight, though probably would not have fit in the time we had either. More positively, great job getting everyone using the fan mail, and the Zero Scenes were all lots of fun.<br/><br/>Most of the Con, <b>Grudge Mansion</b>. This was Brendan's 'assassin-like' meta-con-game, my experience of which is detailed <a href="http://www.goplaynw.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=277" rel="nofollow">in this GoPlayNW Forum thread</a>. Suffice to say that in the end I was murdered, but at least I made my murderer drop his banana chasing me down.<br/><br/>Saturday morning, <b>Silver &amp; Light</b>. I doubt Jackson could make a game I wouldn't enjoy playing, especially with him, Jonathan Walton &amp; Tori Brewster at the table with me, but this game feels practically custom-made. Bored suburban teenagers? A nearly-existential mystery? Yearning for an impossible, beautiful escape? <i>Narration-sharing mechanics that shift around the table whenever your characters touch?</i> Hell, yes. (But it's still no <i>Love Nothing</i>, damnit.) There's definitely ways this could get even better, though, and I'm looking forward to playing future versions.<br/><br/>We also decided to move a table outside to play this game -- I don't know what was going on with the AC, but it was extra-stuffy inside that morning. As we set up, I mentioned to my fellow-players that by that afternoon half the con would be out there with us -- which turned out to be unsurprisingly-prophetic.<br/><br/>Saturday early-afternoon, <b>The Quiet Year</b>. I think there were three or four different groups running Joe McDaldno's British post-apocalypse game; we had to play in the main room to avoid Tony Dowler's murderous intentions towards yours-truly, which meant that we were mostly left to our own devices with the playtest rules &amp; a deck of cards. Handling time was high as we got started, with some rules hard to find, but once we got going it was a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Our Quiet Year was for a group of survivors who had moved into an abandoned high school in a mostly-overgrown gated community. We had fresh water in abundance, but lacked skilled labour, security, and mobility. My faction immediately began to catalogue the remains of the school's library in the hopes of starting up a rigorous training program, while other community members built a fence to protect us from the predatory animals that roamed the nearby forest. A lucky find of gas-station-remains in the forest solved our immobility problem before it got out of hand, fueling our dilapidated fleet of two school buses, but the other scarcity-driven threats proved much more difficult to address.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Kynin's faction displayed a somewhat questionable understanding of priorities, devoting significant resources to digging up the mass grave we found under the school fields in order to process the bodies into bonemeal to fertilize their farming expansion -- which earned several tokens worth of Contempt from what remained of the library faction. Scouts located a nearby sporting goods store, which was promptly raided for just enough guns and ammo to cause trouble. <br/><br/>A fellow-player: "Okay, so I see the opportunity here, but what's the risk?" <br/>Me: "What's the risk? <i>They're guns</i>, that's the risk."<br/><br/>In the end it was only the noble sacrifice of two of my faction's three leaders that secured the community when the forest wolves, pushed to near starvation by the lack of prey and our well-built fence, stormed the school. Only Bartholomew (?), the architect of the library-restoration, survived to carry forward our mission. <br/><br/>Longer-term, the lack of skilled labour -- specifically, medical expertise -- continued to undermine the community's best efforts at reconstruction. There was a breakthrough, however, due to the arrival of a straggling group of refugees at our gates -- which prompted the one and only Discussion among our community leaders. Despite some major difficulties integrating the refugees into our society, we eventually managed to built an infirmary for the doctor, but not before at least one community leader lost their life after a wound from a farming accident was left untreated.<br/><br/>Another faction lost several leaders as the result of a cult that sprung up in the now-safe forest, related to some mysterious lights that appeared only at night. The cult, largely left unaddressed, became increasingly meddlesome, sabotaging several projects and plotting to steal the school buses. Unfortunately, our game was cut short by time just before the advent of Fall, which would have surely brought even more troubles and opportunities to our doorstep. Which was a shame, since I had only just begun efforts to recruit the (apparently quite sexy) doctor to my faction to replace their decimated leadership.<br/><br/>Saturday later-afternoon, <b>Ribbon Drive</b>. I must facilitate this game every con, and so it was again, with myself, Joe, Morgan, Jamie &amp; Wilson setting up outdoors with the assistance of a very long extension cord -- this required a death-defying dash through The Room Where I Could Be Killed in order to plug it in, but thankfully Mr. Dowler was nowhere to be seen. I distributed extra mixes for those who had not had a chance to prepare, and in the end it was <a href="http://youtu.be/Lh7JZUpaVPg" rel="nofollow">Shore Leave</a> that was chosen.<br/><br/>Our road trip turned out to be four Navy men on the way to a wedding -- the groom being one of them, and his gay lover being another -- joined by a childhood friend of the groom who had come to pick them up and who had also been meanwhile sleeping with the bride. As always, the game delivered, though much credit also to my fellow-players -- Morgan's character, Billy, was the highlight for me. Never before has a trait about doing push-ups been put to such effective use, and his cog-with-no-machine putdown of my outsider, Francis, had the harsh ring of truth about it. Jamie's uniform-wielding stonewalling of the bouncer at some middle-of-nowhere strip club -- "I'm going to have to ask you to apologize" -- was great.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the shorter time slot proved to be a bit of a hindrance -- this game definitely would have shone a little bit brighter with more room to breathe, and we had to rush towards the wedding at a somewhat breakneck speed. The final showdown/shouting match at the family restaurant, with Jamie's poor seaman trapped between two separate arguments, was a nice wrap-up, though in the end no clear protagonist emerged, and we rounded the session off with a wedding-day montage.<br/><br/>Saturday evening (off-site), <b>Bacchanal</b>. After some daytime plotting, a group of us withdrew to Tori's house to drink wine and play Bacchanal, Paul Czege's game of debauchery &amp; sexually-explicit narration. It was interesting, and made me somewhat less uncomfortable than I had expected -- though still a little <i>uncomfortable</i>, ifyouknowwhatImean.<br/><br/>Sunday morning, <b>Sleep In So I Can Drive Home To Vancouver Tonight Without Killing My Passengers</b>. By far the smoothest game of the weekend for me, thanks to my extra-drowsy anti-histamine/cat pills.<br/><br/>Sunday afternoon, <b>Don't Rest Your Head</b>. I was feeling pretty cliquey by the time I arrived at Sunday afternoon without having participated in a single Game Donut, so I hied me hence and, due to a lack of other facilitators, ended up stepping forward to run DRYH for a group of enthusiastic players. <br/><br/>This session was simultaneously a lot of fun and, in retrospect, the source of some regret. I love to GM the game, but my approach to doing so in a con environment might leave something to be desired -- we had probably-one-too-many PCs and between that and my failing to encourage character-crossover, the result was several very fun (for me at least) but also very disconnected scenes. In the end only half the players got to move their story very far past those first few moments of 'WTF is going on?' and into the part of the game where they start getting to be a little more proactive about their troubles. That said, I got to make use of my collection of printed-out character portraits, and even used up one of my random-DRYH-cue index cards: <i>A card game played in the back of a city bus.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334428/#Comment_334428" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T04:28:57+00:00" title="July 14, 2011  4:28AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Feh, 1266 characters too long -- whatever!<br/><br/>Sunday evening, <b>Fiasco</b>. I have come to the conclusion that I am a very bad player of Fiasco. No matter what I do I can't seem to bring myself to make my character enough of a fuck-up; they end up all well-adjusted, or at best ill-adjusted but in a totally sympathetic, reasonable way. Overall I would say that this was a very bad session of Fiasco, but a thoroughly-enjoyable, entertaining session of some-other-game. We used the Southern Town playset, and rolled a shit-ton of 4s, resulting in every single inter-PC relationship being Romantic in nature.<br/><br/>I had great love -- indeed, far too much love, as mentioned -- for all our characters. I played Kansas, the younger half of a 20-and-60-year-old lesbian couple who had recently eloped, but had not yet told the town that they were actually in a relationship, yet alone married -- a fact which did not sit well with Kansas at all, and for which she plotted revenge upon the morally-uppity wife of the mayor, Mrs. Harper. Jackson played my childhood friend, Darla, who had been harbouring a secret crush on Kansas since the two of them were children -- which led to some great scenes of simmering sexual tension, including skinny dipping together in the old quarry pools.<br/><br/>Darla was also the ex-lover of Billy Ray, a 20-something insurance broker who lived next door to the Quic-Pic by the interstate, where she worked (she also owned it, having bought it from her ex-boss in what turned out to be a somewhat sketchy deal.) Lee played Billy Ray with a lovely combination of aw-shucks southern charm and seemingly-guileless guile -- his attempts to get back in Darla's pants, which mostly consisted of constantly walking over to the Quic-Pic to buy a single coke and making moon-eyes in her direction, did not however meet with much success.<br/><br/>For some reason I am blanking on the name of the last character, and her player (Melissa?) -- which is terrible, because both the character &amp; the player were certainly the most brilliant thing about the whole session. The unnamed PC in question, a 60-year-old librarian who was engaged in constant warfare with the Baptist minister's attempts to censor the library's collection, was the very model of southern propriety, kindliness, and smutty-mindedness. I had no trouble understanding what Kansas saw in her, and this was probably my favourite romantic relationship in an RPG in recent memory -- which, see above about my being a terrible Fiasco player. I couldn't help but want their relationship to be functional and sexy and mostly-well-adjusted! I just couldn't stop myself, no matter how ominous the enormous pile of black dice in the center of the table started to look.<br/><br/>In the end we ran out of time just as we arrived at the Tilt -- which was probably for the best, as there was really almost nothing <i>to</i> tilt at that point, due to a serious lack of fiascos in our Fiasco. We did our best to gin something up and zoom through the post-tilt scenes, but even after Kansas stole Mrs. Harper's dildo and rubbed poison ivy all over it, there just wasn't enough to go on. We threw in an insurance scam plot and managed to at least get Darla involved in a three-way+ with her lifelong crush, but in the end all our characters met ridiculously-tonally-inappropriate endings, which I prefer to ignore in favour of imagining the rest of their less-Fiasco-like, if somewhat complicated lives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334452/#Comment_334452" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T08:38:44+00:00" title="July 14, 2011  8:38AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2011 8:42AM by johnzo.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First of all, we're all indebted again to Tony, Phil, John P, John H, and Brandon for another fantastic GPNW.  Thank you so much, guys.  The facilities were great, the meal was savory, the t-shirts were handsome, and I think the game scheduling / donut were very well organized.  You guys do great credit to your hobby.<br/><br/>Other reactions:<br/><br/><b>Dungeon World</b> is crazy fun.  The Bonds are super hot stuff, wonderfully provocative, and we had subplots galore play out as we took down the necromancer of the caves.<br/><br/>If you keep your head down, you can win <b>Fiasco</b>, even with tablemates as evil as Ogre, Peter Adkinson, and Dustin.  It was great to play with you guys, it was one of those games where I started almost completely blank and then the scenes played out so provocatively that I got my head around my guy and staked out some narrative space very quickly.  One of my most enjoyable Fiasco games ever. <br/><br/>You can make a very good Star Trek episode using <b>My Life With Master</b>, if you are Ben Robbins.<br/><br/>If everyone is <b>Roached</b>, then the proper approach is to split into rider/mount pairs and joust for supremacy.  Have a podcaster on hand to document the results.<br/><br/>There's no point in me scheduling any more morning sessions.  I'm losing my power to hurry towards fun.  Still, found myself glancing enviously at Ogre's all-day <b>Burning Wheel</b> game and wondering what it would be like to have a 6-hour slot.<br/><br/>I need to try to get an <b>IAWA</b> campaign going locally.  We played 1.5 chapters in a session at GPNW and it was the first time I'd ever played a multi-chapter con game, and I really liked it.<br/><br/><b>MIcroscope</b> is a super reliable fun producer, and I keep replaying bits and pieces of our Monsters Rule Creation game in my mind.<br/><br/>Finally, I'm super pumped to hear that <b>Montsegur</b> got some table time.  It's wonderful to see enduring love for that great game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short" title="Lee_Short"><img alt="Lee_Short" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short">Lee_Short</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334542/#Comment_334542" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T18:34:25+00:00" title="July 14, 2011  6:34PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played in Wilson Zorn's playtest of his game under development, call umm...,umm..., something-or-other.  The players choose a community that is in conflict against the mainstream and each plays a different faction of that community.  We elected to play animals of the forest rebelling against human encroachment.  The four factions were the Red Squirrels, the Crows, the Wolves, and the Moose.  Wilson played Fate (the GM role &amp; opposition).  The game had a very nice set of mechanics for conflicting values of the community against each faction trying to get more influence for themselves.  We handily smacked those human encroachers and reclaimed our rightful forest!  Wilson said that in past games, it hasn't gone nearly so easy.  I'm thinking that maybe the one thing that the rules need most is a balancing mechanism (ie, if the community is getting ahead, then success gets harder).  Very fun, though.  <br/><br/>I also played Fiasco, Microscope, and Fiasco again (the last being the game that Ice Cream Emporer mentions above -- I completely agree with his assessment of it).  <br/><br/>I ran Dungeon World.  There were a couple of hiccups as I hadn't had much time to review the rules (and was unaware of the new Spout Lore).  We got those sorted out pretty quickly, and I thought the game was fun.  Hope the players did too.  The dungeon itself was Rogahn and Zelligar meet the Caves of Chaos.  The party barely fought there way into Rogahn and Zelligar's fortress when the slot was over.  I think maybe my hard moves weren't quite hard enough, and could have challenged the party a little more.  <br/><br/>I also ran Amber Shadows, my tarot game that is loosely based on Chris Lehrich's <i>Shadows in the Fog</i>.  Had an awesome group of players, and was lots of fun.  Fortunately, they are all locals and we've agreed to continue the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short" title="Lee_Short"><img alt="Lee_Short" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lee_Short">Lee_Short</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334561/#Comment_334561" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T21:09:26+00:00" title="July 14, 2011  9:09PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>For some reason I am blanking on the name of the last character, and her player (Melissa?) -- which is terrible, because both the character &amp; the player were certainly the most brilliant thing about the whole session.

And that is truly saying something! Kudos to Phil, Tony, Ben and the Johns for yet another great event. Additional applause for the Friday Night Feast - that was mighty tasty.<br/><br/>Johnzo and I had a similar "victory condition" for the con: Play <b>Dungeon World</b>. So we pulled together some like-minded people and gently twisted John Harper's arm to run it and everyone had a great time. A perfect start to the con.<br/><br/>I love <b>Monsterhearts</b>. I want to play more Monsterhearts. I want Joe to publish Monsterhearts so I can love and play it more. I've never had more fun being slammed up against a high school locker or turning into a huge werewolf (or lapdog/punching bag, depending on your perspective).<br/><br/>Dale, Lukas and I took advantage of an unexpected lull to play <b>Ghost/Echo</b> in GMless fashion. What resulted was a beautifully co-scripted and deeply engaging session. The three of us clicked and the unbelievably rich two-pager provided everything we needed. We easily could have done a follow-on session, it was that fun.<br/><br/>Our annual <b>Roach</b> game was slightly less gonzo than in years past but oh so satisfying in terms of wacky, dysfunctional interaction. I think I had even more fun playing the numerous NPCs Johnzo gave us in his Writers' Conference playset than my own character. Jackson wins best manuscript name: "Fire on Mountaintop Mountain."<br/><br/>I was waffling about running anything this year but I pushed through that to facilitate a session of <b>Lady Blackbird</b>, my first time running it. We got the crew as far as Haven in those short hours and the play around the table was really rewarding for me as a GM. The story wound up having a nice arc, resolving the central question of, "Do we remain together and see this through?" Such a nice ending to have Captain Vance extend his hand and say, "May I escort you to your ship, milady?" And then to have Lady Blackbird accept. Thanks to Morgan, Dale, Andrew, Jason and Devin for making that so much fun.<br/><br/>Much has been said about Brendan playing <b>Danger Patrol</b> chicken with Dr. Harper. I was there... it's all true. And my favorite character from GPNW, Indiglow Girl, 10-year-old Atomic Warrior, will again see play somehow, somewhere, some day. And she'll be dogged by Truant Officer Brown again. Oh, and bats. More bats.<br/><br/>To cap it all off, John Hawkins ran a final session of <b>Dungeon World</b> for us. Despite what looked to be a TPK in the making, we somehow got through it and even progressed a bit into the dungeon.

Was the kingdom saved and everybody had a happy ending as usual?</blockquote>\nActually, I think the Kingdom <i>was</i> saved.<br/><br/>The Knight discovered the Earl with the Sei\xf0kona in the lover's cave and tried to kill him.  It was not so easy.  After leaving the cave the Knight went to the King to try to persuade him that he should not marry his daughter to the Earl.  In his jealous fury, he began to wolf out.  We'd established earlier an association of the Eastern Kingdom with the Wolf and, of course, the "Western Kingdom" and our King protagonist was associated with the Bear.  The King used the last of his strength to slay the Knight with one of the many swords that lined his hall, before himself expiring.  Many among the Earl and King's retinues saw this exchange and the Earl's advisers began to whisper about this being a bad omen regarding the marriage of the two factions.<br/><br/>The Earl, (me), having seen the Sei\xf0kona as a callous game of thrones <b>USER</b> and the Princess as a difficult pawn, used this ill omen as an excuse to call off the marriage *and* the pending war and slunk back to the East.  He succumbed to his poison experiments a year or so later.<br/><br/>Without the King around, (the one she'd decided she loved), the Sei\xf0kona no longer had him as a backer and was ultimately exiled to the swamps beyond the capital.<br/><br/>The Princess and the King shared a moment before he expired.  He forgave her various rebellions and instilled a warrior's spirit in her.  I think she ruled the kingdom relatively wisely in his stead.<br/><br/>This was my sixth or seventh session of Love in the Time of Sei\xf0 and it is still very fun, varied and surprising to me.  I hadn't facilitated it for a while so I did not explain the procedures as well as I have previously, but I think everyone had a pretty good time. <br/><br/>If I get a chance to play the Earl again I will play him less despicably, a choice I think might make for a more interesting game for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth" title="Seth"><img alt="Seth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth">Seth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334985/#Comment_334985" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-17T23:20:26+00:00" title="July 17, 2011 11:20PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2011 11:21PM by Seth.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Played:</b> <a href="http://www.goplaynw.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=289" rel="nofollow">Capes</a>, <a href="http://www.goplaynw.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=290" rel="nofollow">Capes</a> and Capes<br/><br/>It was awesome!<br/><br/>(I actually recorded the third one, so it's taking me a little longer to write up...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334988/#Comment_334988" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-18T00:04:42+00:00" title="July 18, 2011 12:04AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: graypawn</cite><b>Played</b>:<i>House of Cards, Sleeping In, The Quiet Year, Anima Prime, Amber Shadows, Anima Prime:  Transformers</i><br/></blockquote>\nGaaaaah!
