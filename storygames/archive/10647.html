I decided to quickly call in to the massive library in Santa Clara, Ca (which I'm practically next door to) to volunteer my services. The librarian I spoke to hasn't heard about this program, and she said she'd discuss it with a few other people after I directed them to the website and gave my phone number and credentials. Here's hoping things go well.<br/><br/>Still, this might be a great way to introduce people to story games and show it's not all slaying monsters by the metric ton.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236210/#Comment_236210" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T14:56:16+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  2:56PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gah, I've been meaning to call my local libraries and ask about/pitch this.
