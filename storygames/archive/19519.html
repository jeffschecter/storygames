Do you want the genre emulated thoroughly through mechanics or is it okay to simply roleplay and establish a specific 'spirit of play'? How deep and crunchy do you want the fighting system to be? How about powers?

I can't say Anima prime actually gets anime, nor exalted. For me anime can't be played with rules that consider a "level of normality" and exagerate the abilities of the PCs over that level. It's more like, the things that actually matter on the world work on a single level and everything under it is hand-waved. It's kinda hard to explain, but anime fans (don't call 'em "otakus") do feel the difference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434039/#Comment_434039" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-18T16:11:12+00:00" title="June 18, 2014  4:11PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps a simple description of that quality of most anime drama is "theatrical": anime storytelling is generally focused on individuals and issues, while the background reality is glossed in a way that is basically familiar to older generations from the theater. A game that suits well for e.g. shonen fight anime style play needs to be able to do those theatrical tricks: quick scene transitions, highly figurative background reality, quickly sketched stock characters, and tight plots where everything matters. As it happens, these qualities are shared by many post-millenium narrativist drama games, so the tools are actually pretty good for this sort of thing now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434045/#Comment_434045" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-18T20:54:16+00:00" title="June 18, 2014  8:54PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, would you be at all interested in sharing the personal designs you spoke of?

Perhaps saying it doesn't get Anime is an exageration from my part and what I got was just a bad mojo from texts here and there. For example I found this one:<br/><br/><i>Third, the PCs are highly competent and most likely capable of acrobatics and other acts far beyond the abilities of most normal humans (they\u2019re anime characters, after all). This means they\u2019re likely to succeed at many difficult tasks, and having mechanics that frequently turn out failures wouldn\u2019t fit. </i><br/><br/>As an anime fan, this goes without saying for me. You can just state to me "this game is anime-like" (or even just show me it is by using anime-like art) and keep the basic game mechanics from any trad game (without using the references of height and distance of the jumps); my imagination will do the rest. Actually, as a player or a GM all the detail I need is to know if whether the character can jump or not in a particular moment and if it gets somewhere in time to do/avoid something. The level of the character or his jumping skills won't make much difference in terms of meters, but if anything, in terms of "a jump" and "an unvelievable far jump", if we're talking of some kind of special ability.<br/><br/>So, while maybe a good point for GMs or players who aren't used to playing in an anime-like fiction, the quoted statement sends me into a bit of a bad mojo, like I'm reading a book either made by someone who isn't used to anime as much as I do or had to write it in such way to address it at people who aren't into anime. Granted, later in the book there's no other reference in the mechanics to actual measures, but this kinds texts tipped me off of reading up to that point before.<br/><br/>Later on page 17 of the SRD I found this:<br/><br/><i>What kind of content would you like to see in your story? Lots of intense fights, introspection, romance, intrigue, exploration, or anime slapstick comedy? Are the combats wall-running, somersaulting action spectacles with no real blood or gruesome shot guns-and-tentacles gore fests? </i><br/><br/>Ok, I know this is only referencing common anime tropes, but then again, for anime fans anime isn't actually different from other kinds of fiction except in the SFX department, which is provided by our own imagination. A story is a story anywhere in the world, genres aren't too different to need different names. You can just say "combat" and "comedy" and we get the idea. And if we're talking of veils and limits (to keep the quote in context), "anime slapstick comedy" isn't different to "slapstick comedy".<br/><br/>So you see, it's nothing that could actually get me offended in anyway, just a bit of bad mojo. I'm still re-reading the mechanics and now I can't really find anything wrong with them. <br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>Ok, after reading the game for most of the morning, I give up. I still can't say if Anima Prime gets the "anime feeling" or not particularly better than any other game and I'm actually wondering now what is exactly this "anime feeling" we're talking about anymore. All I know is that for me any game with an inspiring atmosphere whose rules don't get in the way of making any kind of story would do. Anima Prime could work and all I can say against it is that my own interpretation of these otherwise innocent quotes predisposed me against the game, and that's it.

If the system can\u2019t handle that, it\u2019s a dealbreaker.<br/><br/>I\u2019d like to throw out another possibility which I almost never see come up:<br/><br/><strong><a href="http://www.museoffire.com/Games/about.html" rel="nofollow">Capes</a></strong>!<br/><br/>I almost never see the <em>Story Games</em> community talk about <strong>Capes</strong>, which is a terrible shame since it was one of the more interesting, GM-less, narrative designs that actually started compelling my fascination with GM-less methodologies back in the day. The reason that it probably deserves a seat at this table, in this discussion, is the way that Conflicts are introduced by players specifically and explicitly with the intent that they appeal to the interests of the other players at the table. Since it is GM-less, the antagonism has to be driven by the knowledge of what other people are interested in, and the more the players are interested in that Conflict, the more mechanical narrative power the one who introduces it can harvest when it\u2019s resolved \u2013 even if it\u2019s resolved by someone else. That\u2019s a great set up for an anime-styled game because the mechanical conflicts may not necessarily be directly related to the scene as set. For example, the player responsible for setting the current scene may have described it as a brawl downtown between an army of spider-bots and of the protagonist-heroes while innocent civilians run hither and yon. The Conflicts that hit the table maybe about whether Hiroko can stop thinking about Himiko long enough to protect the civilians hiding in that bank, or Kai can get things taken care of downtown in time for him to get back for his date with Cherry. Or whether Cherry (in her secret identity of Black Whirlwind) can impress Hiroko enough to get her to ask Cherry out for a date so she doesn\u2019t have to go out with Kai.<br/><br/>Okay, I kind of went shojo there for a minute, but you get the idea. There is a whole lot of anime-style just waiting to be mined in <strong>Capes</strong>, and it\u2019s kind of shame that it really hasn\u2019t seen any development since its original release. I think it\u2019s a shame, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434097/#Comment_434097" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-20T07:21:29+00:00" title="June 20, 2014  7:21AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I\u2019m on board with zircher in recommending <strong>Wushu</strong> as a game that it\u2019s hard to get away from as one of the exemplar platforms to do shonen-style stories with in an RPG framework.

I mean, sure, it happens and it's inevitable \u2013 but it's never subtle. And it seems to sort of fall out naturally from the way Wushu rewards you dice for describing elements of your action. After all, no one really wants to be seen as repeating themselves all the time (unless that's their visual motif, which is also pretty amusing when it happens), so describing things in a more and more escalating architecture falls out as an accidental side effect.<br/><br/>(Now I'm trying to think of a shonen anime that doesn't start with all the dials set to 150% and then go to 785% over the course of the first season. Throw in a time skip or a Heroic Blue Screen of Death and you can get to the quad-digit percentage increases in electrons killed for special effects costs in very short order.<br/><br/>But then I tend to like to play characters with the Beat to Hell Trait in Wushu, letting me conveniently described all the ways that I am taking damage, getting thrown around the room, blown against walls, etc. while being effective at dealing with the narrative threat. I like to think of it as John McClain-style.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434113/#Comment_434113" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-20T17:09:39+00:00" title="June 20, 2014  5:09PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a>: Heh, I was pretty concerned about your initial post regarding AP. :P<br/>Personally I really like Pocket Anima Prime even more so... it streamlines what might seem overly crunchy to others into a neat little package.

Which means that not everyone gets all of the Values or necessarily a lot of Relationships.<br/><br/>My thinking there is that while in Smallville you're constantly rubbing up against another main character, and thus generating conflict and drama, shounen anime doesn't exactly have that dynamic. Teamwork and friendships are important, but you don't want to be scrambling to find a Relationship to roll every time. Instead of making it a core element of every roll, I'd make it something that throws in when it's around.

It is pretty much my current go-to game for cool-looking fights that resolve fairly quickly (not like, one or two rolls quickly, but nothing anywhere near a maps&amp;minis D&amp;D/40K/Savage Worlds scrum) where characters are directly incentivized for following their passions and/or genre.  It really is an amazing game that perfectly suits a niche I'd been trying to fill for years.  (Feng Shui used to do an OK job at it, but the more explicit focus on relationship mechanics in TBZ is more to my taste these days, and FS had more outstanding problems with intracharacter balance)\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Carl">@Carl</a> Would you use TBZ as-is or would you need to hack in some character options for a more shonen-type feel?</blockquote>\nIt may need a light reskinning depending on your choice of setting (by default it's basically a technomagic retro-feudal Japan... I can't think of that many manga with such a setting but it's not uncommon in video games and anime, like Nobunaga the Fool, Sengoku Basara/Samurai Kings, etc), but the default character options cover pretty much the gamut of Japanese pop-culture action heroes, with some oddball rarities thrown in.<br/><br/>The one qualm I have about it is that it was designed for one-shots and brief campaigns (like 3-4 sessions), and as such the leveling curve means characters can blast past the starting level (and system's mechanical sweet spot) pretty fast.  While this is great for getting right to the dramatic climax, it does mean that ongoing games can get out of hand quickly, especially if players actively minmax.  I personally think that TBZ does a great job of cramming "the good parts" of an ongoing campaign into 1-3 sessions, so I wouldn't mind just doing a string of unconnected games (or rebuilding PCs periodically instead of just accumulating higher numbers), but mileage may vary.<br/><br/>As far as alternatives mentioned in this thread... I've run Double Cross twice, and while I like a lot of things in it and would run/play again, it's too crunchy for me to really be comfortable with, especially since the main meat of the game, mechanically, is in synergizing your powers to create ultra combos (it is very similar to the way Exalted handles Combos, if you know that).<br/><br/>Anima Prime I really want to like, but there are some weird dead spots in the system you kind of need to know and build PCs around to avoid (by default, it's too easy to have a turn where you effectively do nothing because your dice didn't generate resources, or because your character doesn't have enough powers to spend those resources on and can't donate them to another player, or because you don't have any dice to roll and need to skip your turn to earn more).  I want to try it again, but it's not a high priority.  Interestingly, I just played Mythender over the weekend, which very much seems like an attempt to "fix" those issues I had with AP, and which I enjoyed a lot more as a result.  It does have a really sharp death spiral though (sort of... actual permanent character death is hard to sustain in mid-session, but there's a really high chance you'll lose your character to apotheosis at session's end), so also not ideal for an ongoing game.<br/><br/>I like Smallville/Cortex+ Drama a lot, but to me it feels more ideal for games about characters who may happen to have super-powers, than super-powered characters.  It does a great job of making character drama mechanically interesting, but as a result the super-powers don't feel viscerally exciting.  I haven't tried Marvel/Cortex+ Heroic to see if it solves these problems, mind.<br/><br/>Capes I tried once years ago and don't recall in great detail, but one of the other players described it as having "an artificial scarcity of fun"; it seemed much more about fighting over tokens and narrative control in a very regimented way, whereas the joy of superheroes and battle manga, to me, is in the LACK of that kind of "reasonable" restraint and structure.  They're very visceral, exhilarating genres and I need the (perceived?) freedom to go gonzo and have that seem significant to really enjoy them.  That may be kind of hard to translate into a tabletop RPG, though (and I have yet to find a superhero RPG that satisfies me in that way)...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434235/#Comment_434235" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-23T12:14:39+00:00" title="June 23, 2014 12:14PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><b>Naruto, Bleach</b> You might want to go straight to TBZ for these.

It's something that pops up in the Episode Guides a lot, where it'll talk about an abstract, non-physical Asset that deals with the connection between two characters. It's a really nice touch that brings the relationship aspect of Firefly into the game without putting it front-and-center like Smallville does, compromising the feel of Firefly.

Yeah, it sounds intimidating, but as far as actual mechanics go it's very manageable. One of the books is just art and worldbuilding, and the other isn't just 400 pages of rules (unlike, say, Double Cross). The core system is very simple and while there are a lot of subsystems like ninja magic and mecha piloting, I don't find them anywhere near as detailed or onerous as, say, Shadowrun's decking or casting rules (although I did make gimmick-specific cheat sheets for my players, to cut down on passing the books around).  It's definitely on the rules-lighter side of rules-medium, if that's a sentence that even makes sense.\n<blockquote>I think I mentioned this somewhere on the internet... but I have been tooling around with the conflict mechanics from <b>Dogs in the Vineyard</b> for shonen fighting anime.
