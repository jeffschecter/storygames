I think for many of us it was the first game at Nerdly and for most of the players it was the first time playing Ganakagok.  We played outside starting at 8:30 pm so it got colder and darker as the game progressed.  Never too cold or too dark, but enough to put a chill in the bones.  There were six players:  Jeff, Clinton, Alexander, Terry, Joshua, and Jeffrey.  Respectively, their characters were a fiery hunter, a successful kayaker, a lovelorn hunter, an exiled gatherer, a simple hunter, and a respected shaman.  <br/><br/>We played one round\xe2\u20ac\u201da Night turn\xe2\u20ac\u201das well as the final narration at Morning.  <br/><br/>I learned a lot from GMing this game about how to run Ganakagok better.  Let me pick out the key points and provide an example for them.  First, during character generation it is so important for the characters to have connections or some means to connect.  \xe2\u20ac\u02dcLove\xe2\u20ac\u2122 and \xe2\u20ac\u02dcLore\xe2\u20ac\u2122 seem best for this, but \xe2\u20ac\u02dcGoods\xe2\u20ac\u2122 can work and \xe2\u20ac\u02dcMana\xe2\u20ac\u2122 is a powerful but unreliable tool.  Loves, Lore, Goods, and Mana are the four types of Gifts in the game, each of which allows the players to manipulate the dice in a conflict to help determine the outcome of the conflict.  Loves and Lore seemed the most flexible\xe2\u20ac\u201dassuming the \xe2\u20ac\u02dchelping\xe2\u20ac\u2122 character had a Love with the character in need, or a Lore that applied.  A fun example was the competition between the fiery hunter (Nunichuq) and the lovelorn hunter (Tulutlik)\xe2\u20ac\u201dwho hated each other, but loved the same woman.  As Nunichuq struggled to find the great black bear to prove his worth to his wife, who had confessed to loving Tulutlik, Alexander narrated Tulutlik helping Nunichuq because Nunichuq hated Tulutlik so much for being the object of the wife\xe2\u20ac\u2122s affection.   \xe2\u20ac\u02dcGoods\xe2\u20ac\u2122 can also work although they\xe2\u20ac\u2122re perhaps not as flexible when the characters are apart.  One time it did work was during Joshua\xe2\u20ac\u2122s turn, playing Maqlakap, the simple hunter.  Jeffrey, as Iqilik, the respected shaman, helped Maqlakap by describing a flashback where the shaman gave the hunter a charm that would aid him in his coming task.  The charm, which had been a \xe2\u20ac\u02dcGoods\xe2\u20ac\u2122 in Iqilik\xe2\u20ac\u2122s became a possession of Maqlakap\xe2\u20ac\u2122s.  I did fear that we were having too many moments where players wanted to have their character help, but couldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t.  So, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll try to emphasize the importance of Gifts to being able to help other characters\xe2\u20ac\u201dand encourage use of the rule that allows characters to take more Gifts in conjunction with a greater burden of Bad Medicine.  <br/>Second, get to the real conflict\xe2\u20ac\u201davoid \xe2\u20ac\u02dcbuilding scenes\xe2\u20ac\u2122.  Jeff\xe2\u20ac\u2122s \xe2\u20ac\u02dcfiery hunter\xe2\u20ac\u2122, named Nunichuq, started his turn hunting the great black bear in order to demonstrate his worth to his wife.  The conflict the character faced should have been at least fighting the bear or, even better, facing the choice of killing the bear to keep his undeserving wife or letting the bear live, as it is simply a creature of nature\xe2\u20ac\xa6but instead I suggested that the conflict would be actually just finding the bear\xe2\u20ac\u201dthinking that in the next turn the hunter could fight the bear, and then in the next turn get back to the village, etc.  I realized what a missed opportunity this was during the Morning phase, as each player gets to narrate his or her character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s fate.  Jeff narrated Nunichuq defeating an old and sluggish bear that was really no longer a threat and realizing his actions were unworthy of a hunter\xe2\u20ac\u201dkilling an animal simply to kill rather than to survive.<br/>\tFinally, tie the character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s narratives together during play.  This is the hardest part of Ganakagok\xe2\u20ac\u201dfor me, anyway.  The story is created \xe2\u20ac\u02dcon the fly\xe2\u20ac\u2122 with inspiration from the Ganakagok tarot cards.  In the Nerdly game, Alexander\xe2\u20ac\u2122s lovelorn hunter climbed the \xe2\u20ac\u02dcstairs to the stars\xe2\u20ac\u2122 and used his soul-knife to cut a tear in the sky and pluck out a star\xe2\u20ac\u201dperhaps the one star that would become the new sun.  In Joshua\xe2\u20ac\u2122s later turn, his simple hunter, Maqlakap, encountered a strange underground chamber with a mysterious, inhuman guardian.  Who was the guardian?  It should have been the great black bear or somehow the soul of the star possessed by the lovelorn hunter.  Instead, it was an \xe2\u20ac\u02dcAncient One\xe2\u20ac\u2122 whose nature remains a mystery even now.  He charged Maqlakap with assuming duties as the Guardian lest the people perish\xe2\u20ac\u201dwhich Maqlakap did.  <br/>\tOne other scene I want to mention is the appearance of the cannibal ghouls.  In this episode of the game, we encountered the cannibal ghouls and they were the people!  Fear, hunger, and starvation had come to the village, so the villagers turned on the \xe2\u20ac\u02dcOther\xe2\u20ac\u2122\xe2\u20ac\u201dTerry\xe2\u20ac\u2122s character, Merlavigaq, the exiled gatherer (who was adopted into the village).  The villagers sought to banish Merlavigaq to get rid of one mouth to feed.  Merla was saved, in the end, as Clinton\xe2\u20ac\u2122s character, Tornteek, sacrificed the \xe2\u20ac\u02dcLove\xe2\u20ac\u2122 of his dolphin companion in order to gain Mana to help Merla.  The mob accosting her abruptly gave up their \xe2\u20ac\u02dcwitch-hunt\xe2\u20ac\u2122 as the dolphin leaped onto the shore and the mob saw it as meat.  I thought that was a cool interpretation of the cannibal ghoul situation card.  <br/>\tOne variation I tried distinct from the rules as written is that rather than having the GM read the situation card to describe each character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s starting \xe2\u20ac\u02dcsituation\xe2\u20ac\u2122, I asked the previous player to read the card.  I really enjoy interpreting the cards, so I wanted to provide more opportunities to the players to do so.  <br/>\tSo those are just some highlights from the game.  My thanks to the players who took a chance on an \xe2\u20ac\u0153outdoors, at night\xe2\u20ac\x9d game at Camp Nerdly\xe2\u20ac\u201dthe first of a Ganakagok tradition I hope.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68604/#Comment_68604" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-11T17:20:33+00:00" title="May 11, 2007  5:20PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweeeeet.

You're dead on about getting to the heart of the "conflict." I can totally see it: Fiery hunter goes after the great black bear? Okay, he's a hunter: he tracks that wily old bear down. But the bear knows a few tricks, too: he's scarred and blind in one eye and one ear chewed off, but he's smart. He doubles back on his own tracks and now he smells the fiery hunter and he's coming for him! The old bear rears up and roars and charges, and its great black bulk is death moving like an avalanche  . . . what do you do? The fiery hunter may try to get away or may face him spear in hand (he's fiery, after all), and that's when you flip the consequence card and get the Ancient of Tears, Polar Bear, "to master or overcome." And everybody looks at it and you know if you win the narration that bear mauls the fiery hunter to within an inch of his life, and the fiery hunter knows it too. <br/><br/>Any insights on how you figure out, on the fly, what the "real conflict" is? I suspect it has to do with keeping the character's two-word identity description uppermost in mind, but tell me if you think there's something else.\n<blockquote>Finally, tie the character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s narratives together during play.

That was very gracious.  <br/>Playing oudoors was a neat element.  It definitely contributed to the atmosphere, and I think positively, because it meant we had to devote energy to staying warm, and reading the cards in the reduced light, and playing the game.  It's harder to do things when you're cold.  And we may not have been _cold_ but we were definitely chilly.  So, maybe we were more focused on the game than had we been in a more comfortable environment.  And--this may tie into the 'Band of Siblings' thread, I think there might have been a bit of huddling on the benches for shared body warmth.

Clinton's dolphin sacrifice?<br/> <br/>The Mana was unreliable, as I think is intended, because the players don't know the Mana pool limits.  So they can request Mana, but it may not be available.  We saw this actually with Tulutlik, Alexander's character, who sought to gain 10 points of Mana from , let's say, the Stars Mana pool, but only 6 were available.  So Tulutlik gained the six mana points but also incurred 4 points of Bad Medicine. Furthermore, in later scenes that turn, he had no Mana to draw--the pool was empty.  And because using Mana requires sacrificing a Gift of some kind, it's expensive, too. <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Iskander" title="Iskander"><img alt="Iskander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.ajnewman.net/i/eye.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Iskander">Iskander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68645/#Comment_68645" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-11T21:19:21+00:00" title="May 11, 2007  9:19PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The cold was great. But next year, let's use the fire-pit for atmosphere <i>and</i> comfort!<br/><br/>Ganakagok remains one of my favourite games. There's something primal or elemental about how the stories unfold, and that continually delights me.<br/><br/>I think you should mandate the creation of connections between players through Loves, Hates, Scars, Lore and Mana. Indirect connections of mutual interest (his NPC wife is my unrequited love, her NPC mother is my sister) are adequate.<br/><br/>The hidden-ness of the mana pools was a surprise, but I liked how it played out. Tulutlik was never going to have a happy ending, so balls-to-the-wall hubris seemed appropriate, and having the Mana pool slap back was just fine.<br/><br/>The dolphin sacrificing itself was just great.<br/><br/>Skipping to the real conflict is particularly important in short play. With longer-term play, you have some more leisure to revel in builder scenes, but not in a single session. It would have been a bit more satisfying (and it was already <i>very</i> satisfying) to have played a dusk round where everyone had got the mechanics down. I suspect that the key is using the change-fear and the situation card to spark an immediate situation that requires resolution. There's time and space for some roleplay, but yes, cut to the chase.<br/><br/>I've never yet survived Ganakagok. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68675/#Comment_68675" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-12T08:34:57+00:00" title="May 12, 2007  8:34AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alexander -- That's really gratifying!

I suspect it has to do with keeping the character's two-word identity description uppermost in mind, but tell me if you think there's something else.<br/></blockquote>\nI'd say you and Alexander have hit on it--the conflict is on the character sheet.  It's there in the form of the Burdens--Hates, Fears, Scars, Sins--of the characters, the identity, or the Change Fear, or some combination.  <br/>During the Nerdly game, Alexander narrated the situation for Terry's character, the exiled gatherer.  One of her Burden's was hatred of the tribal elders.  By chance or design, Alexander set up the situation so that Terry's character faced the elders who sought to send her into exile again--as she was not a native to the tribe.  <br/>Clinton set the scene for Alexander's character in a way that Alexander's Love, Apaluq, sent him off into the Ice chasing his Hate, Nunichuq, and his Fear, the great black bear.  While traveling, the character encountered another Fear, an Ancient One, who sought to make him Responsible (another Fear) for the survival of one star that would become the new sun.  We weren't formally trying to tie the story to the Burdens, etc., but I think we picked up some hints and clues from earlier comments by the players about the rationale for character actions.  <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
