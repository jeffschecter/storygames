It's meant to be played in about 30-60 minutes. Being familiar with the story is not necessary to playing the game (I don't think. If you haven't read it and feel like you're missing something important, let me know.)<br/><br/>I'm looking for specific feedback on the Appendices. What other information/suggestions can I provide to help jump start the imagination of the players?<br/><br/>I'm also wondering if the rules section would benefit from a more structured approach to scenes in between the first scene and the Nybas confrontation scene. My assumption is that the question/response dynamic between spirits and dreamer combined with the rolls of spirits will provide enough material that a session won't need much more structure, but I'm open to other opinions.<br/><br/>General feedback is also welcome.<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Isaac" title="Isaac"><img alt="Isaac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Isaac">Isaac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445916/#Comment_445916" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-03T03:31:43+00:00" title="July  3, 2015  3:31AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading it, I'm intrigued. (Also, I've read the story.) (I'm also getting a George MacDonald <i>Phantastes</i> vibe from it. Or perhaps <i>Lilith</i>. Though that may just be through the invocation of the dream-landscape, in which case there are probably several applicable stories to reference.)<br/><br/>For the appendices, my suggestions depend on if you're looking for something a bit concrete, like the fantasy land at the start of the story, or more overtly dreamlike. Maybe some examples of dream logic to inspire the players? Or examples for ways things in the dream can be murky reflections of the aspects of the dreamer? Or, for the concrete side, brief hints about fairytale obstacles (the dome of glass, the hedge of brambles, the shoes that won't stop dancing)? <br/><br/>For the structure, I'd have to feel out how it goes in play. My guess is that it'd work fine as is but might work better by having some portent about the Nybas. Though it depends on how dense the scenes are already, adding more to them may be gilding the lily.<br/><br/>One minor wording suggestion: "making sure everyone gets an even number of rolls" is slightly ambiguous. Did you mean "everyone should have a number of rolls that is divisible by two" or "everyone should try to have approximately the same number of rolls"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
