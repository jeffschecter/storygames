It's got a fair bit to it, so bear with me.<br/><br/><b>Stress</b><br/><br/>-Characters accumulate stress by getting hurt.  Socially, mentally, doesn't matter, it's all stress to this mechanic.<br/><br/>-Stress is represented by pennies.<br/><br/>-You can heal stress with time off, and with other stuff - like voluntary fallout, sort of.<br/><br/>-When you get too much stress, you're forced to shed it in ways depending on <i>the shot that put you over</i>.  If it was a physical hit, you take a scar; if it was a magical one, you get weird, if anything else, you get a bit nuts.  Enough scars, crazyness, whatever, and the character becomes unplayable.<br/><br/>-Stress can, in certain circumstances (based on your drives), be turned into Reflection.  Which is Xp.  This is the only way to get Xp.<br/><br/><b>Confict</b><br/><br/>-There's a list of "maneuvers" that apply to all conflicts.  If you can "lunge", you can "lunge" in a fight, a chase, a social confrontation, all that.  These maneuvers are <i>personality bits</i>; when you pick maneuvers, you're telling the group that your character is aggressive / defensive / flailing / team-oriented / whatever.<br/><br/>-In a conflict round, you distribute your stress in little piles; you pick up to three maneuvers for the round, and distribute your pennies on them.  The more stress you put on a maneuver, the more impressive your performance.  There's no dice; everyone does this simultaneously, and then the round resolves with descriptions as the actions "go off".<br/><br/>...Now, there's all kinds of weird emergent shit going on here.  And I like most of it - the potential desire to "run hot" because stress makes you more effective, the weird possible brinkmanship games that could be played, the idea that characters will never "just die" but will degrade, all that.  <br/><br/>But, really, I'm wondering if this is just too "gimmicky"?<br/><br/>Anyone?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120731/#Comment_120731" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-20T10:48:36+00:00" title="January 20, 2008 10:48AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite>But, really, I'm wondering if this is just too "gimmicky"?</blockquote>\nNot by a longshot.

I will note that some players who value immersion find the sort of metagame thinking involved in the decision process of where to place your pennies annoying because they'd have to break immersion in order to make that decision, particularly if the situation would reward clever strategy and tactics in this allocation.  For people who don't have that particular problem, I would think it'd be fine as long as it could be done in under 30 seconds each time.  If players spend several minutes agonizing over their allocations (or worse, <i>some</i> players do and some do not), it could get annoying.<br/><br/>All of which doesn't exactly address the issue of "gimmicky", does it?  Personally, I would not find it too gimmicky -- you're just giving a mechanical representation of your character's internal state, which strikes me a perfectly reasonable thing for a game to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120737/#Comment_120737" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-20T10:58:50+00:00" title="January 20, 2008 10:58AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2008 10:59AM by Joe Murphy.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some of your stuff's plenty gimmicky, but not this, IMHO. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/><br/><br/>It's not all that far from balancing Exhaustion with everything else in DRYH.

Maybe?  I mean, the setting here is what happens when the big city politico and the mustachio-twirling landlord are in cahoots with the mad scientist of doom, and their ultimate goal is <b>world domination</b>.<br/><br/>But the rebels <i>aren't about that</i>, really.  The "world domination" is not their big worry.<br/><br/>The geezer in the corner, with the outdated etherobolt pistol and the ridiculous flight cap, he's in this because the mad scientist's factory, approved by the politico, is where his son was knocked into a churning vat and boiled to death, and nobody in charge cares about that.<br/><br/>The jittering clockwork man - the Cog - talking with him?  He wants to be recognized by the politicos as a person of sorts, with rights.  Not even equal rights, necessarily.  Just, well, some rights.<br/><br/>And the scrappy-but-cute newspaper kid eating everything on the table is here because when they tried to put her in a workhouse for living on the street, she jammed a broken broomstick into the eye of the come-along-wagon's driver, and they're after her.<br/><br/>Those are pretty basic characters.

And you, in the audience, go dead cold.  Within ten minutes, again, the little bunnies are back to bouncing around and being cute. And it's still fun and kind of silly.  Even cartoony.  But you <i>know</i> it could happen again, that it probably will, and the entire world has this sinister edge even while the happy bouncy bunnies are skipping along.<br/><br/>That.
