It reminded me that John Harper had whipped up that character sheet a while back, and so I am trudging through a more comprehensive conversion/hack.  If I can keep with it I am sure I will run into more issues but the first and largest is finding an analog to 'seasons.'<br/><br/>It is a superb pacing mechanism for the MG system and I think that if used correctly it could be for SR also.  The brainstorm ideas I've had that stood up to rudimentary review are:<br/>1.  A simple Mission/Downtime rotation, where the more missions you undertake between downtime counter a 'cost of living/maintaining SOTA' tax for downtime, at the risk of insufficient recovery time and probably increasing Mission Rating/check boxes (I am thinking higher rating missions have a better payoff, generally).<br/>2.  Subdivide the mission.  First phase is recruit, research, recon, plan; second phase is approach, infiltrate, execute, retreat; phase three is regroup, deliver, get paid, debrief; phase four is downtime.<br/>3.  A 'Shadow Heat' cycle: Business as Usual, Easy Money/Milk Runs, Big Scores, Too Much Heat.<br/>4.  A 'conspiracy' cycle: The Pledge, The Turn, The Prestige.<br/><br/>With each of these comes the question of an analogous Weather Watcher skill and what it would affect.<br/><br/>Any help would be great.  I've only run MG a few times, so my familiarity with any kind of emergent property of the season cycle is nil.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384773/#Comment_384773" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-10T18:15:11+00:00" title="July 10, 2012  6:15PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When John and I were playing a 1-on-1 black ops game using MG, I replaced the seasons with varying levels of danger and friction. Each mission started with a certain level of friction, and then, when we made certain rolls (the equivilent of Weather-Watcher in MG), there was the potential for the "season" to change, for the sitution to get thornier or easier. That sounds a bit like your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> above. We only made it through one arc, however, so I can't really speak to how it worked over the long term.

My thinking is, classic SR is pretty procedural, right? Like, the bulk of a session of SR is the actual doing-of-the-mission. Not saying that that's where you should put your hack's focus, just asking if that's how you want it to play out.<br/><br/>The mix of mission-to-personal will impact your season and Turn rules. I like <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> very much if you want to play out your procedural, and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> if it's kind of more about the lives of runners.<br/><br/>I also like JWalt's thing about accumulating friction, and I'll bet you could touch on your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> in that way: the conspiracy deepens as a Twist on failure.<br/><br/>Perhaps you could have, kind of like weather twist economy in MG (more weather twists in the spring and winter, less in the summer and fall), a "fuck-over" economy tied to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>. Easy money means fewer fuckovers, while Big Scores and Too Much Heat mean more fuck-over twists. But they still constrain the GM so that not every single twist ends up fucking the team over with an ever-more-preposterous conspiracy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson" title="d.anderson"><img alt="d.anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson">d.anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384783/#Comment_384783" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-10T20:12:03+00:00" title="July 10, 2012  8:12PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Procedural, mostly.  I feel pretty strongly that SR is a lousy setting to really explore relationships (though they make for great opportunities and constraints); same goes for social sci-fi issues (bigotry, privilege, transhumanism, etc).  The basic premise is a bit silly but it really sparks my imagination for escapist semi-pro criminal grey-ops jobs (too much Burn Notice lately), with the explicit methodology of MG to make them naturally messy without everyone looking like incompetents.<br/><br/>I am thinking, at this point, that the weather twist economy will derive from Edge (nature), Cred (resources), and possibly Circles tests.  So many times getting taxed or the enmity clause and the season-analog shifts.  I don't know that there will be a Weather Watcher equivalent - the broad hazard types aren't fleshed out yet.<br/><br/>Sorry if I wasn't clear - Too Much Heat would be like Winter (usually downtime, though you can try runs if you like).

That said, I had been thinking about cash dice as per BW.  Most everything else will be Traits of one sort or another.  I'd really like to keep the details of the game as we play relevant, but some of that stuff is going to have to be essentially description arising from the inspiration of the moment rather than codified rules.  It was my experience that MG twists and conditions, in particular, gave rise to those details and framed the way the players could respond to them (like, drug use being the explanation for a condition, then later a trait vote).<br/><br/>It is looking like option <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> is becoming my favorite, despite the mission focus.

The mission/team focus, the authority figure who hands out a job, the breakdown between professional and personal effort. Nature is tricky, but it's always tricky despite what certain unnamed designers whose names start with L might say. The Nature-Mission-BIG triangle is probably the hardest to work through, mostly because traditional cyberpunk characters are so deliberately flat. But that's a limitation/feature of the genre, not the engine. <br/><br/>Examples of character-driven cpunk literature would be useful to look at. I used to be totally bonkers for the genre but not for character reasons. I think I'd be more drawn to examples in the modern vein, <i>Takeshi Kovaks</i> type stuff, but even then characterization is perilously thin.<br/><br/>But once you do have the triangle worked out, it then seems trivially easy to strap fantasy races (which is really just racism in drag, like always) and magic (which in SR is fundamentally just another tech) onto the whole thing. The equipment/upgrade list would be a crapton of work and I, personally, really dislike putting my energies into that sort of thing. I'm helping BWHQ with a project right now that happens to be equipment-heavy, and the spreadsheet makes my head spin.

I have not played with it!  But my theory is that it is a dangerous trap, when your edge pretty specifically doesn't cover fighting or building real relationships.  The characters will be good shadowrunners, which is great, but the desire to use the hammer all the time will lead to tax and the need for recovery, and drifting toward the sociopathic Traits and being taken out of play until you can play nicely with others at 7; it is part of the GMs job to provide obstacles worthy of being challenged, both in terms of substantial and justified Ob ratings, and in terms of hard choices (like, using my Nature or addressing my BIGs).<br/><br/>Shadowrunners aren't mice, though.  They are supposed to be badeasses that are admittedly up against long odds, and more or less good at what they do.  In this version, at least!  Despite the shift, I think MG will hold up fine - as I said above, the twists and conditions let 'runs go bad without bringing them to a screeching halt.  Having Nature be up-front what being a runner is about will push things that direction; if I were interested in a more dramatically sophisticated premise then I'd use Edge (Metahuman) and tag it with (off the top of my head) something like Being Passionate, Being Opinionated, Being Bought.  Ok, those aren't great, but you know, something orthogonal to being a runner that pushes toward a bigger picture and opens the field for character exploration and thematic expression.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_384863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384863/#Comment_384863" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-11T17:37:35+00:00" title="July 11, 2012  5:37PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Nature is tough.

I tried the latter in a game about post-apocalyptic Valkyries, where Nature was murder, flying, and dealing with ghosts and it didn't work out so well.

The first is information the characters should know, which is up-front or for the asking.  The second is information the characters will need to know, which will be an obstacle and test as normal (resulting in Conditions, Twists, or of course even possibly success), or might be the natural return on following through on an Instinct.  The third is through spending checks in the player's turn.  These are what I can think of off the top of my head.<br/><br/>But admittedly the focus is the mission, where the legwork either pays off, is useless, or turns out to be a liability.  Treating the results of useful legwork properly implemented as a gear bonus is the simplest method.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385758/#Comment_385758" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-25T12:38:25+00:00" title="July 25, 2012 12:38PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I might fold certain categories of prior legwork into attack/defense/feint/maneuver bonuses for a custom Conflict type: Heist or whatever.

That could be really hot, as long as the players were on board with pulling the action back a bit and, rather that succeeding or failing at each step's skill check, you're just whittling away at the Heist's dispo.
