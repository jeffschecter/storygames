The last time we did this was about a year ago, and we ended up playing most of the pitched games. This is a happy model, because it gets early buy-in, distributes responsibility for organizing and prepping games, and removes any "what do we do next?" fumbling around. We know what to do next - we've got a line-up.<br/><br/>I'm super excited about what everyone brought to the pitch session this time - we're in alignment about things we're interested in and none of the ideas got a lukewarm response. Here is what we'll be doing:<br/><br/>1. A gritty horror game focusing on paranoia, claustrophobia and cosmic secrets set on the first manned expedition to Mercury. Soundtrack by Lustmord. PTA.<br/><br/>2. A massive diamond heist in contemporary Antwerp by an international crew who really can't afford to fail. Possibly Solar System.<br/><br/>3.<i> The Tower,</i> survival horror set in a geriatric care facility. As characters die, the stable of GMs grows. Probably a homebrew. <br/><br/>4. A team of Mossad agents track down fugitive Nazis in the 1970s. Their prey are monsters who are monsters, however - failed super-soldiers, men who sweat poison, various other weird aberrations. Custom rules.<br/><br/>5. Dirt Track, a PTA game set in Wilkes County, North Carolina, in the waning days of moonshining and the glory days of wide-open big-mill NASCAR. The season ends with the opening of the Daytona Speedway. Soundtrack by Little Jimmy Dickens.<br/><br/>6. The Little Store, season 3 of our PTA series about the Russian Mafiya in America. At the end of season 2 Yakov betrayed the Organizatsiya and entered the witness protection program. Now he's running a gas station deep in America's heartland - will old ghosts come calling? What could bring him back to Brighton Beach?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273096/#Comment_273096" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T06:00:03+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  6:00AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason those sound awesome, especially 1 and 3.

Many are tied to issues, so they may in fact be redeemed at the player's option. I have a feeling few will go that route.<br/><br/>Some thoughts on the problem piece ... here's what one player wrote:<br/><br/>"Brian Rodriguez's calm, cool demeanor made him an excellent choice as command pilot for the DL-2 mission. He was excited to be a part of such an important event in mankind's history. He was also excited that Galina Soboleva, the mission's astronomer, had been chosen for DL-3. Galina was young, spirited and attractive. The first time they hooked up was an accident. Fraternization amongst the crew was strictly forbidden. They had been careful, though, to hide the relationship developing between them.<br/><br/>Rodriguez never considered himself a jealous man, but with a predominantly male crew and such an attractive woman, a certain mistrust would only be natural, right?<br/><br/>NAME: Brian Rodriguez (USA)<br/>PRIMARY MISSION ROLE: Command Pilot<br/>SECONDARY MISSION ROLE: Astronomy field systems engineer (FSE)<br/>PROBLEM: attraction<br/>EDGES/CONNECTIONS: Galina Soboleva, quick reflexes, observant<br/>ISSUE: jealousy"<br/><br/>So the problem is just an additional issue, really, or even a gloss on the issue. There's no mechanical weight to it, just a framework I can poke at and an arc the player can move along. I wanted to have each player choose a destructive path, regardless of their character concept.<br/><br/>Here's another:<br/><br/>"NAME: Ronald Luo  (China 2)<br/>PRIMARY MISSION ROLE: Environmental Control and Life Support engineer<br/>SECONDARY MISSION ROLE: Medical technician<br/>PROBLEM: Competitiveness<br/>EDGES/CONNECTIONS: That's not how we do it at home, Nangong Jie, Deep Pockets<br/>ISSUE: Burning bridges<br/><br/>Ronald was born in Taiwan to an Americian father and a Chinese mother. He has spent most of his life and education in America but when it became obvious that he would not get the American spot he switched to his mothers citizenship despite the fact that he learned to speak Chinese last year. Ronald is very competitive with Mission Commander Jie.  ECLS was his second choice.  He also has strange ideas about how Commander Jie should be doing her job in support of ECLS. His selection was highly political and controversial but within the letter of the international crew selection agreement, to China's fury - Luo has the support of several Taiwanese manufacturing conglomerates as well as dissident factions within the PLAN"<br/><br/>What I'm learning is that injecting an obvious destructive problem into character concepts is doing all my work for me. The season will start with a toxic atmosphere inside Chao Meng Fu base poised to explode.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge" title="EarthenForge"><img alt="EarthenForge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge">EarthenForge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274252/#Comment_274252" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-03T08:01:54+00:00" title="June  3, 2010  8:01AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the group pitch sessions idea.
