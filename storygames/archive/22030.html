<p>As per <a href="/forums/profile/ebear%E2%80%99s">@ebear’s</a> request, let’s move out this subthread from <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22028/west-marches-how-do-they-get-back-home-every-time/p1" rel="nofollow">[West Marches] How do they get back home every time?</a>.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ebear" rel="nofollow">ebear</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>(The other Q was if replacement characters, if PCs die, should be same level as the rest of the group or start at a lower level – again, I told them that we’ve tried both &amp; both had some serious cons – I guess I wasn’t selling D&amp;D particularly well <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/>)</p></div></blockquote>Curious on what the pros/cons were here as I’m looking to run a higher lethality game in the near future and have been wondering about this very thing, but that’s a different topic all together.</div></blockquote><p>I personally think that for OSR style, open-ended games, starting over at the bottom works best. In D&amp;D, it’s pretty quick to <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/almost_catching_up/" rel="nofollow">almost catch up</a> in a mixed level party, and if everyone died we all get to have that low-level fun again. D&amp;D is set up so that it’s really really hard to survive the first few levels and really really hard to die after a while. In some environments, level 1 and 2 are <em>really</em> dangerous so for some campaigns I like the (house) rule that once everyone’s in the party’s been level 3, level 3 becomes the new baseline. You may start at level 1 or 2 if you wish but with the XP you need to go to 3. In some other environments I’m like “there’s plenty of things for level ones to do around here” and that’s where you go. This is something we usually decide up front for the campaign.</p><p>Right now we’re running a module where it says explicitly “A replacement character should be the same level as the rest of the party”. The pro of that is that even though this module is one of the biggest sandboxes I’ve ran outside of aQ [no, not because of the “sand” pun, but because of the thoroughness of the 2e boxes], they can say “who cares about the maguffin, let’s take up life as pirates!” or w/e (there’s even a whole <em>other</em> level 1-16 campaign going on separately in another of the ruined cities here), the module also has a schtick that prevents resurrection magic from working and if they want to make headway towards the maguffin [again, the module doesn’t funnel them there, but they are strongly motivated to try to find it, go there, and do something about it], starting over would’ve been hopeless.</p><p>I also interpreted “the same level” as the party’s <em>highest</em> level which was a mistake. Lowest or average or median would’ve been better.</p><h2 id="same-level">Same level</h2><p><em>(Either party’s highest level, party’s average level, party’s lowest level)</em></p><ul><li>Makes it so that sometimes the best way to advance is to die, unless you go “party’s lowest level”</li><li>Makes it possible (too easy?) to pursue high level goals &amp; maguffins</li><li>Makes it easier to be level-appropriate</li><li>Can come up with more elaborate backstory. “Oh mad one! We beseech you for help. We’ve heard you’re the strongest witch in the land!” “Yep I’m level 7 with the Fey Pact of the Tome so you’ve come to the right place!”</li><li>Jumping to the same level as the rest of the party sometimes makes it feel not earned</li></ul><h2 id="lower-level">Lower level</h2><p><em>(Either start over at level 1, or if there are “tier lines” that the party can cross that then become the new starting level.)</em></p><ul><li>Makes you learn the new class properly &amp; gradually</li><li>In a mega dungeon sometimes you run out of low-level enemies to help you level up, once you’ve cleared the first floors</li><li>I love heavy-logistics low level play: water, light, food, sleep, getting lost</li><li>Coat-tailing as a level one with a high-level party sometimes feel pretty bad too</li></ul><h2 id="same-level-but-zero-xp-so-takes-a-toll-on-your-advancement-rate">Same level, but zero XP so takes a toll on your advancement rate</h2><ul><li>I’ve never tried this</li><li>Can contribute right away</li><li>Stronger consequence of death than in the “same level” sitch</li><li>Stuck for a long time before seeing any variety to the character</li><li>OTOH, you are stuck at level six [or w/e] as opposed to being level one, level three, level five, level six – and a level six can do all the things a level three can (for example)</li><li>Talking to <a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">@Aviatrix</a> about this, she said she had played in a game like that and it sucked. I tried to <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/almost_catching_up/" rel="nofollow">dazzle her with the math</a> but in the end while it has some pros of both worlds it also has some of the cons of both.</li></ul><h2 id="start-over-but-get-more-xp-so-can-catch-up">Start over, but get more XP so can catch up</h2><p>I’ve never tried this either, this is something I came up with just now (see, these kindsa thread <em>can</em> lead to design happening) Thinking of putting it in the player’s hands, with a rule such as this. You can give away XP to other players (most likely for the purps of you want them to level up faster than you, maybe if you’re ahead of them) as long as they haven’t received more “gift” XP than they had earned normally. I.e. a party of Bob, Carol, Ted and Alice gets 200 xp each. Ted gives Alice 100xp more from his own share. Alice couldn’t receive more than 200 total as gifts this way until she earns more xp normally idk I’m just brainstorming.</p><h2 id="about-gaining-more-levels-at-once">About “gaining more levels at once”</h2><p>I wanted to touch on the “Gaining more levels at once”; many version of D&amp;D has a rule that if you were to gain more more XP than you need to go to the next level, the excess XP is lost. I guess for when you find a ginormous treasure trove and use XP for treasure system. That rule is not in 5e (and I’m not about to houserule it back in, I don’t like the rule), but if you’re using a version that has that rule, here’s how I’d tweak it: the rule would only apply to people going to a level beyond the party’s currently highest level.</p> </div>

<p>I forgot to say that <b>for guest characters they do start at the party level</b>. If someone is just jumping in for one night I’ll let them have a party-appropriate level.

                            That's a nice summary of the issue, Sandra.<br/><br/>I would never consider doing anything but starting over at level 1 for a challengeful old school-ish game; it's such a fundamental part of the experience to me. I won't acknowledge a game that gives free levels as legitimate. The game advancement math (geometric level progression) supports this very well, allowing a lower-level character to catch up  to higher-level ones without any additional complication.<br/><br/>For a new school game it's simplest to have everybody be same level; I haven't found reason to struggle against the expectation. I recommend dropping the xp mechanics as well, though, as without characters advancing at different pace it's simply not worth the trouble; much easier to just tell the players when to level up.<br/><br/>My old school sandboxes start guest players at 1st level as well. It's just part of the underlying fundamental ethos: "The game <b>must</b> be fun at 1st level, if it's not I am doing something wrong." Having anybody start at 1st level always is a hygienic principle in this regard: it helps me keep it real by forcing me to maintain a meaningful, fun sandbox game accessible to 1st level characters. They come first, the occasional mid-level veterans are the exceptions that gain their exceptional aura by traipsing around in the low-level world with all their low-level fellow adventurers.                        </div>

Either go by playing time (count hours or sessions or w/e, never tried anything like that though) or do full XP.</p><p>A lot of problems that other DMs report, such as fudging dice or hp, or players getting angry b/c TPK, or DMs getting frustrated b/c they can’t challenge the players, go away in a sandbox because you’re no longer serving up the encounters to them. They seek out the encounters themselves (no, not in a “Czege principle” violating way but by going out in the Dangerous Forest) and it becomes an economic game. “How much Level do we need before we can go to Area?” becomes the recurring question. And their player skill, ingenuity in bypassing monsters, their luck on encounter tables, their builds etc all become super relevant.</p><p>When DM serves out the levels to suit the (upcoming) encounters, that’s almost as bad as the DM serving out the encounters to suit the player’s levels. You become reliant on challenge ratings or fudging or whatever, or if you refuse those things (which I do) you deserve the ire of the players when things go wrong. If you served the dish, you’re accountable for the recipe. If they serve themselves, by being in control of both their own opposition (through where they go or who they make enemies with) and their abilities (through earning experience), everyone can just eat to their own liking and have a good time.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>My old school sandboxes start guest players at 1st level as well.

Eero, if we were to play in each other’s sandboxes I’m sure we’d start each other off at level 1 because that’s the experience we want to have; actually being part of the game world from day one of our adventuring careers. When my sister comes here to Sweden I’m more than happy to have her contribute with a powerful &amp; simple-to-use character. She doesn’t play D&amp;D regularly, we grew up with Hero Quest [the British one, not the Robin Laws one], Magic the Gathering, Cosmic Encounter, Zelda video games, and (above all) Lost Valley of the Dinosaurs, our fave, where we spent hours exploring hex by hex with tons of house rules. If she gets into more regular D&amp;D (she’s played with us like four times, with about a year between occasions) that’d be another thing. IDK.</p><p>In my headcanon she’s this wandering Elminster type figure that shows up every now and then. I mean she always plays new characters but you get the idea.</p><p>All that said, this:</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Having anybody start at 1st level always is a hygienic principle in this regard: it helps me keep it real by forcing me to maintain a meaningful, fun sandbox game accessible to 1st level characters.</p></div></blockquote><p><em>is</em> a strong argument.

                            I really like this take on the topic: you're really covering the issue very thoroughly.<br/><br/>My own approach (in my house ruled D&amp;D) is to make character advancement much more gradual, so mixing levels isn't such a difficult issue - they're small incremental changes instead of big leaps in power.<br/><br/>Sandra, your idea of "passing around XP as a gift" is pretty interesting.

                            The idea that higher-level characters should gain less XP for the same deeds than lower-levels was introduced in AD&amp;D, I think. There weren't firm rules for it at that point, but I seem to remember something very gygaxian about not awarding XP for "non-challenging" adventures, or something of the sort. It's an old DM worry - what to do if the players play over-leveled characters and trivialize the adventure that way.<br/><br/>The WotC 3rd edition, on the other hand, has explicit rules for how a character's XP gains get prorated: there's a table that you use to correlate a monster's CR (you basically only get XP for monster-slaying in 3rd) with the adventurer's level, and if the adventurer's level is higher than the monster's CR, then that monster's not as valuable. For example, a 4th level character gets 600 xp for a CR 2 monster, while an 8th level character gets just 300. The hilarious part is that in an encounter with multiple adventurers and multiple monsters (not very uncommon, that) you're supposed to reference the table for each adventurer-monster pair separately, which can be a bit of work I imagine.<br/><br/>If I were to DM 3rd edition in a more old school style (for a reason I can't quite fathom right now), with sandboxes and character stables and all, I would actually use that devaluation rule despite its ugliness; 3rd edition XP tables have very weak inherent inflation compared to the geometric series used in 20th century D&amp;D, which means that low-level characters don't catch up to high-level ones on their own. It's actually a very different design compared to the original, math-wise.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I don't recommend stacking multiple layers of rules for fine-tuning something like XP awards. Either every level-up costs 1000 XP (or whatever) no matter your level, but it's more difficult to gain points at higher levels, or you do something like Gygax and halve the value of the individual point every level by demanding more and more of them as you go up. Either way works, but combining them together is pretty dim, I think; a good example of the fake complexity that guides modern D&amp;D design.                        </div>

                            Yeah, that's a fundamental reason why I think that old-style D&amp;D (something resembling Basic) can aspire to not caring about this issue. I don't think that it's entirely obvious, and I think that you need specific techniques of play to achieve the ideal, but in certain editions of Basic you hardly need to worry about adventures being "too easy to count". Apparently it's a phenomenon that became a concern for D&amp;D authors at some point, but to me it seems like the cure is sometimes worse than the disease.<br/><br/>The key mechanical issues in having a D&amp;D where low-level dangers aren't <i>too</i> easy for higher-level characters are the existence or non-existence of critical hits and/or fumbles and whether AC has hard limits. (Consider this: original D&amp;D basically doesn't have AC scaling at all - a mid-level character adventures with the same armor a 1st-leveler does.)<br/><br/>A D&amp;D where lower-level adventures are still potentially dangerous to higher-level characters doesn't need too much in the way of penalties for being over-leveled: the natural penalty of a low-level adventure not being worth that many points is enough, as the character takes a real risk in participating in the adventure anyway. If you're going to risk your neck, you should do it for an amount of points that might help you level up.<br/><br/>In my own sandboxes I make a point of fine-tuning the rules in such a way that low-level adventures are the best choice for low-level adventurers and mid-level adventures are the best choice for mid-level adventurers. This is pretty simple to achieve as long as you manage two things:<br/><b>*</b> A mid-level character can still die in a low-level adventure because the combat system is sufficiently lethal and uncertain. Doesn't need to be as likely as it is for a low-level character, but it has to be a concern.<br/><b>*</b> Mid-level adventures have better payouts, but there are gate-keeping concerns that tend to keep low-level adventurers out: expeditions to mid-level locations are more expensive, or only reputable adventurers with the right contacts can get the hook.<br/><br/>If both of those are true, then a mid-level adventurer shouldn't be slumming it out with low-levelers too much: a more valuable character should be doing a better class of adventure altogether.<br/><br/>A pro tip: D&amp;D traditionally has dungeon features that are dangerous to higher level characters as well; not everything scales neatly, and some things simply scale pretty slowly. The absolutely simplest way to ensure that low-level dungeons are too dangerous for a valuable character is to scatter a liberal amount of poisonous save-or-die snakes everywhere. That's the sort of place where you'd rather pay a poor 1st level bastard to delve so you don't have to go there yourself.<br/><br/>In general I'm of the opinion that here, as well as in other places in the D&amp;D chassis, the designer is best served by reducing the ever-creeping idea of numbers advancement. D&amp;D has at its core the wonderfully powerful concept of the Hit Point pool, which already grows linearly as characters advance and makes leveled characters extremely robust and therefore effective. I am uncertain whether there are <i>any</i> numbers in the resolution system that need to grow on top of that, or if it's all just fake progress.                        </div>

                            First of all thank you all for this thread, hearing about all of your experiences has really been enlightening. I definitely made the mistake of trying to hand out XP basically on GM fiat and would probably never do that again. This time I'm doing level ups based on attendance in my west marches style 5e office game and it's definitely an improvement. I want to try out XP for gold with whatever we play next and see what that's like.

I've started to realize over the past couple of months that the things that I whine and complain about with regards to 5e are <b>not</b> actually things that have to do with the system.

Until recently I was being a huge baby about HP progression. By the time characters got to level 4-5 I would start saying things to myself like "This combat encounter is so long and it doesn't really feel like the characters are even in danger". I attributed it to 5e giving characters and monsters to much HP but I think that's baloney now. For one thing I could have had the players roll for their HP and I chose not to. I was also doing things like only stocking dungeons with "level appropriate" monsters. And even worse I stopped rolling for random encounters because I was so tired of these endless combat sequences where nothing seemed to be at stake. Of course that snowballed because without the random encounters they basically walked into static encounters with all of their resources and just brushed through them.<br/><br/>The thing I latched onto when reading stuff like B/X or LL is that a red dragon has about 40hp and I said "Aha! I this is the secret to fast and exciting combat!" Of course that doesn't make any sense because the damage dealt in those games are relatively scaled down as well (is it proportional? I have no idea).<br/><br/>Anyway things are going better this time around with my current game but there is still plenty of room for improvement. I think I need to be more proactive about tweaking the system and my play style and actually observing the effects of those changes the way <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> does on this forum. It's very inspiring.<br/><br/>(Also playing B/X and LL for real rather than in my head probably would probably be a helpful learning experience as well)                        </div>

                            A sidenote:<br/><br/>I know that Ben Robbins said that in the West Marches, new characters would start at 1st level. However, after the game matured some and had more high-level characters, they switched over to new characters being half the level of the previous character.<br/><br/>In successful games in this style I've seen, however, there was often a "character stable" kind of approach, which meant players also had to choose which characters to send on adventures. Will you use the powerful character? Then you're risking them (what if they die?), and the "newbies" won't get to level up. Maybe it would be better to try to get everyone to a reasonable level, instead of putting all your eggs in one basket... It's a gamble and a bit of a juggling act.                        </div>

                            Oh, I should address my heretical (but still untested) version of leveling up:<br/><br/>I'm building a version of D&amp;D that does away with linear HP increases. Basically the opposite of what D&amp;D5 does: as you level up, you get better at doing all kinds of things, but you only become less fragile very gradually. The most you can end up with in terms of hit points is about 3x the starting amount (so, a "high-level" character in my version of D&amp;D is like a more competent and skilled 3rd level character in normal D&amp;D - somewhere in the realm of a 10th level 5E character in terms of aptitude but with the hit points of a 3rd-level character).<br/><br/>My hope is that it keeps the game exciting and avoids that "slugfest" effect D&amp;D can sometimes have. Even terrifying monsters can be brought down by a few powerful blows, if you're brave enough!<br/><br/>(The "E6" rules for 3E were a little like this, where D&amp;D characters maxed out at 6th level. e.g. <a href="https://dungeons.fandom.com/wiki/E6_(3.5e_Sourcebook)/Introduction" rel="nofollow">https://dungeons.fandom.com/wiki/E6_(3.5e_Sourcebook)/Introduction</a> </div>

<p>Wait, what? I thought you had a different model of HP and wounds already [since you saw it as meat points and you didn’t want the gradual chopping down &amp; yelling “timber!” of a “slug fest”] so what’s the point of this?</p><p>I can get behind a game, like Diaspora or Traveller or Cthulhu Dark, where you don’t really get better. I think that’s a great idea that solves a lot of things.</p><p>But if you <i>are</i> getting better, and I’ve had great experiences with 5e and getting better and the zero-to-hero thing, I think increasing HP &amp; damage output is the way to go.</p><p>1 skeleton is dangerous to a level 1 hero. 17 skeletons are dangerous to a level 9 hero. The exact same statblock. Really great for sandbox games, I don’t have to do the 4E “this is a level 14 goblin”.</p><p>(“But wait, Sandra. Chance of hitting does affect damage output directly. If my AC went up instead of my HP went up, it could be done with careful math etc such that we got the same effect as 5e has.” And yes maybe I’d do it. In my <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22032/d-d-things-i-wouldve-done-different-than-5e/p1" rel="nofollow">“Things I would’ve done different than 5e”</a> thread, I might do away with HP and just have one hit one kill and just set the difficulty &amp; ac enough that it takes a couple of clang-clang-clang until you hit. It’s difficult to do with the course granularity [<em>not swingingess</em>] of a d20 but any die can have its granularity become more fine with the addition of tie-breaker dice. I.e. you need to roll over 17.34; you roll a d20 which is fine 95% of the time but if you land on 17 you have to roll some tie-breaker dice.)</p> </div>

                            Well, I'm doing something like "bounded accuracy" (which I think is a ridiculous term, but hey!) and a reduced scale for hit points... it's just that the hit point scaling is even more "bounded". <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>EDIT: Oh, and, on top of that, hit dice are rolled when you get hit, so you're never 100% safe, anyway.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, so long as AC doesn't change too much (and in my rules it would change very little), it's no big deal. Everything else can scale pretty safely, except maybe saving throws (depending on how common "save negates" stuff is in the ruleset).<br/><br/>If your high-level character goes toe-to-toe with a real bad opponent, he's still fragile - the difference is that, if he does, he can hit that opponent pretty much all the time. Your thief can climb all the walls and steal all the gems, but you can still stab him to death. And so on.<br/><br/>(Or are there some real, serious objections to this model? I'm not aware of any, but I wouldn't rule them out, so hit me up if you have some!)                        </div>

                            It's way easier to scale getting better with HP increases than with AC increases because you have finer granularity.<br/><br/>Assuming a 3e style ascending AC system, an AC increase of one single point is the equivalent of an HP increase of [average damage per attack that hits × number of attacks per day].<br/>So let's say you're fighting skeletons, who hit for 5 damage. If you fight what the DMG says is a reasonable number of skeletons in a day, which is 48 skeletons for a party of four level 4 characters (eight per fight, two fights per short rest, three such periods per day), an AC increase of one point is the equivalent of an increase of twelve hp. If you're at level eight and are fighting the prescribed amount of 24 skeletons per fight, 144 per day, an AC increase of one point is instead the equivalent of an increase of 36 hp. So as you can see the scaling, when scaling AC rather than HP, is non linear. That's why it's better to scale HP than to scale AC.<br/><br/>Another argument in favor of having AC bound tighter than HP is because you get bigger &amp; bigger AoE spells that hit more and more targets.<br/><br/>(Again, as you know, I don't serve up "prescribed amounts of skeletons"; I run a world and there are monsters in it that the players have their characters stumble upon or seek out. This is just to show some of the math probs with AC.)<br/><br/>It's the equiv argument of "why can't there be giant humans and giant bugs" well because mass increase at a different rate than area as you go up in size.<br/><br/><br/> </div>

                            Oh, sure. The part that I'm not doing, though, is increasing AC. No thank you, for the very reasons you mention. Combat math is much more like 5E in that sense. (In fact, AC is probably even more tightly bound in my rules than in 5E... hard to say, because I'm using a different mechanic for that altogether.)                        </div>

                            Hmmmm. That's true, yes. But... either I am too tired or you're twisting my brain around. Wouldn't these numbers depend on the expected number of monsters and attacks, as well as the typical damage output?<br/><br/>For example, if you're fighting 100+ skeletons per day, as you suggest, HP can be adjusted in a more subtle fashion. But if the numbers are smaller (like they are in a B/X or OD&amp;D context), then the reverse seems to be true - a 5% difference to-hit can be a smaller effect than an extra hit point.<br/><br/>And does this matter, in any case? Why is this important? For instance, we could scale up all damage and hit point numbers by a factor of 10, and thereby get even finer granularity.  Or we could roll percentile dice instead a d20 to hit. Does either of those somehow improve the game for us? <br/><br/>Maybe I'm just being slow, of course.<br/><br/>You're saying that AC modifiers scale differently that hit point modifiers (ok!), but I'm not sure how that gets us to "it's better to scale HP than to scale AC". What criteria are we using to judge "better"? And what's the potential failure point here? What could go wrong?<br/><br/>The only one I'm aware of is the problem where one side can't hit the other at all (a la GURPS), which doesn't happen if we tend to favour increasing chances "to hit" instead of AC bonuses - at worst they just both hit each other all the time, which I'd imagine is ok (works great in Into the Odd, after all! - and the random damage still keeps things uncertain). <br/><br/>The math makes some sense here but I'm not sure where you're heading with this in the long term, in other words.                        </div>

<p>Well, heaven knows I’ve fucked up math things before so I’m not sure.</p><p>Maybe I’m just unconsciously doing the old “blast processing” schtick rn of defending 5e’s design choices no matter what.</p><p>“Better” = easier &amp; more obvious for DMs, module writers &amp; game / class / monster designers.</p><p>The skeletons chance to-hit isn’t going up right? Because you don’t want to get in the 4E situation of having to re-scale the world wherever the PCs go. “Skeletonは Skeletonだ” is still a pretty good principle.</p><p>So what you’re saying is that the PC’s chance to hit go up. Do their number of attacks go up as well?</p><p>If not…</p><p>It takes three normal weapon attacks to bring down 1 skeleton. (+5 vs AC 13, each attack deals 1d8+3.)</p><p>That decreases to two attacks to take down a skeleton once you’ve hit… wow, you need to go up to +10 to hit, (+10 vs AC 13, each attack deals 1d8+3.) And then you can’t bring it down to fewer than two normal weapon attacks per skeleton you want to dispatch as long as the weapons deal 1d8+3.</p><p>So a PC that can handle N skeletons at +5 to hit, and taking 3×[(N+1)×N/2] damage in the process,<br/>that PC can then handle N×1.5 skeletons at +10 to hit, and takes 2×[([N×1.5]+1)×[N×0.75]] damage in the process.</p><p>For all values of N, the PC takes more damage in the latter scenario.</p><p>(It starts out as the first scenario taking 80% of the damage of the latter, but then approaches 2/3 as N approaches infinity.)</p><p>Now, the argument then is obv that the PC can’t “handle” N×1.5 skeletons if she takes that much more damage. So how many more skeletons can she handle if she increases her to hit from +5 to +10 <small>(remember, any number between +5 and +9 is the same as +5 [it takes three attacks on average to fell a skellie] and any number +10 or higher is the same as +10 [it takes two attacks on average to fell a skellie])</small> while taking the same amount of damage (within 1 HP) for the whole fight on average?</p><p>Well, it starts at 1.5 for a single skeleton (uh… obv… so she can handle one skeleton as easily as one and a half skeleton, rounded down) , and approaches 1.23 as N approaches infinity.</p><p>In other words, in Skeleton World you have one very blunt knob (going from +5 to +10) and the amount of skeleton the PC can fight are these:</p><ul><li>If +5 can handle 1 skeletons, then +10 can handle 1 skeletons</li><li>If +5 can handle 2 skeletons, then +10 can handle 2 skeletons</li><li>If +5 can handle 3 skeletons, then +10 can handle 3 skeletons</li><li>If +5 can handle 4 skeletons, then +10 can handle 5 skeletons</li><li>If +5 can handle 5 skeletons, then +10 can handle 6 skeletons</li><li>If +5 can handle 6 skeletons, then +10 can handle 7 skeletons</li><li>If +5 can handle 7 skeletons, then +10 can handle 8 skeletons</li><li>If +5 can handle 8 skeletons, then +10 can handle 9 skeletons</li><li>If +5 can handle 9 skeletons, then +10 can handle 11 skeletons</li><li>If +5 can handle 10 skeletons, then +10 can handle 12 skeletons</li><li>If +5 can handle 11 skeletons, then +10 can handle 13 skeletons</li><li>If +5 can handle 12 skeletons, then +10 can handle 14 skeletons</li><li>If +5 can handle 13 skeletons, then +10 can handle 16 skeletons</li><li>If +5 can handle 14 skeletons, then +10 can handle 17 skeletons</li><li>If +5 can handle 15 skeletons, then +10 can handle 18 skeletons</li><li>If +5 can handle 16 skeletons, then +10 can handle 19 skeletons</li><li>If +5 can handle 17 skeletons, then +10 can handle 20 skeletons</li><li>If +5 can handle 18 skeletons, then +10 can handle 22 skeletons</li><li>If +5 can handle 19 skeletons, then +10 can handle 23 skeletons</li><li>If +5 can handle 20 skeletons, then +10 can handle 24 skeletons</li></ul><p>(And then it stays at just under %22.5 more skeletons as N approaches infinity.)</p> </div>

                            Our OSR campaign (over 100 sessions, four scores of casualties) has run into some trouble regarding replacements.<br/><br/>(We always start new PCs at level 1 and use a geometric XP scale, BTW.)<br/><br/>After the party reached name-level (level 6 in my homebrew) there were some bitter losses, so the players put their current quest (G2: Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl) on hold, feeling too weak to handle it (i.e. half the PCs were name-level and the other half low-level).<br/><br/>Next, they started with new characters in Dyson's Delve to level up replacements for the name-level group.<br/><br/>Then they ran into a scary monster (random restock from my own tables) practically immune to magic and put Dyson's Delve on hold to level up some fighter PCs specifically to help deal with that. <br/><br/>So right now we're following the third separate group of PCs and and recognize we have a bit of a problem...<br/><br/>Long-term, I plan on changing the rules so you have to pick a class before you roll your abilities (funny that Sarah should mention this very approach this week). This should help with party composition (and has other interesting effects I think).<br/><br/>Short-term, we plan on uniting all PCs into a giant stable - introduce them to each other, so to speak - so the name-levels might perhaps remove the roadbloack in Dyson's Delve etc. (but not get involved any further because - as Eero points out - continually risking high-level characters in adventures beneath them is a losing proposition).<br/><br/>Additionally, I think we also need to adjust expectations (and possibly the design) of high-level quests. I think it is unrealistic to expect everyone to have a name-level character at the same time. I think a mere two or three name-level characters should form the nucleus of a party for serious quests (with everyone else playing low-level extras who quickly gain a few levels if they are lucky enough to not get caught in area effects like fireball or trample attacks).                        </div>

                            Your conclusions are very similar to mine, Johann - and let me say that it's a pleasure to hear about how lethal, sandboxy and stable-y your campaign is becoming; I find these to be high virtues. I am also amazed that you're tackling the Giant series with 6th level characters [grin].<br/><br/>I am very much in favour of unevenly leveled parties, and I am also in favour of doing the exact things you're doing as a group: exploring the strategic battlespace, leveling up characters, filling up the rosters and finding the approachs that work for you. So as far as I'm concerned, anything's cool here. It would be a shame to lose track of the original high-level adventure skein you were following, but so far it seems that you have the overall picture well in hand.<br/><br/>Using a higher-level character as a battering ram to level up some weaklings is an excellent approach to leveraging a developed campaign to my mind. My religious relationship to starting at 1st level shouldn't be mistaken for some sort of desire to have the campaign remain low-level for all time; I just think that players should approach the problem holistically and solve it with the resources at their disposal rather than just give out free XP.<br/><br/>I am of the mind that generally speaking a 5th level character should be well able to seize leadership in a 1st level group and take them through some low-level dungeons. Maybe a few die on the way, but it's unlikely for the leader to die, and as long as rewarding adventures continue to be found, it'll be no time at all until those 1st-levelers are 3rd level, and then a bit after that 5th - at which point the 5th-leveler is level 6 himself, and the party is solidly mid-level. And it presumably doesn't take 20 sessions, as it seems to take us when starting from zero, thanks to the presence of the mid-level battering ram.<br/><br/>Alternatively, as you say, a firm core of mid-levelers can just take a bunch of no-level newbs into a mid-level adventure with them as redshirts. Sure, half may die on the way, but any that survive even a shorter adventure are sure to hit 2nd level even on a meager share of the spoils. They'll grow or die rather quickly even just squiring for their betters. You might consider doubling the number of entrant redshirts by having the players with name level characters run some share-eating retainer NPCs on the side; get more redshirts than just the number of players into it, and you improve the chances of even some surviving. You can then turn those heretofore-generic 2nd level retainers into player characters later as necessary.<br/><br/>Or, consider the opposite, hands-off approach: why not have the surviving high-levelers figure out some low-level questing that needs doing, and have them hire new low-level adventurers to do it? A higher-level character will presumably encounter trouble and adventure that they are motivated to address but don't want to do themselves. They can finance a lower-level party, improving its chances, and the reward money they offer is XP-worthy same as any (if NPC rewards are XP worthy, of course - some campaigns have only dungeon treasure count for that, I hear). Adult players will of course keep the financing and rewards to realistic and reasonable levels, the metagaming possibility is rather impossible to miss. Still, a juicy adventure hook with solid financing and a reward on top isn't something to ignore when you're 1st level.<br/><br/>The thing I like about this sort of campaign approach the most is the variety: instead of running through the GM's string-of-pearls, or even just managing our own rise through a sandbox, we're doing a varied tapestry of play. Getting some characters to high levels doesn't mean abandoning the low-level shenanigans, it just means adding all kinds of weird variations into the mix. It's rather obvious in my experience that a high-level adventurer will necessarily develop their own undergrowth of lower level concerns that require the players to play stuff at all levels rather than just aiming higher and higher all the time.<br/><br/>And yeah, I am with you on the possible need to rethink what high level adventures even are like. I am unwilling to commit to a stance at this time due to not having sufficient experience with high level D&amp;D, but my initial feel is that the nature of the adventures should probably change more radically than they do in the textual tradition; your average TSR high level module may not be as true and legitimate to real implications of the wargaming as I'd like. A topic for another time, preferably after we get a campaign to the lofty heights of the Giants series ourselves.                        </div>

                            A question I’d love to hear your thoughts on (aimed at everyone!):<br/><br/>What if “starting” an adventure had diegetic consequences? <br/><br/>In other words, we know what happens when you “finish” an adventure: maybe you slay the monster, clear out the dungeon, and return with wealth and magic. But what happens, in terms of consequences, when you don’t complete the adventure?<br/><br/>If you start such and such an adventure and then just leave and do something else (as in Johann’s account), should there be some consequences?<br/><br/>Have you stirred up the hornet’s nest? Awoken a sleeping evil? Started a war? Or left the unlocked tomb to be pillaged by others?<br/><br/>Would it make sense to attach meaningful consequences to the decision to “drop” an adventure?                        </div>

                            I do that all the time. The adventure starts living its own life after it's been "activated" in the campaign. This generally happens when the PCs start experiencing it, but even just blatantly ignoring a very specific adventure hook might do it: once I've established that there's a lich living thataway, it's just going to be a matter of time before the lich dungeon <i>does</i> something.<br/><br/>This is all the more true if the adventurers actually visit the adventure, even in a superficial fashion. As an example of how far this sort of thing can go, I once GMed the very first scene of the mid-level AA12, "The Barrow Mound of Gravemoor" to our group. After the party abandoned the adventure (they were clearly looking for a softer target), well, it just so happens that this particular adventure revolves around a wight with a necromantic artifact - so the wight did as a wight does, and lo and behold, later on the Italian Wars (the campaign was set in 14th century Northern Italy at that point, pretty much) had a new participant in the form of an undead army rampaging about. The original adventure design was the direct implication here: it's very clear about the goals and modus operandi of the villain, everything is going to go to hell relatively quickly of nobody delves the Barrow Mound. The PCs started seriously combating the threat at this point, which lead to a delightful campaign arc as they stole the treasury of Milan (by then thoroughly zombie-infested hellscape), fought in various pitched battles against the undead threat, had their own mercenary company contract ghoulism (subtly memetically infectious in that campaign) and so on.<br/><br/>You never know how safe it is to leave a situation be. Some other adventure locations can be perfectly static, there's nothing "going on" aside from some inconsequential dungeon ecology reshuffling as monster A eats monster B and monster C moves in from the countryside.                        </div>

For sure, I mean at the end of the day the only people I hold my self accountable to in terms of my play style are the people I actually play with. I think everyone in the campaign I've been describing here actually loved it (not that they had ever played in any other 5e campaigns before). I don't think there was really anything wrong with what I was bringing to the table but like you said so eloquently:

I got sooo tired of trying to serve that dish. I got really burnt out and eventually suggested everyone switch to Dungeon World, which actually went pretty well for everyone and was a much better fit for what we were actually doing. That game gets a lot of flack (a lot of is totally on point too), but PbtA was much better vehicle for the high fantasy tropes we were trying to hit at a lot less cost to my sanity. But I'm off topic.

It's definitely a matter of degrees, I'm not saying every goblin lair should have a beholder in it. But at the time I was saying things to myself like "I'm not going to even consider monsters over CR 2 for this portion of the <i>point crawl</i>", which I do think is boring. I also wasn't randomizing the <i>number</i> of monsters encountered. Basically I was trying to make everything seem consistent and "fair", I looked at my players and thought "they're never going to run from an encounter" (because I wouldn't let them learn that lesson) so I made sure to never put in encounters they would objectively <i>need</i> to run away from.

Yeah I actually think this is necessary <i>even</i> if you are using skill checks (not that I'm advocating for them). Most exploratory skills (lock picking, searching, etc) don't have an interesting consequence for failure unless there is some sort of time crunch. There are other ways of making time felt (rising water levels or something) but random encounters are pretty handy.

I realize they way I posed everything in that post made it seem like I'm just advocating for ramping up the CR of every encounter in my campaign until characters start dying but it's really not what I meant haha. Here's some context: I've never had a character die in <i>any</i> of my 5e games. I haven't played as much as you by a long shot, but I've played &lt; 50 sessions. In the particular campaign I've been describing I we only got down to death saving throws on two occasions.<br/><br/>I'm really not advocating for making my game "harder" (even though it's almost literally what I said), that would be just as bad as making it "fair". When I make a ruling or a judgment I try to make one that is a consistent with the fiction as possible, and whatever leeway is leftover (which is a lot whenever you are talking about fantasy) goes in favor of the players. I know that about myself and I'm not really sorry about it.<br/><br/>So what I really want is to put the adversity the characters face as much as possible under the purview of things that either:<br/>1. The players control (like their geographic location)<br/>2. The system controls (random encounter rolls with explicit and transparent triggers)

Yeah totally, and was really trying to highlight my own misconceptions here. The thing that appeals to me about B/X now is the tighter focus of play, and a clear system for facilitating it (essentially removing my own judgement where possible).<br/><br/>I'm definitely familiar with the whiff/ping factor as it comes up in Dungeon Crawl Classics all the time especially during the character funnel. I also look at some of the LL classes and think... who's gonna choose that over a 5e character??? But regardless I think B/X has a lot teach me, and it seems like an easier place to shake my old habits than starting over again with 5e. I'd rather come back to it with fresh eyes.<br/><br/>Also thank you for all your responses. I'd of course love to continue this conversation but I'm not expecting a response from you here, I'm flattered by you taking the time that you have already. Mostly I just needed to write this in order to process what you said!                        </div>

                            That's great, Eero. Exactly the sort of thing I was thinking about. <br/><br/>Although this thread made me ponder whether setting more "dangerous" stakes for a lot of adventures could be an interesting sort of incentive to "finish" a task once it's "opened". <br/><br/>It's a little artificial, in a sense, but it could be a nice frame for some of the players' decisions: the more directions they explore in, the more trouble they may have to face later.<br/><br/>I'll have to think on it some, I suppose. <br/><br/>Is that a dynamic that comes up in your campaign, whether intentionally or unintentionally?<br/><br/>It would work very organically and naturally in a "hostile environment" premised campaign, like the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20498/the-mindflayers-matrix" rel="nofollow">Mindflayer's Matrix</a> campaign frame I came up with some long time ago.                        </div>

Well, yes. I personally consider this the nature of the transformation from low-level play to mid-level play: as the adventurers uncork various adventures and their consequences (whether the players engage the adventure or leave it bubbling) start piling up, and the adventurers experience the setting in general and learn about it, an overall strategic theater of operations emerges. It's no longer just you and a dungeon; it's you and a complex set of emergent considerations all over the landscape.<br/> </div>

Hi Sandra, I'm not sure if you're aware but 17 level 1 monsters are just as dangerous to a 9th level PC in 4E as 17 CR 1 monsters are to a 9th level PC in 5E. The "Bounded Accuracy" restriction only works as a method of flattening power accumulation if all other variables are the same and they're really not: from Levels 1 to 10, the mean difficulty curve (as a metric of increased DPR output and incoming DPR mitigation) of a 4E monster is approximately 18% per +1 level whereas from CR 1 to CR 10 the mean difficulty curve of a 5E monster is approximately 25% per +1 CR. So, contrary to popular opinion and 5E marketing spin, 5E monsters actually have a steeper power curve than 4E monsters.<br/><br/>The issue is that running 65+ low-level monsters as an encounter is pretty boring and shitty no matter what system you're using. The fact the 5E monster has a 25% chance to hit while the 4E monster has a 10% chance to hit is largely irrelevant here: they're both still missing the overwhelming majority of the time and the only chance they have to take the PCs is through sheer numbers and the law of averages. 4E simply offers a more fun and reasonable alternative: re-contextualize the lower-level monster in a different category. This is really only possible because 4E monsters' XP curve matches up with the difficulty curve (whereas 5E's XP curve is almost twice its difficulty curve).<br/><br/>Also, the 4E DMG recommends using monsters up to 6 levels below and 4 levels above the player characters. That's an 11-level span here. The idea you need to "re-scale" the world every couple levels is largely bunk.<br/><br/>Trent                         </div>

This is incorrect. 4E's attack bonus curve is approximately +1 per level. 3E's attack bonus curve varies by class because of the different BAB schedules but for Fighter types (which your table is comparing) it is way, way, way more than +1 per level because it isn't factoring in feats, magic items, or ability score increases. A Fighter's actual attack bonus curve in 3E/PF is closer to +1.5 to +2 per level. 4E scaled the attack bonus curve way back  compared to 3E.

Hi Sandra, sorry I don't really have the time to do the point-by-point reply so I just wanted to address your response as a whole.<br/><br/>My overall point is not that 5e should or should not change any particular way nor do I think it particularly "improved" upon 4e in regards to monster design and encounter building rules (in some of the player-facing rules, yes there are improvements in my opinion). Rather, my point is that 4e is often misrepresented in these types of discussions. What I'm doing is correcting misinformation about what I play, not trying to tell anyone what they should or should not play. I just want to make that clear.<br/><br/>The issue with the mathematical analysis you're making is you are not taking into account the full array of numerical values that comprise a character's efficacy in combat: attack bonus, defense value, hit points, and average damage all combine to determine a creature's outgoing DPR as well as their ability to mitigate incoming DPR. You're just looking at attack bonus in a vacuum. So, yes, while a 4e monster's attack bonus goes up by +1 per level vs the 5e monster's +1/2 per CR (or, as I would put it more usefully in this discussion, a +8% increase in DPR vs a +4% increase in DPR approximately), the 4e monster's hit points only go up +8 per level vs the 5e monster's increase of +15 per CR and the 4e monster's damage only goes up by +1 per level vs the 5e monster's +3 per CR.<br/><br/>If you take the average stats of a CR1 through CR10 monster and factor in the increase in DPR output afforded by attack bonus and damage and average that with the increase in DPR mitigation afforded by AC and hit point gain, you get a mean difficulty curve of about +25% from CR n to CR n+1. If you do the same for XP values (comparing the difference between n and n+1), you will find a mean XP curve of +48% which is why I say the difficulty curve does not match up with the XP curve --- there is a reason 5e's encounter building rules are notorious for being ridiculously easy on the players.<br/><br/>If you do the same for a 4e monster and compare a level 1 through level 10 monster, you will get a mean difficulty curve of about +18% from level n to level n+1 and a mean XP curve of, shockingly, +18% from level n to level n+1. Now, the figures for both of these are of course simply statistical averages and the difficulty curve for both games is sharper at the first few levels and become progressively less sharp at higher levels.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is somewhat beside the point. In both 4e and 5e you need somewhere in the ballpark of 10 to 15 CR1/L1 monsters per 9th level PC to defeat the party. And, while yes the 5e CR1 has about a 20% better chance to hit they are still no more of a threat than a 4e L1 is because 5e expects a +24 damage difference between CR1 and CR9 whereas 4e expects a +8 damage difference between Lvl1 and Lvl9.<br/><br/>I hope I'm explaining my reasoning here well. I have a feeling I'm not communicating my points very clearly... something my math students can well attest to! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(I'll try to remember the number-E vs number-e issue in the future.)<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>

Sorry for not communicating my point better. I was addressing the point that 4e had a sharper attack bonus curve than 3e. It does not and actually scaled back 3e's curve almost as much as 5e scaled back 4e's curve.<br/><br/>A weapon attack bonus in 4e can be as high as +38 (although only a Fighter and Rogue can attain this by virtue of their class features) and an implement attack can be as high as +34. Although again, this is misleading as 4e has maximum level of 30th level. A more meaningful comparison would be to look at the attack bonus curve of each respective game which yields the +1.5x, +1x, and +0.5x values I indicated earlier.<br/><br/>Its important to note that 4e's attack bonus curve (as a measure of probability not raw numbers) is more similar to pre-WotC versions of D&amp;D as well. Both 3e and 5e are kind of the outliers here.<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>

                            OK, wait, I used the same 2 attacks per round formula that 5e uses for the 4E. Changing it to 1 attack per round would give us:

                            Hi Sandra <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> , I apologize for the curtness of my earlier posts. I read the thread over the weekend so I may not have seen the more recent posts and was trying to hammer out a response before my students came in this morning.<br/><br/>I think its important to point that I am not directly addressing *your* game but rather the 5e rules as written. I understand you have drifted pretty afar from the 5e text in many important respects. I also don't use the 4e Rules Compendium (don't own it) but the DMG1 and DMG2 as my resources (but I do own the Monster Vault and do use the updated post-MM3 monster math). In practice I would limit monsters from n-4 to n+2 in my own games, which is a solid 7-level span (well over half a tier and nearly 1/4 of the entire game's content).  <br/><br/>Yes, by difficulty I am referring to a mean of DPR output + DPR mitigation. I'm not sure where you are getting some of your numbers from. Here's how my math worked out:<br/><br/>Monsters Kill PCs: A typical 5e 9th level PC (assuming Con 14) will have approximately 19 AC and 66 hp, whereas a CR1 will have +4 to hit and deal 5 damage per round. This yields 66/(0.3 x 5) = 44 rounds to kill. By contrast, a typical 9th level 4e PC will also have 66 hp but an AC 24 vs a L1's +6 to hit and 9 damage per round. This yields 66/(0.15 x 9) = 49 rounds to kill. If we want to cap our encounter duration to 4 rounds (since nobody wants a 40+ round battle), that gives us 11 CR1s and 12 L1s per L9 PC, respectively. Keep in mind I am not factoring in the many ways monsters can get bonuses to hit in 4E (flanking and charging, for example) nor am I factoring in 4e monsters' various recharge and encounter powers (their effective damage per round is *really* 9 x 1.125 in a 4-6 round fight) which would increase their DPR even further. Near as I can tell, they're about equally dangerous offensively in both editions despite 5e's bounded accuracy.<br/><br/>PCs Kill Monsters: A typical 9th level 5e warrior type has a +9 to hit and deals 20 damage per round with both attacks (not counting special abilities or features here) vs a CR1's AC 13 and 15 hp. This yields 15/(0.85 x 20) = 0.9 rounds to kill, or approximately 1.1 dead monsters per round. By contrast, a typical 9th level 4e warrior has +15 to hit and deals 15 at-will damage per round vs a L1's 32 hp and AC 15.  This yields 32/(0.95 x 15) = 2.2 rounds to kill, or approximately 0.5 dead monsters per round. Of course, again, we're not factoring in special abilities from the PCs which may change things up (the "nova rounds" you mention before). From what I can tell, the 4e L1 has a slight edge here due to higher hp totals.<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>

I mistakenly had +10 but fixing that error only makes my case stronger, making the weenies even more of a threat than I wrote. I had messed up my ability scores for the 5e heroes throughout (the 5e heroes are consistently weaker than what I had wrote, so I erred in the direction that when fixed only strengthens my case).

                            Ahhh, you're right. I messed up my math. The CR1 should have 30 hp and 10 damage with the same attack bonus and AC. My bad. So, with that in mind....<br/><br/>Monsters Kill PC: 66/(0.3 × 10) = 22 rounds to kill, or approximately 5.5 monsters per PC for a 4-round encounter.<br/><br/>PC Kills Monsters: 30/(0.85 × 20) = 1.8 rounds to kill, or approximately 0.6 dead monsters per round.<br/><br/>I just realized another error in my analysis, however, in that a CR1 is supposed to be a challenge for four L1 PCs. This would make it equivalent to a L1 Solo in 4e, not a L1 Standard. With that in mind, the CR1/4 is structurally equivalent to a L1 Standard like you said. So, yeah. <br/><br/>What struck me during my analysis is how similar both the CR1/4 and the L1 Standard are as threats to L9 PCs in their respective games, despite the very different mathematical assumptions of those editions.<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>

That's not nearly as impressive as it sounds because we are using a heavily modified version of DCC -- let me put things into perspective:<br/><br/>(1) PCs are tougher than in OD&amp;D: bigger hit dice, 4d6-drop-lowest (though no ability score increases), roll twice for hp at 1st level. Not exactly pure OSR...<br/><br/>(2) DCC classes have a lot more firepower than OD&amp;D's. High-level fighters, for instance, score critical hits more often, use brutal critical hit tables, and can easily perform "mighty deeds" (i.e. hamstring, blind etc.).<br/><br/>(3) PCs can spend Luck (refilled upon gaining a new level), which is very handy for those situations when you absolutely need to land that hit (low levels) or make a save (name-level only).<br/><br/>Monsters also receive plenty of buffs when I convert them, but PCs clearly have the edge. I'd say the PCs effectively punch at a level roughly x1.5 or x2 their own compared to AD&amp;D.<br/><br/>Also, I typically double all treasure across the board. Combined with delving deeper earlier due to their firepower, the PCs level up very quickly. I'd estimate 2 sessions per current level to reach the next one (e.g. 2 sessions to get from 1st to 2nd). That's a tenth of the time you guys need... The PCs completed Barrowmaze I in about 50 sessions, making level 6 at the very end.<br/><br/>(Redshirt PCs in high-level parties level up even faster, though casualty rates are high and XP tend to be more chunky in higher level endeavours.)<br/><br/>I guess that makes me a bit of a Monty Haul DM, albeit a bloodthirsty one (i.e. all the fabulous prizes are covered in the viscera of the unlucky contestants).

That's a very heartening appraisal because I was starting to get worried.

That's exactly what the third group is doing right now. They are exploring the excellent "Fever Swamp" hexcrawl led by a 4th level PC fighter. She regularly steps forward from the front rank to draw attacks and only then the low-level PCs swarm forward... <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/><br/><br/>Moreover, low-level PCs receive excellent starting equipment, e.g. plate armor and a magic weapon in the name-level party (still the property of the order they have founded).
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>What if “starting” an adventure had diegetic consequences? </p></div></blockquote>
We do that all the time, but there have been only modest consequences so far. Once the party had cleared out the upper levels of Dyson's Delve, for instance, I established a routine to have the manticores lower down move up every couple of months. The PCs took some detours, so the manticores eventually emerged from the dungeon and attacked the nearby village.<br/><br/>As for the "Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl", the party has not really 'activated' the adventure. Having established their own stronghold in "The Steading of the Hill Giant Chief" (and having defended it against a frost giant war party in our first military engagement) they are currently on a diplomatic mission to amazon tribes in the North to get intel on the frost giants.<br/><br/>The second party, established to create replacements via Dyson's Delve, was deliberately put in limbo regarding the campaign calendar, so as to make uniting it with the first party later easier. It doesn't feel quite right, but seeing how that second endeavour has snowballed to create new adventures, alliances and such, I'm at a loss regarding how to handle this. (Probably just bite the bullet and unite the parties and calendars and take it from there with some downtime / what-happens-at-your-stronghold-this-year tables.)<br/><br/>(It's also problematic that the NPC lord who called for adventurers to pacify Dyson's Delve is a rival/neighbor to the name-level PCs. If they come to blows with each other we'll run into continuity errors.)                        </div>

                            Trent: But even when talking about CR 1/4 you would've had the party dead in six rounds. <br/><br/>You can't just do [MkP_rounds / PkM_rounds] even for one PC vs one monster. That's where you're going wrong, mathwise. (Threadjacking this thread to talk about 4E just because I thought a level 30 could get +37 is another issue entirely.)<br/><br/>You'd have to solve for X where<br/>MkP_rounds &gt; (PkM_rounds ×[(X+1)×X/2])<br/><br/>You know vs AC 19 that the skellies deal 1.5 damage per round so in your example, the lone MkP_Rounds 22 PC would be dead vs 7 skellies.<br/><br/>Your mistake seems to be that you think that each PC is only attacked by a single monster each round. That the monsters line up and queue for death. But the PC is attacked by multiple monsters.<br/><br/>And then for multiple PCs it gets more complicated, it's not just 7×PCs.<br/><br/>As I showed <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/482234/#Comment_482234" rel="nofollow">back in this post. It's MkP_rounds</a><br/><br/>Don't worry, Jeph, this is for 5th, at least my last two posts were and the six round detailed example were. And so is this one <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/><br/>Even though it applies to all D&amp;D games.<br/> </div>

Hot damn, you totally should use the 0th level character conceit here, then! That is, let the players start with four 0th level characters instead of a single 1st level character if they want to. (They would have to stable the extra ones when they hit 1st level, but as long as they're 0th you'd allow playing multiple PCs per player.) That's such an off-the-wall idea when applied to a sandbox that it'd be hilarious to see what happens. The DCC rules totally presume a string-of-pearls campaign structure (basically legit, but not as legit as sandbox, if you ask me) with the character funnel being used only for the campaign start, but that's such an excellent way of populating a character stable quickly... why not have four times the number of red-shirts to start with!<br/><br/>Just imagine the crew: e.g. three players playing four henchmen each, plus a few higher-level characters with say two retainers per head, plus whatever armsmen the party might have attracted... that's basically at my ideal low-level party size - the size of a football team and a half, that is.<br/><br/>Your campaign does sound a bit generous with the treasure, but that doesn't equal Monty Haul, philosophically speaking. A topic for another time no doubt, but let me say that while I dislike Monty Haul (the practice of artificial power pumping), I don't particularly mind the fact that some campaigns are more generous on advancement than others. My own seems to run at a hilariously high degree of difficulty, but I don't consider that to be some sort of ultimate virtue - playing more generously is fine, too, as long as it's not stupidly trivial Monty Haul generosity. Either way, I'd never be so crass as to critique another campaign's practices from the armchair - you'll need to invite me to play if you want me to judge your game like that [grin].                        </div>

                            Hi Sandra, I think you misunderstand me. I'm using the DPR calculations for the purpose of comparing the monsters' relative threat level across the two editions (which, from what I can tell, are pretty damn near the same despite 5E marketing suggesting otherwise). I don't actually suggest the numbers I've offered would make for good encounters or anything like that. It was just a cursory analysis of DPR input and output.<br/><br/>For one thing, "in the wild" L9 4e PCs have 3 encounter powers, 2 daily powers, 2 utility powers, and (a little over half the time) an action point at their disposal. 5e characters likewise have varying degrees of special powers and class features. A few well-placed area attacks would make short work out of our CR1/4 and L1 hordes. In actual practice, they're actually *less* threatening than the numbers are making them out to be (unless the party is totally bereft of AoEs or something like that).<br/><br/>Trent                        </div>

I'm soooo curious about this. I happen to like DCC a lot, and I'm a big fan of some of it's modules too. That said I've noticed that most of the modules have a sort of "the adventurers show up just as the cultists start hurling victims into the sacrifice pit" quality to them. Even the rooms tend to be laid out in a way that funnels the players in a particular direction. So I definitely see what you mean about assuming a string-of-pearls structure, the modules are definitely a clear window into that.<br/><br/>I guess what I wanted to know is do you see things about the core rules that would get in the way of sandbox play? From what I remember it's kind of lacking in rules for wilderness travel (I may just not have seen them, since we were just running individual modules). But is it more than what's lacking though, is it also the stuff that's added like the emphasis on otherworldly patrons and such?<br/><br/>Here I go again with completely off topic questions.                        </div>

I was thinking this, as well. I actually ran across almost exactly this situation in the 5E campaign I played: five PCs (levels 5-7) against 20 or so low-level monsters (zombies or skeletons).<br/><br/>Because it was a random encounter and we started at a fair distance from each other, the “bad guys” were all dead before their initiative even came up! All slaughtered.<br/><br/>A similar encounter happened later with a band of goblins. (Maybe 15-20 of them.) They got in a lot more attacks, and the “soft targets” had to carefully keep their distance, but otherwise it was a very easy fight, with little real danger.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> - I’d like to hear your thoughts on DCC and adventure structure, as well.                        </div>

                            I have only read some minor DCC adventures, actually - most of what I know of the game is from reading the core rulebook and some supplementary material (e.g. the considerately put-together Lankhmar book they recently put out). If you tell me that the adventures are sort of middle schoolish, I believe that; the books I've read are very old school in <i>aesthetics</i>, but it's not particularly challenge-oriented, GM-hygienic or wargamey.<br/><br/>It's actually an excellent example of what I mean when I say that "old school" is not a creative agenda, but rather an aesthetic; DCC is totally old school, but it's not really written for the specific kind of futile and twisted D&amp;D that I like to play myself. Very similar to <i>Mazes and Minotaurs</i> in that I like the aesthetics in both, and they're close enough for government work, but I always get the distinct feeling while reading that these people are softcore; they don't <i>really</i> embrace hygienic practice, playing for failure and player responsibility for their own success in the way e.g. LotFP does, to pick an example of the other flavour of old school.<br/><br/>(I will emphasize here: there is nothing wrong with being softcore in this sense. The only thing that might be remotely wrong is when you're not honest about what you're doing, which is admittedly a problem at times when people pretend to being more hardcore than they actually are. The world is full of human imperfection though, and that's no more special than any other sort. It's not like I'm any more sane myself, my imperfection just takes different forms.)<br/><br/>That being said, it is also the case that there is nothing whatsoever in the DCC rules that I remember as a particularly serious hurdle for using it as the mechanical basis for the hardcore challenge-oriented adventuring D&amp;D that I so adore. It's basically similar to other new old school rules texts: a bunch of mechanizations for common D&amp;D situations, with relatively little systemic text or technical framing for what the GM should do with it. I wouldn't mind running it myself any more than I would mind other good old school rules sets. It's perhaps a bit mechanically intensive, and thus not the nimblest of tools, but there are far worse out there. AD&amp;D by the book, for example.<br/><br/>Well, thinking of it, I would actually take a good hard look at the way the Luck statistic works in the game. It's relatively quirky for D&amp;D work, particularly in the way it is refreshed. But that's the sort of minor consideration you need here, nothing out of the ordinary. The core is just D&amp;D, same ol', same ol'.                        </div>

In my opinion, DCC-as-written is <b>not suitable for sandbox play at all</b>.<br/><br/>Magic is vastly overpowered -- there are tons of threads about this at the Goodman Games forums - but the real problem is spellburn, i.e. the option to temporarily sacrifice ability points to get a bonus to spellcasting.<br/><br/>DCC's spell tables feature extreme maximum results at the top, such as the <i>sleep</i> spell putting to sleep the entire dungeon! This is absolutely awesome and why I chose DCC for our OSR sandbox campaign, a first for us: It makes the campaign railroad-proof because magic is so unpredictably powerful.<br/><br/>The problem is that spellburn allows PCs to 'buy' these results at will. Burn ten points of Strength, Dexterity and Personality each, and you're basically there. Abysmal ability scores (except for Intelligence and Luck) are not much of a problem for a spellcaster (your melee prowess sucked to begin with, and a low AC/Reflex save etc. are ugly, but you are in the second rank anyway).<br/><br/>It takes thirty days to recover from this <b>but if the players set the pace of the campaign (as they do in a sandbox campaign), this drawback is a non-issure</b>. Nuke the dungeon (unroof it with <i>enlarge</i>, put everyone to <i>sleep</i>, <i>summon animal</i>s like a bunch of grizzlies to clear out the monsters - this is how my group cleared the first two levels of Dyson's Delve in an evening - or whatever), go home with the treasure, wait for the magic-user to recover.<br/><br/>In my opinion, only heavy-handed DMing can make magic-users pay the price by forcing the PCs into adventures against their will, either after a big spellburn or by using the convention-style set-ups of many DCC modules ("you have until sunrise before the mysterious tower disappears again").<br/><br/>(I admit that I have not tried using DCC-as-written, but I have analysed and houseruled the heck out of it and am convinced it's not what I would want for a sandbox.)                        </div>

                            Thanks for the DCC report, Johann - that's top self content, highly interesting. In fact, we should set you up with a new thread so you could tell us more.<br/><br/>All of what you say makes sense, by the way. I can see those rules doing those sorts of things. It's nothing you can't fix at the table, of course, provided you believe in the group taking responsibility for their own mechanics.

                            I'd personally think that it would be good to start the new character a level higher. There was clearly a fuckup on either the part of the GM or the player. The GM either didn't handle things well and the character died because of it when they shouldn't have,  in which case the extra level would be an apology from the GM to the player, or the player failed to strategize properly, in which case giving them the extra level would help them out. Like the (honestly really cool) trend in modern video game design of making it a little easier when the player dies, through either lower the difficulty, giving them buffs when they load back in, etc. <br/>It's possible that might not be appropriate for the sort of stuff you're doing, but I don't really have a frame of reference for OSR design other than comparing it to video game design but without direct continues (although I feel a challenge-based rpg embracing continues could also be really cool).                        </div>

                            I get that! It's something I personally really value as a disabled person, in large part because it mitigates sections that cause me sensory overload and anxiety and the like, which is a fairly common experience for me in video games because of how much modern games focus on flashy particle effects and high-speed sections with extremely low margin of error. <br/>Ideally though, to balance things out, I like when games increase the difficulty when you're doing well so that then if there's a segment you're having trouble with and dying a lot, you can rebuild your difficulty after finishing it, and if you're doing well throughout, it'll keep making it even harder.                        </div>

                            I agree with Guy, that's how I react to that conceit in video games, too. I never get the chance to fail and learn to do it properly if the game adjusts itself to prevent me from failing. I will in fact just start restarting the game to avoid the "black mark" if it's not avoidable otherwise.<br/><br/>I actively grow distressed by a video game when I realize that I have ended up in a feed drip without any purpose outside retaining my attention as long as possible. I'm not an animal, I don't want to be managed by a computer software.<br/><br/>It's probably no surprise that this transfers to tabletop games, too. I want to be going somewhere as a human person, which makes me suspicious of any game where the conceit is sheer entertainment. If I wanted to be entertained I'd do drugs.<br/><br/>The above seems worded stridently - I blame the late hour - but it's all just an expression of personal preference.                        </div>

                            Yeah, that's fair. I have the tendency to forget that those features aren't universally treated as good and important like they are in most circles I'm in. <br/>It's not about the game holding your hand or IV dripping you.

                            I like the notion of a "adaptive difficulty" (or whatever it's actually called) - it seems like good design, when that's the game's goal. I would play such a game, even knowing that I was being robbed of actually developing skill, overcoming challenge, and all the other good things.<br/><br/>When the purpose of a game is to entertain a single player for a long period of time, that sounds like a great idea. However, I don't really see a good way of doing that in a group endeavour, like a D&amp;D game. Unless the game's goals are always perfectly aligned and synchronized for every character/player (so that group success and individual success are always one and the same), it doesn't sound like something that's feasible by humans in real time (and would have strange consequences if it did).<br/><br/>We do see such mechanics in some RPGs, though, like Lady Blackbird's "pool dice" (which you lose when you succeed, but not when you fail), and any game which rewards your character for failing (e.g. Dungeon World's "mark experience on a miss").                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> <a href="/forums/profile/Johann">@Johann</a> I really appreciate you sharing your impressions/experiences with DCC and how it applies to the style of game we have been talking about.<br/><br/>I think it's kind of interesting how D&amp;D as a system can change within a group of players. Rules get added and removed to taste until you find something that works. 
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Johann" rel="nofollow">Johann</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I don't want to bash DCC, by the way.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>It's chockful of great ideas and great art, but I think it has problems very similar to AD&amp;D (needlessly clunky etc.) as well as balance issues (though that is a loaded term and a discussion for another day).</p></div></blockquote>
I don't see you bashing it, it sounds like you found out it has problems long term for the experience you are looking for. Just out of curiosity how long did you play with it before you reached those conclusions, like approximately in terms of sessions?<br/><br/>I have this pet theory (it's probably not new), that simpler systems become more appealing over time. When you first start playing more is better, you want a lot of props like sweet crit tables and spells that summon way too many grizzlies or whatever.<br/><br/>Imagine these games are like a hot fudge sundae cherries and chocolate sauce all over it. By the time you are eating your 50th sundae you realize you can't taste the ice cream underneath at all so you switch to plain vanilla, and find out there are all these subtle tastes to it depending on where the vanilla was grown or the exact salt content of the ice cream. You eat that for a while and the hot fudge sundae looks like some awful ploy to sell you bad ice cream (and it might be).<br/><br/>Ok this metaphor is maybe not that useful, but I think what I'm trying to say is there is a context to play that haven't seen talked about (though I'm sure it has been), which is "how much are you doing it." It's funny I've never played B/X as is pretty clear from this thread. But I've always thought it would be cool to do the opposite, something like X/B. A system that has a bunch of fun toys at the beginning and then becomes more system/challenge focused at the end.<br/><br/>I think about this a lot because I've played more D&amp;D than anyone else that I know in my personal life, and I still feel like I'm just getting the hang of it. I introduce new people to the game <i>a lot</i>, and I think DCC modules are great for this because they're relatively consistent in terms of the experiences they produce (<i>consistent can also be read "boring"</i>), which is great if you're not sure if this might be the only game of D&amp;D the person ever plays.<br/><br/>Anyway I'm pretty sure this isn't a new idea to anyone here but I thought I'd bring it up anyway.                        </div>

I really like these features too! But I'm just bad at a lot of games, even when I practice a lot I get better but I still feel like I'm way to far behind.<br/><br/>There's a game I like called <i>Hollow Knight</i> that is a platformer with really beautiful art and music. There was something cool about struggling to make it to the next area and the reward of seeing the new sprites when I got there. But at the same time I never made it to the end of the game because of time and my skill level so there's a bunch of stuff I'll never get to see which is kind of sad.<br/><br/>I think when people make these kind of interactive art experiences they imagine everyone else will experience them basically the same way they do. I'm putting words in other peoples mouths but I think in their eyes alternate modes would be a pollution of the experience as they intended it. But maybe without realizing that people won't actually have that experience if they _don't_ allow people to make adjustments.<br/><br/>I actually realize I'm talking about something different now, not a game that adapts to you, but one you can adjust yourself like a helmet strap.                        </div>
