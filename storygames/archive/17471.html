I found that interesting because it implies that Egri's ideas are some how definitive to the idea of Story Now. I really don't find them to be. Egri's ideas were certainly important to Ron when he wrote those old GNS essays, but since then things have moved on, I don't think Egri has been part of the discussion since, uh... I'd say 5-6 years.<br/><br/>I still think the idea of Premise--a moral/dramatic question that is answered by the fiction--is a real thing, but at this point I recognize Premise as an emergent property of Story Now, not something that is necessarily planned for. In other words, Premise is something that largely becomes apparent upon reflection of the fiction, going into play (and even sometimes during play) you don't really know what the true Premise will be.<br/><br/>At this point I would define Story Now something like this:\n<blockquote><i>Story Now</i> is play in which the purpose and focus--consciously or subconsciously--is the expression of some sort of emotion, idea, and/or theme through the medium of improvisational storytelling.</blockquote>\nThere are three important bits here:<br/><br/><b>1) It's improvisational</b><br/>This is the "now" part of Story Now. There's some leeway in how you define improvisation, but the idea is that you create the fiction as you go along.<br/><br/><b>2) It's about "expressing" or otherwise communicating some sort of emotion, idea, or theme</b><br/>Story Now is inherently artistic. This is why the idea of Premise or theme comes up, because the participant--either consciously or subconsciously--is expressing and communicating something inside themselves (like all artists do) through the decisions they make in play.<br/><br/><b>3) This "expression" is the purpose and focus of play</b><br/>In my mind this is the most difficult part to discuss, because theme can emerge as a byproduct of play those priorities lie elsewhere. But Story Now requires that all of participants--again, consciously or subconsciously--are <i>actively</i> involved in the creation of this "expression".<br/><br/><b>Please note</b>: While Story Now is inherently about storytelling, I make no attempt to define "story". I don't believe that's actually necessary, I'm perfectly fine with people using their own definitions and structures of "story".                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395703/#Comment_395703" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T10:15:52+00:00" title="November  1, 2012 10:15AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 1, 2012 10:22AM by Todd_L.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Egri's ideas aren't specific to Egri.  I perpetually recommend David Mamet's 'On Directing Film' which offers the same theory of theme/premise as Egri.   And Mamet's book explicitly traces its ideas back to Aristotle's 'Poetics'.  There's a vast body of scholarship based on Aristotle.<br/>So... to divorce Story Now from Egri is to divorce rpg theory from kindred areas of culture, such as literature and theatre.<br/>I think there's a case to be made For such a divorce, and a case to be made Against it.<br/><br/>Pro-Divorce: If you want to emphasize the ways that rpgs are unique from similar forms, and develop that uniqueness, rather than copycat literature and theatre.<br/><br/>Anti-Divorce: if you want to benefit from the centuries of wisdom developed in other forms of storytelling, keep rpg discussion intelligible to people schooled in those other areas, and make games which emphasize the best aspects of those other areas.<br/><br/>I am in the anti-divorce camp.  For the last handful of years, I see Vincent Baker as tending toward the pro-divorce camp... to name just one example.  The pro-divorce camp seems predominant to me, but maybe that's just because I'm so firmly on the other side.<br/><br/>Story Now was formerly in the Egri camp, and I don't think it's possible to divorce it from that, without Story Now evolving into a different thing... which would (confusingly) maintain the same name.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395712/#Comment_395712" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T11:07:21+00:00" title="November  1, 2012 11:07AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When it comes to Story Now and Egri, I'm anti-divorce.

Story Now is a creative agenda, which means players must be purposefully, actively, and emotionally engaged toward addressing premise. The only place any of this matters is at the player level, what they're focused upon and what excites them about play.<br/><br/>Same goes with Sim/Right to Dream. If I'm there to create as closely as possible my vision of a vampire romance, and getting that right, from the fine details to overall structure, is my primary concern, then that's the agenda I'm concerned about.<br/><br/>I think it's safe to say that most of us are juggling multiple concerns in play, but something has to give and a priority come to the forefront.

The recognition that what one participant wants from play may be incompatible with that of another participant, and the ways in which a coherent design or larger scale social contract stuff can ameliorate or solve those issues.<br/><br/>If I called the categories "Put Out the Fire", "Watch the Football Game", and "Feed the Children", it's pretty easy to see how one might prioritize those and how there could be conflict between people with a different prioritization. Assume that "Put Out the Fire" is always the name of an individual's preferred agenda and it's not hard to see why so much unhappiness can occur during play.<br/><br/>So yeah, I think people will always disagree about the creative agenda categories and what they cover, but the overall structure of The Big Model is pretty sound from my perspective.<br/><br/>Also, I apologize Tim if this is getting too far afield from what you wanted to discuss.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395758/#Comment_395758" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-01T15:14:33+00:00" title="November  1, 2012  3:14PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm interested in the same issue Jason is.

Call of Cthulhu and Star Trek are usually cited as examples here, as those are often topics on which people <i>want</i> to play simulationistic, without deconstructing the source material, but rather celebrating it.<br/><br/>Perhaps Tim's formulation could be made more exact by clarifying that the "artistic expression" in term 2) needs to be a socially genuine statement among the play-group: it is not sufficient for players to be aping a script, but rather their expression needs to be substantially original.

He draws back the hammer. 'You ready to receive your sentence?!?' he says, voice quavering."  Brown's screwed-up beliefs has him ready to gun down his own brother, and it's tearing him to pieces, but I, JDC, feel nothing but delight and satisfaction for the shit situation this guy has gotten himself into with his own tragically misguided beliefs. <br/><br/>Under the essay-and-after definitions, this could be considered an instance of Narrativist play - I, the player, am making a moral statement about Brown's beliefs that have pushed him into this intolerable situation.  Maybe I've expressed him as too fundamentalist, or too forgiving, or too whatever, but some moral flaw has led him here and I, JDC, am expressing my judgment about this through my play of Dogs and through the system of Dogs.  I am saying "this is how people who have Brown's moral code work under these pressures...how sick is that!" Yet I am not upset (as Brown is), actually I am absolutely thrilled at how screwed up the situation is and the more horrible problems Brown's beliefs causes him, the more excited I am to play.  <br/><br/>(I think this is a pretty standard way to play Dogs in the Vineyard, by the by...at least I've seen others do it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>By your definition, this would not be Narrativism, because I feel nothing of what the character does and do not put my own immediate feelings into the character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395929/#Comment_395929" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T13:52:33+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  1:52PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason makes good points, certainly. That's narrativist play he's describing, it seems to me; he's taking artistic responsibility, he's making brother Brown act in the way that seems true to life to him and to hell with genre expectations. I also don't see much credence in the idea that the player's personal emotional life would necessarily be reflected in narrativist play; I've had that sort of play, but most of the times I do solid, basic narrativism it is no more personal than any other creative agenda.<br/><br/>Perhaps if I had to explain narrativism without Egri I would focus on how the players view artistic responsibility at the table. If your play is <i>performance</i> that you need to get right, then that seems like simulationism, while if your play is a <i>statement</i> you have a right to as an empowered participant, then it's narrativism. Note that I don't care whether your performance or statement has a solid basis on e.g. genre here - you can do very genre-faithful play that is still narrativist as long as your relationship to this background expectation is narrativist in nature. Thus e.g. <i>Dust Devils</i> remains narrativist even as players will usually reference genre all the time; the taste of their play is that they discuss genre and relate to it, not that they instantiate it faithfully.<br/><br/>Fortunately I personally have no need to get rid of the Premise and other internal constructions of the standard theory of how narrativism works, as it seems to be a bit tricky to come up with useful and true alternative formulations. Still, it's useful to work on this sort of thing, as it might produce an alternative internal model; if it did, that in turn would enable new ideas for game design.

To my ears, the DitV example seems perfectly in line with what I've been saying all along in this thread. What is "making a moral statement" (in the context of an RPG) other than making an artistic statement, which is the same as expressing an artistic impulse (an emotion, idea, and/or theme)?<br/><br/>I chose expressing an emotion for my "cheesy and simplistic" example because I thought expressing emotion would more easily illustrate the distinction between expressing an original statement and acting out a thematic genre trope. Is that the point of miscommunication? I never said Story Now is <i>*always*</i> about expressing one's current emotional state (though that does happen, on occasion).<br/><br/>I also continue to agree with Eero's articulation concerning artistic responsibility and Story Now. <i>(I have always been impressed by Eero's ability to articulate difficult topics like this.)</i><br/><br/>PS--I should say that distinguishing between authentic Narrativism and "thematic simulation" has always been a difficult topic to discuss, going all the way back to when the essays were written. So it's no surprise that it's causing issues here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395959/#Comment_395959" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T17:39:19+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  5:39PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What is "making a moral statement" (in the context of an RPG) other than making an artistic statement, which is the same as expressing an artistic impulse (an emotion, idea, and/or theme)?<br/></blockquote>\nBecause you can express an emotion or an artistic impulse without it being particularly morally based or related to a moral premise.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395965/#Comment_395965" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T18:45:36+00:00" title="November  2, 2012  6:45PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So is this going to keep happening now that the forge is dead, or...?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395977/#Comment_395977" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-02T22:01:29+00:00" title="November  2, 2012 10:01PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whose idea was it to start unearthing old discussion topics, anyway? The only solace I can offer to the easily annoyed is that you don't have to participate in the pointless discussions. That's what I do.<br/><br/>About moral vs. artistic, Jason: you've expressed your dislike of the "moral" thing in the past, and it seems to me that this might just derive from a somewhat narrow reading of what is intended with the word. When I myself use narrativist theory, that "moral premise" thing gets to stand in for quite a wide range of thematic potentials. I don't feel the term entirely far-fetched myself because it does draw attention to how socially pertinent the premise and theme necessarily are, even when they go past ethics into other matters of life. Ultimately theme is about philosophical communication and characterizing it as "morally based" is just a particularly tight-assed way of describing this. "Morality" is often used in ethics to distinguish discussion of human behavior from discussion of goodness proper (ethical good vs. moral good), which I understand is the sense when Egri claims that literary theme arises from a moral premise.<br/><br/>This is of course not to say that literary theme is the entirety of artistic expression. There <i>are</i> artistic (and aesthetic) qualities that fall beyond the scope of narrativism; Ron seems to think that these are non-dramatic artistic expressions, and I agree with the idea to a large degree. For example, poetry does not necessarily get structured out of a moral premise because poetry does not have to involve storytelling or drama in the Egrian sense; it's literature and art without being story.<br/><br/>This comes back to the idea that you can have artistic impulses without them being particularly moral in nature. I agree insofar as there are arts that are not about constructing compelling stories, but I also think that these types of artistic impulses simply don't pertain to narrativism directly. You can express an artistic impulse for beautiful expression alongside any creative agenda, for example, and we regularly do. I've had some moments of rather beautiful narration in our fully gamist D&amp;D campaign, for example.<br/><br/>Perhaps we could attempt to develop some example of story creation as a creative act that didn't have a moral core (in the wide sense), but all the examples of such that I can think of are of a nature where I'm quite comfortable dismissing it as a non-dramatic story or a creative act that has other virtues aside from plot (which is basically the thing narrativism is concerned with - how to have an emotionally compelling plot).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GregPogor" title="GregPogor"><img alt="GregPogor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_e5387V2_bKU/TVEgYJ8ZWtI/AAAAAAAAAcw/CFb4Akfg5SE/avatar_storygame_small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GregPogor">GregPogor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396031/#Comment_396031" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T06:33:16+00:00" title="November  3, 2012  6:33AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does, in this disussion, "making a moral statement" means anything more than "I have no choice but act and there's no perfect answer"?<br/><br/>My brother is a sinner, my role is to root out sin, I can't do nothing.

That strikes me as extremely odd. I'm neither Ron nor Egri, and I won't attempt to put words in their mouths, but I suspect you're reading the concept of "premise" exceedingly narrowly.<br/>As for <i>Dirty Secrets</i> specifically, I never felt that the point of the game was in producing genre fiction (in the emulative sense), but rather in situating noir-like fiction close to the players' everyday setting, in such a way that play comments on the realities of contemporary society and the causes and consequences of crime. The value of "noir" here is not in the mystery as such, as much as in the human interactions involved: why do people commit murder or other crimes? How does it change them? How does it impact the victims, as well as other people in their community? How much does it cost to learn the truth, and how deep are you willing to go? Elements such as race, social class, law-enforcement authority etc. are also involved, with related prejudices and issues. There's lots of potential Premises there, and even more potential answers (moral, subjective). The reference to genre fiction is that "hard-boiled" detective story can provide a window into that; while <i>Dirty Secrets</i> play consists of talking about all that, through the fictional lens provided by a character who's investigating a mystery.\n<blockquote>Also, I think this definition would encompass DMs designing and running a homebrewed campaign of D&amp;D (though potentially not the play of the other players.) Right?</blockquote>\nWrong. Because of a technical/definitional reason: it's only defined as a Creative Agenda if it's the shared priority of <i>everybody</i> playing (in case their priorities are unaligned, then there's no Creative Agenda there, by the Edwardsian definition).<br/>Though, of course, you <i>can</i> have a Story Now CA in your D&amp;D game (campaign) \u2014 consciously or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396063/#Comment_396063" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T10:55:10+00:00" title="November  3, 2012 10:55AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2012 11:26AM by JDCorley.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I absolutely agree some Dirty Secrets play could be classified as what-the-essays-call Narrativist, but certainly not all of it.

Right?</blockquote>\nI'm fine calling a GM's campaign material an authentic artistic expression (given that it meets the prerequiste definition of "artistic", yadda yadda), but that doesn't necessarily make it Story Now.<br/><br/>- If the campaign plot is all prepped ahead of time, and the GM is essentially just running through their script, then that play fails on the improvisational front.<br/><br/>- If the GM is artistically engaged in improvisational storytelling, but the rest of group is only engaged in a tactical or simulationist sense, then that play would be classified as incoherent, since the group is divided on their purpose and focus.<br/>_________<br/><br/>Nowadays I don't really adhere to the Big Model in my own thinking (and some of that might be showing through in this discussion), but I'm not trying to push that here. I really believe that what I'm saying here is in line with the original essays... Or rather, I think I'm peering through the original Narrativism essay and uncovering what the essay was pointing towards.<br/><br/>Here's the section of the essay where Ron defines Story Now:<blockquote>Story Now requires that at least one engaging issue or problematic feature of human existence be <i>addressed</i> in the process of role-playing.  "Address" means:<br/>- Establishing the issue's Explorative expressions in the game-world, "fixing" them into imaginary place.<br/><br/>- Developing the issue as a source of continued conflict, perhaps changing any number of things about it, such as which side is being taken by a given character, or providing more depth to why the antagonistic side of the issue exists at all.<br/><br/>- Resolving the issue through the decisions of the players of the protagonists, as well as various features and constraints of the circumstances.</blockquote>\nCan it really be that easy? Yes, Narrativism is that easy. The <i>Now</i> refers to the people, during actual play, focusing their imagination to create those emotional moments of decision-making and action, and paying attention to one another as they do it. To do that, they relate to "the story" very much as authors do for novels, as playwrights do for plays, and screenwriters do for film at the creative moment or moments. Think of the Now as meaning, "in the moment," or "engaged in doing it," in terms of input and emotional feedback among one another. The Now also means "get to it," in which "it" refers to any Explorative element or combination of elements that increases the enjoyment of that issue I'm talking about.<br/><br/>There cannot be any "<i>the</i> story" during Narrativist play, because to have such a thing (fixed plot or pre-agreed theme) is to remove the whole point: the creative moments of addressing the issue(s). Story Now has a great deal in common with Step On Up, particularly in the social expectation to contribute, but in this case the real people's attention is directed toward one another's insights toward the issue, rather than toward strategy and guts. <br/>Now, Ron does specifically discuss expressing one's artistic impulse (ie, "engaging issue") through conflict. I do think that confuses "what" we do with "how" we accomplish it (as I implied earlier in the discussion). So in that regard I might be broadening the definition a little, but I believe people's understanding of Story Now has already been broadened over the intervening years, so I don't believe I'm rocking the boat right now.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396487/#Comment_396487" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-05T18:08:53+00:00" title="November  5, 2012  6:08PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Drifted Narrativism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
