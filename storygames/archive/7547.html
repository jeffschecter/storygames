I won't let you down.  And I won't let you fall, if the moment ever comes."</i>  One who has seen far too many pilots die on her screams for "Bring Me To Life" by Evanescence: and there's not an anchor in the world who wouldn't relate to Polly Scattergood's "I Hate The Way."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
