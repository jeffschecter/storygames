I am happy to say that an improved version is now available. Problems with the layout have been fixed, more artwork has been added, and some very minor changes have been made to the text (mostly to fix typos and to accommodate the new layout). <br/><br/><a href="http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/thehouselesshills" rel="nofollow">Get it here!</a><br/><br/>If you are happy with the old version and you don't want the new one, that's fine. The rules have not changed and you will still be playing the same game whichever one you use.<br/><br/>For those of you not familiar with Bleake Rebellion, you can read about it by below:<br/><br/><i>Bleake Rebellion is a captivating fantasy roleplaying game where you create a band of rebels seeking to overthrow the corrupt authorities that rule their beloved city. With its unique system for resolving challenges and building stories, Bleake Rebellion is the must have game for anyone who wants a fair, even-handed and emotionally fulfilling roleplaying experience. This book contains essential rules to get you started on your first story, advanced rules for when you have become an expert and a guide to life in the rebels' city. For 3 to 6 players aged 16 or older.<br/><br/>Bleake Rebellion is a low to medium crunch narrative game. When a player's rebel tries to overcome an obstacle, the other players vote on whether they think that rebels success or failure is good for the story. To make their vote a player adds coloured beads to a bag and then the player who is roleplaying the rebel facing the challenge blindly draws some beads. The combination of beads he draws determines what happens next. It could be success or failure, and it could lead to a positive or negative outcome.<br/> <br/>Set in a pseudo-historical 18th century European city where some of the people are turned into magic wielding miscreations by an eldritch pollution called the miasma, the faithful can bring about miracles, and places of intense suffering become cursed, Bleake Rebellion explores the darkness within the hearts of rebels as they try to overthrown the tyrannical regime that rules their city.<br/><br/>No of Players: 3 to 6<br/>Time to Play: 3 to 6 sessions<br/>Genre: Low Fantasy</i><br/><br/>In addition to the improved layout, I have chosen to extend the 30% discount for the printed book to the end of this year. The original plan was to keep the discount until the new layout was ready, but with Christmas just around the corner, it feels right to keep it going a bit longer.<br/><br/>Finally, if you have purchased a copy of Bleake Rebellion and want the updated version, send an e-mail to thehouselesshills[at]gmail.com and I will make sure you get a free PDF copy of the new version. Just remember to include a copy of the receipt/order form as proof of purchase. <br/><br/>Kind Regards,<br/><br/>M. J.
