Sure, like most PBeM games they would fall apart within a few turns, but there were still people out there trying to give their roleplaying love a literary spin.<br/><br/>Things have changed.  First <i>pbem.com</i> went belly up and for a while there was no central place for people to go anymore.  Now there's <a href="http://www.pbem2.com/" rel="nofollow">PBeM2</a>, which is actually a lot more sophisticated technically but provides the kind of clearing-house venue <i>pbem.com</i> used to.  The problem: it's empty most of the time, unless you're really into <i>Star Trek</i> gaming and, well, I'm not.<br/><br/>What happened? I tend to think MMOs happened, or at least <i>World of Warcraft</i>. The thing about PBeMs is that they require some degree of effort and a full engagement of the imagination to be successful, much as tabletop RPGs do. Put this up against an MMO\u2019s snazzy graphics, ready-made gaming world and built-in reward system and there\u2019s no contest; most folks will gravitate to the MMO every time just because it's easier to get one's kicks out of it.  Plus, isn't everybody doing it?<br/><br/>This isn\u2019t to say that MMOs are any less fun or worthy of our affection. I\u2019ve spent my time in Azeroth and I can safely say I enjoyed myself. But I don't play <i>WoW</i> anymore and have seen my attention wander back to PBeMs. Why? Because as freeing as an MMO can be in terms of the heavy lifting of the imagination, it is also creatively stifling: one can never go beyond the limits of the game\u2019s design.<br/><br/>The great thing about fiction is that it can go anywhere and do anything. It\u2019s not constrained by budgets or rendering capability or the like. WoW can only do what it\u2019s programmed to do and no more. The NPCs never say or act any differently than their allotted roles allow. The world may expand as new products are released, but it never changes. A PBeM, on the other hand, has all the freedom it wants.<br/><br/>But as I say, the old world of PBeM is pretty much dead. Unless you\u2019re a dyed-in-the-wool <i>Trek</i> fan or a perv interested in writing interactive sex stories, you\u2019re out of luck.<br/><br/>How long has it been since you PBeM'd?  Or have you ever?  If you have, under what circumstances can you see yourself returning to it?  What would your preferring setting/game be?  How would you gather a dedicated player base?  And if you haven't, what would get you to try it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245243/#Comment_245243" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-05T09:53:13+00:00" title="December  5, 2009  9:53AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never played by email- the closest I've gotten is a couple of games via instant messenger.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245249/#Comment_245249" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-05T10:32:16+00:00" title="December  5, 2009 10:32AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See I'm exactly the opposite.

You said it already, most games fall apart after a few turns, it's hard to find a group that are all commited and capable of contributing regularly and in my experience agenda clashes pop up much more often over email and are harder to resolve than they do in person.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245524">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245524/#Comment_245524" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T10:42:58+00:00" title="December  7, 2009 10:42AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 7, 2009 10:53AM by MatrixGamer.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do it all the time.

The PBP games I've been in / ran that have been succesful have still broken down in this time, it's just that we felt like we'd achieved something by then (one superhero game petered out, entirely my fault as GM, just after trekking across an extra-dimensional desert to recover the rest of the city's heroes, but we'd had three big scenes by then, so it didn't feel entirely wasted. At least that's what I keep telling myself.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn contrast, the games that haven't worked out have also fallen apart after about the same time, but with nothing achieved (most have just had lots of in-character chit-chat). Maybe there's some mileage in looking at the form, and trying to only pitch games that can work out satisfactorily in 10-15 'turns'. In fact, I might just start doing that, and try running some again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachlan" title="lachlan"><img alt="lachlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachlan">lachlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245594/#Comment_245594" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T14:56:30+00:00" title="December  7, 2009  2:56PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A testable hypothesis!<br><br>I'm outta here -- I'll be back with some hard data in about 10 turns.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245595/#Comment_245595" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-07T15:03:53+00:00" title="December  7, 2009  3:03PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And then there are the rare games that just keep going surviving loss of old players and mods of new ones.

Mostly that's because one of the two moderators always has <i>something</i> going.  Right now there's a Serenity game, at least two 4e games (that are lasting longer than they have any right to), a PDQ game, a (floundering) Chronica Feudalis game and a Solar System Shadowrun game.  While proposed games do fall apart all of the time there, several are going strong due to a combination of inexplicably dedicated players and GM experience in pushing past the bumps.<br/><br/>Of course, instead of running PBF games, maybe I should be finishing the comic. :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246245/#Comment_246245" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-11T11:45:03+00:00" title="December 11, 2009 11:45AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My most recent PBeM experience was the OD&amp;D game I ran on twitter for about 3 months earlier this year.  As always with such things, it hit a wall and died away.  One of the conclusions that I took from it was that the PBeM feature of "always on" is in the long term a bug.  Because the game is never "not in progress", there is never an opportunity to step back and rebuild your creative juices.  I'm currently pondering what strategies could be employed to avoid this kind of burnout.<br/><br/>Obviously there are success cases, as people have mentioned above, they just seem to be more the exception than the rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246278/#Comment_246278" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-11T17:37:12+00:00" title="December 11, 2009  5:37PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the long running game I mentioned, turns come only on Monday, Wednesday and one on the weekend with semi regular breaks for holiday weekends and special stuff the GMs want to go off and do.  Also there are established protocols for players to have their characters written into the background for a hiatus and then spring back into the narrative when real life let's them come back to the game.  That regular but not always on posting schedule helped much to avoid burnout on both the GM and player side.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246380/#Comment_246380" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-12T22:20:29+00:00" title="December 12, 2009 10:20PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have had very, very bad experiences with asynchronous play, including play by e-mail.
