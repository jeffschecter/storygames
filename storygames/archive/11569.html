I'll start with the one-shot from Nerd by Nerd East.<br/><br/>I made a character who was a creepy historian / fortune-teller.  His main abilities centered on identifying "what's cool" and finding ways to claim "...so what we're doing is cool too, dammit!"  However, my vision was to do this in some sort of majestic "word of fate" context.  The other players had different ideas when creating their characters, and when we went to tie them all together in a MRCZ (aka company), there was no way for me to push for something grandiose.  The vibe was silly, so we went with "Teeth is the new black."<br/><br/>In a longer campaign, I probably would have eventually found a way to work in my preferred aesthetic for the character, and might have enjoyed the challenge of forcing it to fit... but for a one-shot, I found this less than ideal.  If I was running this, I'd brainstorm the MRCZ (at least a teeny bit) before char-gen.<br/><br/>As for the mechanics, the card-drawing and turn-spending is its own fun game.  The cards are pretty, the strategy is simple but usually not boringly obvious.  The handling time is way too long for me.  The fiction moves along in tiny increments amidst several minutes of staring at cards and character sheets.  <br/><br/>The mechanical decisions lead, and then it's up to the player to shoehorn in a fictional description to account for the decision.  (This reminded me of my Burning Empires game from last summer: in 8 sessions of play in a 5 player game, we had two players who were great at this, one player who started out bad but gradually improved, and two who started out bad and never improved.)  "I activate my geneline!"  "Which part?"  "Uh... I guess 'witty'."  "And how is wit going to help you convince the pubic to adore your ugly tooth fairy?"  "Uh..."  (Some floundering and failed attempts occur before we find something good enough to say "done" and move on.)<br/><br/>The high handling time produces a lot of watching for players whose characters aren't involved.  And, strategically, it's often wise to not be involved.  This bugs me.<br/><br/>A lot of this is simply my personal taste -- when I get psyched about the fiction, I prefer to stay inside it.  And FreeMarket definitely gets me psyched about the fiction.  <b>"Let's all team up and attempt cool projects together!"</b> is one of my favorite things to do in roleplaying.  The all-needs-met space station and vie-for-social-status culture is a <b>fantastic setting to do that in</b>.  Here's what happened in this game:<br/><br/>We started with a slogan of "teeth is the new black" (mishearing when one player said "tea is the new black").  We printed a tooth fairy to be our marketing tool, but we didn't have any printing skills, so it came out hideous.  Still, we decided to run with its "train wreck, can't look away" appeal.  We produced a video with the fairy, lit it and marionetted it to make it appealing, loaded in a lot of tooth fairy historical info to prove an enduring fad, and even got across "pliers and bags of teeth" as a new fashion trend.<br/><br/>We then started getting requests, but we had no pliers and bags to fill them.  So we did a deal with a guy who could provide these.  In return, he wanted our guy Kimball to lose to Joe at Snozzball.  Kimball refused, but was willing to make the target (Joe's daughter) THINK Joe had beaten him by implanting her with a false memory.  This worked, and our contact brought all our items to Pliers Promotion Night at the Snozzball arena.  While we led a "teeth!" chant in the crowd, Kimball proceeded to knock out a bunch of Joe's teeth, which our tooth fairy abomination collected.  The end.<br/><br/>The upshot of all these projects is a change in Flow.  I immediately latched onto the Flow concept as a sort of "coolness metric".  To me, that's fun, and fits in with all the stuff I like best about the game.  However, you only get Flow for certain game-defined activities and mechanics-uses, but not necessarily for accomplishing something in the fiction that seems popularity-raising.  "We started and supported a big fad, but because of our expenditures in the process, our Flow went down.  Huh?"<br/><br/>I mentioned this to Daniel, and he reminded me that Flow is also a measure of how many resources the station aggregate is willing to allocate to your projects.  Once he said it, I remembered it.  But it was easy for me to forget, because I didn't care about that part of the game.  Getting popular is fun!  Getting approval from the aggregate so you can advance a MRCZ Tier and move your operation somewhere comfy is (at least relatively speaking) boring.  We don't spend any play time on how uncomfortable the characters are in their storage unit, so I'm not motivated to improve that.<br/><br/>I guess I might be excited to have more station resources so I could do more ambitious projects, but I'm not clear on any cap on ambition in the first place, and my understanding of Flow as a "rating" inclines me to forget that it's also a resource you can spend.  Wait, am I using up the limited materials the station grants me?  I thought I was just putting my reputation on the line in a venture that could make me cooler or less cool!<br/><br/>I have no doubt that a long chat with Luke or Jared could make all of this make sense to me.  But without that, the fuzziness becomes distracting when relating the mechanics to the fiction.  The mechanics are telling me that I have a Margin of Victory that I can spend on either customizing my project outcome or on Efficiency, and that Efficiency is the one that immediately gets me a Flow "rebate" (which may exceed the Flow I spent/staked in the first place) -- and I'm wondering what the fuck just happened in the fiction as a result of printing a tooth fairy.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257636/#Comment_257636" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-22T14:37:35+00:00" title="February 22, 2010  2:37PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2010 2:45PM by Bret_Gillan.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're finding that the challenges are resulting in tedium with not enough fiction, your superuser should probably back off and let you guys automatically win some challenges until something big comes along so you can focus on the roleplaying and all that. I've gotten the impression you want to be doing a handful of conflicts a session and that's it. If you don't care and everyone is sitting around being bored, why are you guys playing it out as a challenge, you know?<br/><br/>I don't know why you say it's not wise for a group to be involved in a project. If a group of you are involved then you can actually get extra Flow back from the challenge if you succeed, unlike when you are doing a challenge alone. When a group invests flow in a project, individuals get back a percentage of the <i>total Flow invested</i> so having everyone throw in on a project is a way to rake in some major Flow. If four of us throw in 10 Flow apiece, if we succeed with 75% efficiency I get back <b>30 Flow</b> even though I only threw in 10. It is totally wise for a group to be involved and the system rewards it. If the group is sitting out on challenges and watching, they are wasting an opportunity.<br/><br/>I guess I'd need an example of where you had a hard time relating mechanics to fiction, but I think maybe you are worrying a little too much about directly mapping one onto the other. Like, every mathematical function applied to Flow doesn't need to be narrated.<br/><br/>I'm hoping to get to play it this weekend and I am looking forward to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257641/#Comment_257641" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-22T14:45:41+00:00" title="February 22, 2010  2:45PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, sounds like you're just grinding against what you want the game to be -- mechanics and fiction -- and what it actually is.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Bret pointed out, group challenges are the heart, soul and giant-Ed-McMahon-check of the setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the feedback!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257646/#Comment_257646" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-22T14:58:10+00:00" title="February 22, 2010  2:58PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2010 2:58PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Luke, yeah, that sounds right re: me &amp; the mechanics.

Luke was talking with my group about it when we played together over the weekend and he said that he'd had major problems with player buy-in when they didn't make their own characters.  I haven't run the game myself yet but I could totally see that being true.  Character creation is the chief way in which players get to create their characters' situation.  By making certain choices during Chargen, like Short- and Long-term Memory, your selection of Experiences, or the tags on your Tech, a player is injecting their situation down into the game fiction.  For example, during my first game of Freemarket I started with a simple character concept of "Architect" and, after pressing that through the chargen system, I came out with a Guerilla Aesthetic Recyclist on the other end, one with another MRCZ as his enemy, an obsession with stars, and a desire to name everything like it were a Kraftwerk song.    <br><br>We made characters for our session and it took about an hour and a half for four players.  I was the only one at the table that had read the book previously, besides Luke, and we got along just fine.  Questions were asked and answered regularly and it still didn't take that long to put things together.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257830/#Comment_257830" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T08:13:40+00:00" title="February 23, 2010  8:13AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2010 8:15AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bret, just brush up on the char-gen process before you do it.

There is no "wandering monster table" where owlbears show up and eat your flow. Even frownies are delivered because of some action on your part that elicited a response.

In the last session, the user put up his MRCZ for review and lost, which was a big hit to his flow.  Furthermore, he ended the session with less flow then he started, so his MRCZ flow went down even further.  He has two sessions to bring up his flow to the Tier 1 minimum, at which point he automatically will be reviewed (page 68).  If he loses this review, the MRCZ will be disbanded immediately.  It\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll be able to raise his flow to the Tier 1 minimum in two sessions, but even if he does, he\u2019ll have to risk 6 flow in the review challenge.  So he\u2019s also risking deportation from going into flow debt.<br/><br/>EDIT: In this explanation, I'm conflating the user's flow and his MRCZ flow.  It's been a while since this session occured.  I'll review my notes and come back to this.<br/>__________\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>My impression was that this would only come up if the players were really incompetent in planning and unlucky in execution.</blockquote>\nThis guy\u2019s been genuinely helpful to other users and made new friends, but still is having a hard time because of going it alone.  To the extent that it\u2019s put him in danger of MRCZ dissolution and banishment.

Let's talk about Actors or let's talk about Writers or let's talk about Teachers or let's talk about Academics.  Creating the group first would basically introduce an extra layer of social commentary that's probably a distraction.<br><br/>Creating the group second makes the group's endeavor virtually irrelevant because it's not about establishing a topic for commentary.  It adds kind of Terry Gilliam-esq absurdist element because WHAT you're trying to do doesn't matter.  It matters that you're trying to do it.  It's a game about social endeavors in the abstract (so absurdity actually aids that rather than obscures it) rather than a game about identity groups like Teachers or Actors.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258310/#Comment_258310" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T19:13:08+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  7:13PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nonviolent?

I didn't quite get why I was supposed to get into it. But... I haven't read the book. So, yeah, just talking, but I don't think it's over-analysis. For instance, without "getting it", I'm not going to play the game, because to me a vital piece is missing.

Or something like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258316/#Comment_258316" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T19:50:06+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  7:50PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah but I imagine it would have netted you a lot of frownies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258321/#Comment_258321" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T20:09:06+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  8:09PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/>\nThat's cool.

If this is from a Aggregate function that punish bad behaviours (wasting resources, wetworking people, forcing new trends in people's mind, etc.), it means in addition to this built-in algorithm of the Ag, there is the redundant Frownies function. The goal is to please other people, and a built-in static algorithm that decide of this pleasing seems contradictory. The way I see FreeMarket (the fictional station) is a big ad-hoc congratulations/blames social structure (Attaboys and Frownies). I think the ad-hoc contradicts with the algorithmic.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, I've troubles figuring how to manage a situation where a PC take an action that will plausibly bother sevaral people (say, a performance of really bad taste). Do the Superuser arbitrarily give the player an arbitrary number of Frownies ?
