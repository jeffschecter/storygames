It has a method that makes a group of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">grown up players</span> (not children, mind you) fall into a mood of tranquil all-encompassing love, or <i>harmony</i>. The game invariably leads to a state of harmony in and between the players. The game really does this to people (it has failed to deliver with one (1) player of mine during the years).<br/><br/>I believe it is time for me to go deeper into this game now, describing it in more detail, and make a decision about publishing it anew, and maybe translating it too ...<br/><br/>So I would like you to read the following, and speak your mind. What do you think? Is this a game you would contemplate buying, and playing? Would you like to be a "muu", and part of "Allmuu"?<br/><br/><b>The method</b> (summarized)\n<ul><li>You have a <i>muu-leader</i> (ML) and three to six players.</li>\n<li>The players get to make their own "muu" (a humanoid of clumsy nature, with no language, but with shared dreams and feelings; "emo-pathy").</li>\n<li>The muu is made by placing a given number of points on four "abilities": Strength, Quickness, Curiosity and Suspicion.</li>\n<li>The setting is simple; a clearing in the woods, with a big tree, a pond and a brook. It is described using a na\xefve-poetic game-language, forcing the players into a "muu-mode" of thinking and talking.</li>\n<li>The setting is given in a lightly coloured map, which depicts grass and trees and stones and water, with names derived from the na\xefve-poetic game-language. Muu's in the game is represented with a small glass-bead; one in the beginning and more during the game, as muu and muu and muu wanders their separate ways ...</li>\n<li>The muu-leader is responsible for setting the right play-mode intitially, and deepening it, by using a calm and friendly voice, giving each player good smiles, greeting them with a handshake, and by using the na\xefve-poetic game-language in all her descriptions.</li>\n<li>The game proceeds in a very calm fashion, alternating between feelings and actions, using playing cards (one suit from Ace to King per player) to indicate actions (each card represent one kind of action; walking, running, bathing, searching, looking about, etc.).</li>\n<li>The game was sold solely through a one-day "muu-leader school", where future muu-leaders learned how to use and develop the game-language, how to use their voice, and how to "muu'ify their descriptions" (to make players part-take in the wonder of being a muu).</li></ul>\nThere where never any predetermined plot in the game. No pre-made scenario were ever used in a game of Muu.<br/><br/>"Being a muu" was always about awakening under "Bigtree", wandering about in the clearing, searching for "Starmoss" and "Pearlflowers" to eat, and the mythical "Daystrawberry" (very important myth in the game, propels a lot of dreaming and searching by muu), taking small naps (player going to the loo/the kitchen/the phone, muu sleeping and dreaming), investigating "Tree" or "Stone" or "Spring", or venturing into "Alltree" (the forest), gathering as "allmuu" (all muu's go together to cuddle each other, sharing emotions in a very strong and healthy way), or investigating the "Bigmuu" (a stave in the ground, with a stick fastened near the top, "the greatest entrepreneurical feat ever achieved by a muu"). Muu and muu and muu goes about doing these things, and when the day closes it is good to return to "Bigtree" again, and sleep, and dream ...<br/><br/>And in all these wandering, which may bring the various muu's in all directions, each and every muu is aware of the feelings in Allmuu.<br/><br/>Some singing may occur during a muu-day.  The muu singing with joy is a very strong myth in the game, and a very strong tool to use by the players. The player of a muu singing, will have to make up a muu-song on the spot and sing it to the other players.<br/><i>- NB: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">every single muu-song</span> ever made in my muu-games, have been a resounding success. I've seen players cry with joy after singing their muu-song.</i><br/><br/><b>Actual play:</b><br/><i>- with three muu's, and with the muu-leader using a calm and friendly voice all the time</i><br/>ML: It is a nice day. Muu awakens. Bigtree is over muu, and Ground is under muu. Bigwarm-Muu is tickling muu with long, warm fingers. What do muu feel?<br/>Muu: I feel happy!<br/>Muu: I feel anticipation!<br/>Muu: I feel anticipation!<br/>ML: Allmuu is happy and full of anticipation. It is a nice day. What do muu do?<br/>(the players choose a card, in secret, to indicate an action)<br/>ML: So; what will muu do? Turn your cards, please.<br/>Muu (turns a 3; run): Muu will run!<br/>Muu (turns a 10; eat): Muu will eat!<br/>Muu (turns a Queen; cuddle): Muu will cuddle with Bigwarm-Muu!<br/>(the ML ponders if there are any actions that may influence other actions, and decides there are not, she then focus on one player in turn)<br/><br/>ML (to the player with running muu): Where will Muu run?<br/>Muu: To Spring!<br/>ML: And will muu run normal, or fast?<br/>Muu: Fast!<br/>ML: Then you will roll the die for Quickness, to see how fast muu is running.<br/>(the player rolls the die, a D20, and gets 18, which is more than his Quickness, and a failure)<br/>ML: Muu is running very fast! Muu see the arms moving faster than ever! And Bigtree is running alongside muu! It is very exciting!<br/>(ML touches the glass-bead on the map, without moving it, to indicate that muu has not actually moved ... but give no further explanation)<br/><br/>ML (to the player with eating muu): What will muu eat?<br/>Muu: Starmoss!<br/>ML: Muu is hungry. Muu would like to eat starmoss. Muu has no starmoss to eat. No starmoss in the mouth of muu. No starmoss in the hands of muu. Muu is lying on the back thinking of starmoss, the taste of starmoss, the starryness of starmoss, the softness ... Mmmm-muu is, almost, in a starmossy state, but muu is still hungry ...<br/><br/>ML (to the player with cuddling muu): Muu wants to cuddle with Bigwarm-muu, and Bigwarm-Muu is cuddling muu. Bigwarm-Muu seems to be hiding up in Bigtree, so muu cannot reach Bigwarm-Muu to cuddle back. Muu stretches towards Bigwarm-Muu with arms too short.<br/><br/>ML: What do muu feel?<br/>Muu: Happiness!<br/>Muu: Sorrow!<br/>Muu: Sorrow!<br/>ML: Allmuu feels a lot of sorrow, and that is a <i>strong </i>feeling, so the happiness in muu (nods towards the happy muu) is changed to sorrow too. Allmuu feels very sorrowful! It is a sad day. What do muu do?<br/>(each player picks a card, in secret)<br/>ML: So; what will muu do? Turn your cards, please.<br/>Muu (turns a 2; walk): Muu will go out of Bigtree!<br/>Muu (turns a Queen; cuddle): Muu will cuddle!<br/>Muu (turns a 5; climb): Muu will climb into Bigtree!<br/>(the ML ponders if there are any actions that may influence other actions, and decides there are; the cuddling muu may interfere with either the walking or climbing muu)<br/><br/>ML (to the cuddling muu): Which muu will muu cuddle?<br/>(player points to the player with climbing muu)<br/>ML (to the cuddling muu): Roll your die for Strength.<br/>ML (to the climbing muu): Roll your die for Quickness.<br/>(cuddling player rolling 1 and climbing player rolling 12, giving the cuddling player an "impossible" result, and the initiative)<br/><br/>ML (to the climbing muu): Muu tries to climb Bigtree, but muu comes and cuddles muu, and the cuddling is so soft and warm and tender and good that muu forgets all about Bigtree and Bigwarm-Muu, and just enjoys the pure cuddly-mood muu gets into; there is no more sorrow in muu.<br/><br/>ML (to the cuddly muu): Muu cuddles with muu, and makes very soft and warm and tender and good cuddle. But muu does not cuddle back, so muu is left as sorrowful as before; muu gets one Hurt (points to the sheet, where "Hurt" has a small box, and tell the player to set a mark there).<br/>ML (explains to all players): All [i]Hurt [/i]is minus to all die rolls, and will continue to give minus until [i]Hurt [/i]is removed by muu.<br/>Muu: How do we remove it?<br/>ML: By muu.<br/>Muu: What?<br/>ML (still in a calm voice, smiling): Exactly. Lets play on.<br/><br/>ML (to the walking muu): Muu rise from the starrybed muu has slept on, and walks out of Bigtree. Muu see Tree and Tree, and Alltree (puts a bead on the "wrong" side of Bigtree, to indicate that muu has left Bigtree in the wrong direction, not towards Spring). Bigwarm-Muu is trying to cuddle muu, but it helps not. Muu is still full of sorrow; muu gets one Hurt (indicates the box on the sheet).<br/><br/>ML (a little sadness in her eyes; nods towards muu with Hurt): Muu have Hurt and feel sorrow. Sorrow is not good for muu. Sorrow is Hurt.<br/>ML (sad eyes, sad smile; nods towards second muu with Hurt): Muu have Hurt and feel sorrow. Sorrow is not good for muu. Sorrow is Hurt.<br/>ML (smiling, looking at the third muu): What do muu feel?<br/>Muu: Am I free to feel anything?<br/>ML (a radiant smile now): Muu has been cuddled very, very good, so muu has very strong feelings now, and may feel anything.<br/>Muu: Muu feels ecstatic!<br/>ML (calm voice, smiling): Allmuu feels a lot of sorrow, and a strong ecstasy! Allmuu feels opposite! It is strange being Allmuu today. What do muu do?<br/><br/>- and so it goes on, and on, and on, in the same calm fashion, with feelings and actions alternating, until Allmuu is sated with muu'ish-ness and all decides to pick the Knave (sleeping). Then Allmuu goes to sleep, and muu and muu and muu have their dreams (which is written down on small pieces of paper, and read out loud). <br/><br/><b>Example of muu-dreams</b> (actual dreams from played games):<br/><i>- Muu dreams that Allmuu cuddles, and sleeps, and eats.<br/>- Muu dreams that muu is bathing in Spring while muu dreams about the day muu eats Daystrawberries and is cosy.<br/>- Muu dreams of Bigspring, and of Holespring which became Pokespring. Muu dreams of Heatherhoney and cuddling ...<br/>- Muu dreams that muu eats a lot. Muu becomes full.</i><br/><br/>And all is well, and the game is over ...<br/>_______________________________<br/><br/><b>Please speak you mind:</b><br/>- What do you think?<br/>- Is a strong sense of harmony something you would appreciate to experience in a role-playing game?<br/>- Is this a game you would contemplate buying, and playing? <br/>- Would you like to be a "muu", and part of "Allmuu"?<br/>- Would you like to dream about being a muu ...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287065/#Comment_287065" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T02:49:01+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  2:49AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            muu speaking mind...<br/>\n<br/>\nit's interesting, thanks very much for sharing.

I've seen others strive towards similar games (trying to make Moomin games is a pretty common thing in Finland), but you're clearly ahead of anything I've seen. I would fully expect this to make an impressive product when written down comprehensively and with conviction. I could easily believe that the time for an international publication for this is now. I'd buy it for retail.<br><br>That being said, I doubt that I could be convinced to play this myself. It's too philosophically opposed to my own sense of being. The sort of ego manipulation and deprogramming going on in this is so very contrary to European civilization that I have an instinctive dislike for it, the same as I have for any communally transcendental religious experiences. I fear that I'd rather be a bitter, over-intellectual, individualistic egotist than a muu.<br><br>Would you say that the systemic bits we see in the write-up are arbitrary GM preferences, or does this thing have rules? For instance, I could imagine the rule being that the game ends when a majority of the players picks the Knave, while a minority pick just leads to the one muu napping for a round while the others continue doing things. Is this the way it goes, or am I reading too much structure into it?<br><br>It comes to me that this game could probably use custom cards instead of a normal deck, depending on how many different actions there are.

It's hard to sell "walking about for a day, eating, bathing, cuddling, doing nothing special" ... in competition with playing WWII, or Paranoia, or a game of dragon-bashing.

This would make a heck of a Mumintroll game (he says, with his foul Swedish accent). I'd love to own this, and play it with my kids. I think they'd take to it even more than they would, for example, Happy Birthday Robot or The Prince's Kingdom, and it arguably is more effective at teaching community, peace, and similar values - and to serve as an intro to storytelling and role playing games.

When the first novelty of being a muu pass, there are multitudes of ways to explore what being a muu may imply for you, personally. And being a muuleader is really remarkable with experienced players; they drive most of the game themselves, being familiar with the gametalk, with the limits and challenges of being a muu, and being aware of the randomness that dominates the life of muu (and consequently; Allmuu). And having experienced players invent their own version of Allmuu is over-the-top thrilling. Talking about it makes me really soft with fond memories ...<br/><br/>So I hope you try it, Quentin, and hope it will leave you in want for more ...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>you do <b>not</b> intend it for children ...

Very good tip! Will take that into consideration if "text-only" fails me. Thanks!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Yes, this sounds very much like a project created primarily in non-textual ways.</blockquote>It was, in fact, the fruit of years of turning ideas and experimenting with design between me and Jon, another gamer/designer. Three themes from our creative discourse crystallized in Muu:<br/>- role-playing in a non-violent environment (we discussed the overloaded focus on violence in rpgs a lot)<br/>- mind-reading characters (I had a bad experience with this in another game, and we discussed ways of doing it better)<br/>- secret action-choices (we discussed, and experimented with, lots of innovative game-techniques, some good, some baaad)<br/><br/>So, for years me and Jon discussed things like this, and made small games to see our ideas in action. And then, one night, I could not sleep, and I sat down to write something ... and in the morning I had the core of Muu. During the next day I finished it (at work, skulking about), and brought it to my local club that evening. Jon was there, and joined in the first game of Muu, which he has recorded in our club-magazine, under the title; "Tomas strikes again"! It was tuesday, 2.may, 1989. Jon describes the game as "very entertaining and rewarding". :-)<br/><br/>Muu has stayed the same in all essentials since then. A new edition will be true to the old game. No need to put anything new into it. The challenge is to convey how this game may be played by book (bar the idea to make a visual/audio-demo of the game), and really have Muu come to life all over the world ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287336/#Comment_287336" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T16:08:20+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  4:08PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is exciting!

Muu conveyed the feeling that everything was allowed in gaming - including being serious about it".</i><br/><br/><i>Muu</i> was something quite out of the ordinary back then, in 1989. There has been great developments in rpgs since, especially from 2000 and forth.

Sometimes things just push your buttons.  I have friends who express strong negative opinions about the show "Barney and Friends" even though their kids were enthralled by it.  They saw messages in it that they disagreed with, or they found the voices irritating, or they were appalled by the god-awful songs...all kinds of objections, all kinds of real loathing directed at what is meant to be the most innocuous and inoffensive children's TV show that anyone could possibly design.  And they're not wrong to feel that way, or alone in feeling that way.<br/><br/>Likewise, you can look at "a game about harmony" and even be a huge fan of harmony in real life, but still find something about that game which rubs you exactly the wrong way.  <br/><br/>Basically, someone's going to dislike just about anything you could name....but the cool part is that someone else will probably like that thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287435/#Comment_287435" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T00:53:45+00:00" title="August 19, 2010 12:53AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero!

It's just an answer to the question, and a stab at an explanation for why not. "Ego manipulation" and "social deprogramming" are what a game of this sort mostly has to do to break down the instinctive barriers the players have for their everyday life in society, barriers that need to be lowered to garner the necessary amount of mutual trust and relaxation for the emotional effects Tomas describes; I intended it as an explanatory description of what I don't like, not as any sort of strongly negative moral judgment.

Matthijs the Muuleader has even used some of the wordings from my game!<br/><br/>And that's fine with me, because <i>Star Moss</i> certainly got some heavy muu'ish-ness to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287482/#Comment_287482" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T08:25:44+00:00" title="August 19, 2010  8:25AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AFT &amp; Eero--I understand what you were both saying much better now, thanks for the explanation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_287591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287591/#Comment_287591" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T13:06:16+00:00" title="August 19, 2010  1:06PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            NIce to see that you are friends!

The muuleader play on this by being very inclusive in her behavior towards the players, and by using conscious calming techniques. The techniques are simple, and effective. A vast majority of players become calm in this game, and are thus able to enjoy the tranquil flow of it. And calm people tend to drift towards harmony.<br/><br/>So; if the player pointed to another Muu, the muuleader would go with it, transforming it into "muuness" (as is always done, of course); "Muu nibbles on muu, disturbing muu in cuddling muu. And muu makes a song that is not a song, when muu nibble it. Muu is still hungry, for nibbling muu fills no muu".<br/><br/>In this way the player will get the "crunch" (muu does what he tells it to), but the game is not compromised and muuness is preserved. And of course; in this small action lies the seed of developing muu too; maybe muu could discover tickling, and the song of laughter ... ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arvid" title="Arvid"><img alt="Arvid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arvid">Arvid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287965/#Comment_287965" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T17:34:14+00:00" title="August 20, 2010  5:34PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2010 5:34PM by Arvid.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so you've already decided, but I'd buy Muu.
