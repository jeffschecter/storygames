ever. Apart from the Asshat Bickering one, obviously.<br/><br/>Someone wanted me to expand on this:-<br/><br/>"Oh! And Ars Magica taught me that roleplaying was a broader and more exciting hobby than I had originally thought, and that a lot of my assumptions were crazy monkey-gibbering."<br/><br/>Which gives me another opportunity to talk about The Best Game I've Never Actually Played.<br/><br/>I came across Ars M (the 2nd edition) in a review in Dragon magazine, which I read over and over. Man, I *wanted* that book. But I was a kid, and bad at pocket-money management, and the only gamestore I knew that might sell it was hundreds of miles away.<br/><br/>Some years occured. A new game store opened nearby, and I bought the Covenants supplement. I didn't have enough money for the main rulebook, and figured I could at least use Covenants for other games. <br/><br/>I read it. My brain exploded. I read it again. The exploded bits of my brain exploded into smaller bits. <br/><br/>I spent *weeks* making Covenants according to the rules (half of which I didn't understand, on account of not owning the core rulebook), and rereading the samples in the back of the book. I did eventually get a copy of the rulebook. I convinced the FLGS-guy to let me trade in the copy of Dangerous Journeys: Aeaeaeaeaerth Beastiary for it (I believe my arguement went: "Who needs stats for penguins!?"). But it was the 3rd edition rulebook, in which the game had already bloated beyond the haunting, sparse beauty and draughty possibilities of 2nd edition. I could never convince anyone to play it.<br/><br/>Now, I got into Ars Magica straight from AD&amp;D, so a lot of its ideas looked to me like they'd come straight from the moon. I know other games did some of this stuff earlier, but it wasn't many, and Ars M was the first place I'd seen it.<br/><br/>Below, I have catalogued the assumptions that Ars Magica took out back, hit with a brick, and buried under the patio:-<br/><br/>1. There can be only one GM. And it's me!<br/>2. You have one character. One! What do you want more characters for? If you have more than one character you're obviously not role-playing because you are not utterly immersed in a single viewpoint!<br/>3. All characters are created equal. Otherwise, the game is not Balanced. Good games are Balanced.<br/>4. You start at low level, you play, you reach high level. You DO NOT start at mid or high-level. That's powergaming! <br/>5.  <i>Good </i>system is <i>generic</i> system.<br/>6. Character creation is a sacred, solitary thing. The characters at the table do not have relationships except those that develop over a long campaign - it's the GM's job to connect them.<br/>7. Characters have stats. Monsters have stats. Social institutions do not have stats.<br/>8. Every character must be good at combat.<br/>9. Downtime activity (research, creation, etc) isn't what gaming is about, because it's time away from the Plot.<br/>10. Character advancement must be tied to killing things and taking their stuff.<br/>11. The GM has a Plot. The reward for playing is that you get to see more of the GM's Plot. That is the reason the PCs are there. The PCs do not have ambitions distinct from the Plot. That's being a Bad Player.<br/>12. Good stories are about knocking  something down (a Big Bad) not building something up (a community). Games *need* a big bastard at the end to murder. How else will you know good has triumphed?<br/>13. Group-creation of game-stuff is rubbish. It's designing by committee, which cannot create anything of value. Only I can create things of value! I am a unique and beautiful snowflake, and that's why I'm the fucking GM! Storyguide! Whatever!<br/>12. History is boring. (I now have a master's degree in history. This is Ars Magica's fault).<br/><br/>I'm still gobsmacked by how revolutionary Ars Magica was. Obviously, much of the above was just me being a muppet, but it still had a pile of stuff that flew in the face of the conventions of the day:-<br/><br/>1. Collaborative setting/situation creation<br/>2. A meta-character in the Covenant <br/>3. Shared PCs (the grogs)<br/>4. A shared GM role<br/>5. Integration of rules and setting (particularly the Houses or the Order)<br/><br/>IT BLOWS MY MIND!<br/><br/>Has anyone else got a game that shattered their expectations of the hobby?

Named bonuses, energy times, power classfications -- all tremendously useful expressions of a concept that had heretofore never been applied with particular attention in RPGs (which were built more like case law) but which are inherent to all games. <br/><br/>It also helped me understand a particular problem in game design where the projected output of the rules of a dice-based system is falsely assumed to be equivalent to the average result.<br/><br/>For instance, we can make pretty accurate guesses about what 100,000 +6 bonus DC 15 skill checks will work out to on average. However, the chance of actually scoring that average once is very bad. Now consider that in many cases players will cycle through multiple rule systems, so they aren't actually making the same check over and over. This means that expecting the average is a bad habit and you are, in fact, likely to get all kinds of wacky results and not what you might infer.<br/><br/>This is an issue that comes to a head with something like BW's Let it Ride, where a system that's supposed to help the player actually denies her access to distributed results.<br/><br/>There's an interesting relationship between this and standard, repetitive checks. Rollin 100 Search checks is boring, but the distribution might help players feel that they can rely a bit more on how things will turn out in the long run. Over on Mearls' LJ the suggestion to use Let It Ride to avoid boredom came up, and I rejected it because of the distribution issue. It did however inspire an alternative to Let it Ride that takes care of the GM harrassment issue that might come up from demanding rerolls -- the GM asks for the roll, but it is averaged with all previous successive rolls of the same type, so that results achieve more consistency over time in a way that protects the player, but also allows the GM to intervene when somebody's blown their first go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102238/#Comment_102238" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T10:14:37+00:00" title="October 10, 2007 10:14AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>This is an issue that comes to a head with something like BW's Let it Ride, where a system that's supposed to help the player actually denies her access to distributed results.</blockquote>\nMalcolm, I'm not following you.

Where does it say "Let it Ride" is supposed to help the player? I thought it was about not letting narrative control negate the results of a conflict after it has been decided.<br/><br/>The rule is IIRC (I don't have my copy of BW by the computer) presented as a direct response to the GM hosing the players by requiring another roll. The issues I see with it are:<br/><br/>1) It is equally punitive to GMs who want to give players another chance.<br/>2) It doesn't really negate narrative control, as there is no real firm guidelines for when the situation changes. The example in the BW core actually has the situation change (the terrain for tracking, again, IIRC) and says that this isn't enough to call for a new roll. The example also makes the player fail.<br/>3) It slows down the process of getting distributed results for an action because you don't get to roll as often. This reduces the number of dice rolls which is convenient, but I don't think the tradeoff is worth it.<br/><br/>What I propose is an alternative that keeps you rollin dice but does not discard the original result. Alternately, here's what we can do:<br/><br/><b>Ride it Out</b><br/><br/>The player determines a duration for the use of a single skill. The duration determines the number of times she rolls:<br/><br/>(Will have to be tweaked through playtesting)<br/>1 turn/occasion: roll once.<br/>1-2 scenes with at least two uses: roll twice and average the results.<br/>2-3 scenes scenes with at least three uses: roll three times and average the results.<br/>1-2 sessions with at least four uses: roll four times and average the results.<br/><br/>The *player* decides roll frequencies and can decide to roll on each occasion. The tradeoff is that rolling more frequently provides less predictable results, but can allow a second chance when the player doesn't like a result, or she can set checks in advance with more predictable results, but is stuck with that average.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102366/#Comment_102366" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T20:06:34+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  8:06PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Question!<br/>What the heck is Sea Dracula?
