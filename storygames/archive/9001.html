I've been to many conventions and played in many convention games, and had a blast.  However, I've never before <span style="text-decoration: underline;">run</span> a game at a convention other than a large-scale LARP, and that was a completely different affair of event micro-management.<br/><br/>This weekend, at GameStorm, I'm running my first ever con game.  I'm running <i>three</i>, in fact, <i>and</i> they are sessions of a game that I wrote myself.  Needless to say, I'm nervous as all get-out.  I've got all the paperwork printed, and even wrote a personal self-only "mission statement" to help psych myself up before each session.<br/><br/>What advice can you offer for a first-time Convention GM who is otherwise accomplished in the home gaming arena?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198868/#Comment_198868" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-26T08:30:35+00:00" title="March 26, 2009  8:30AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2009 8:31AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Be prepared, whatever that means (for me it means a full water bottle and a good night's sleep).

Make it big. By the end of it are your lips flapping? Do your cheeks feel loose? If not, repeat until they are.<br/><br/>* Say "nnnnnnn" on the left side of your mouth. Say it on the right side of your mouth. Do this three times on each side.<br/><br/>* Say "Mumula" and on the "la" open your eyes and mouth as wide as you possibly can. Do this 20 times.<br/><br/>* Say "Red Letter, Yellow Letter", starting very very slow, over-articulating, then increase speed to your normal talking speed. Do the same for "teaching ghosts to sing", "unique New York" and the names of the characters in your scenario.<br/><br/>* Raise your hands above your head as far as you can, standing on your tiptoes, hold it for four seconds. Return to normal posture. Do this five times.<br/><br/>* Lean on the wall, reach back lift and catch your left ankle, pull gently. Do the same with your right leg. Do this twice for each leg.<br/><br/>* Stand normally, then reach downward with your right hand, bending only at your waist. Return to standing normally. Do this three times with each hand.<br/><br/>* Stand and breathe as deeply as you possibly can, slow and relaxed, in through the nose and out through the mouth. About a minute of this.<br/><br/>This is not some kind of exercise, this is warming up the muscles, if anything starts to hurt, don't do it so much or so hard. At the end you should feel loose and energized. And yes, bring water.<br/><br/>Edit: And before anyone asks, YES I ACTUALLY DO THIS. I do it before normal gaming sessions too.

(Then explain running multiple chapters at the end, though con games almost never do more than one chapter.)<br/><br/>So break down your rules in that manner. Character creation, in particular, can be a time-suck; have some set of questions to help drive folks to the "class" or whatever they'll most enjoy. Don't worry about giving them every, exhausting option: make them tell you about what they'd like to play, after your Setting Pitch, and then basically build their PC for them. Obviously, have some pre-gens of "common" archetypes for gamers (NOT for just your game; see Bartle) and offer them if someone mentions one as their "favorite" type of character. Just be like, "OK, here's something similar--buy a few more Power with the remaining points and give a name and background" or whatever.

I've GMed a lot of con games over a lot of years and the bases are very well covered here. The only thing I have to add is that a four hour con slot is far shorter than you can possibly imagine right now. Focus is critical at a convention game and the players may even hold you accountable if you let <i>them</i> get off track. There is no time for out of game talking, funny stories, movie quotes, or anything else that is not the game. <br/><br/>Now if your game runs in under four hours normally, you might not have a problem. But most new GMs have a very hard time finishing what they have prepared within the slot. So don't have too much game prepared. Have a watch and check it often and start wrapping up at least a half-hour before the end of the slot. Jason listed "finish on time" above, but I'm foot-stomping it because I think one of the worst sins is running long. Your players may want to eat between games or maybe they'll have their own game to run in the next slot. It's a matter of courtesy to finish on time so you don't force them to "quit" the game before the end. At the very least be aware of the end of the slot and let players go at that point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198969/#Comment_198969" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-26T16:32:59+00:00" title="March 26, 2009  4:32PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: scottdunphy</cite>Have a watch and check it often and start wrapping up at least a half-hour before the end of the slot</blockquote>\nQuote for Truth.  I make sure my phone is out and I can see what time it is at any point.  But that said, don't be afraid to take breaks.  I like to take five at least once an hour, to get up, stretch, let me mind process what's gone on, etc.  I don't always do this every hour, but I try to be mindful of it.<br/><br/>And relax.  I like to joke that "players can smell fear," but it's true -- others have said to walk in confident, and that's a big deal.<br/><br/>It might not apply to you much since it's your game, but avoid rule look-ups like the plague.  If you have to make some sort of judgment call on the fly, err on the side of "what would be fun?" rather than "what would be right?"  A con game isn't the same sort of beast as even a one-shot home game, since you're having to spend the first little bit of time quickly building a rapport with the other people around the game.<br/><br/>One thing I do is always take a blank piece of paper and draw boxes on it, corresponding to where the players are sitting. I write their name on top of the box and their character's name &amp; whatever pertinent information I feel is needed for that session in the box.  I usually don't have to refer to it afterward, but I do that in order to get my mind to remember this information  (as I'm a bit of a kinesthetic learner -- your mileage may vary).<br/><br/>And design the scenario in your mind has having multiple pieces you can bring in or ditch without breaking the game -- you might find you'll run through your game in 90 minutes because there wasn't enough, or it would have taken an extra 90 minutes because it was too much.  Hard to predict when you don't know who you'll have at the table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198971/#Comment_198971" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-26T16:44:35+00:00" title="March 26, 2009  4:44PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>One thing I do is always take a blank piece of paper and draw boxes on it, corresponding to where the players are sitting.

I'm from Denmark and our way of running games sound a bit differently from what I'm used to. You mention, for instance, these "dice", and I can't recall when I last used those at a con.<br/>\nAnywho, I've been running games at cons for 17 years, and for the past ten or so, that's all I do at cons. usually five or six games.<br/>\nWhile I agree with (some of) the previous points, here's what I do.<br/>\nFirst off, talk to the players. Ask what they usually play, what type of characters they usually play. If they respond with "warrior" og "Mage", I sigh, gently, and prepare to be disappointed. If they respond with personalities, that's a different matter.<br/>\nI warm up the players. I have a series of drama exercises that force the players out of their shell. While I know some prefer simple childrens games, I prefer to run a fast-paced quarrel. What I do is take two players and put them in front of each other, standing. One plays the man, the other the woman. I then add problems to their conversation (she's extatically telling you about the new handbag she just bought, and you just got fired) and then suddenly pulling one player out and pulling in another to take over the part, or suddenly switching roles between the two active players.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt works, it gets their heartrate up and and it forces them to think fast. It also allows me to get a measure of their playing skill, and I use it to cats them for their characters. It takes 15-30 minutes, but gets them into character MUCH faster. In my experience it nets me an extra hour of quality playtime.<br/>\nAfter this bit of sport, I give them the character, give them 60 seconds to skim the sheet (just the description, not the rules if there are any, and if there are, I usually ignore them utterly anyway) and then start with the intro scene.<br/>\nAfter the intro scene, they get time to realy read their characters, because by then they've already tried playing them and have a good idea about the underlying person of the character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203253/#Comment_203253" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-23T07:19:52+00:00" title="April 23, 2009  7:19AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2009 7:21AM by Steve_Segedy.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>This is not some kind of exercise, this is warming up the muscles, if anything starts to hurt, don't do it so much or so hard.

How do your players react when you bring a cacodemon to the table?<br/><br/>One other thing I'd suggest in addition to making introductions and so forth- start off by reiterating what the game is about and what they'll be doing during the session.  Don't count on them having read and understood the description in the convention handbook, give them the pitch just before the game and give them a final chance to bow out before it starts.  They can always leave later if they aren't having fun, but it's a disruption you could avoid at the start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaldfont" title="chaldfont"><img alt="chaldfont" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaldfont">chaldfont</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203282/#Comment_203282" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-23T09:48:00+00:00" title="April 23, 2009  9:48AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everything will take waaaay longer than you think it will.
