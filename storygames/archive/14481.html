The Pendragon stuff kicks off shortly after the 30 minute mark.<br/><br/>Luke, specifically, had no encounter with <i>Pendragon</i> before his gang picked it up to play. And yet, two things are true: a) he absolutely loves it; b) he's finding it extremely, extremely strange. <br/><br/>Have people listened to the the second half of the podcast? What did you think of Luke's summary? What have been your experiences with <i>Pendragon</i>, if any? If you've had none, does Luke's excitable rant make the game something seem like something you'd want to play? If you've played, how did the weird features Luke talks about work for you? If you haven't, what do you think would be your response to the strange mechanics Luke's talks about with such glee and lover's touch of frustration?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329548/#Comment_329548" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T00:41:10+00:00" title="June 14, 2011 12:41AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I listened to the whole podcast last night. I always (ALWAYS) thought that the winter phase in Mouse Guard was inspired by or an hommage to Pendragon, funny to learn that Luke didn't even know the game when he wrote MG.<br/><br/>King Arthur Pendragon is my most treasured old roleplaying book - but I've only played one campaign (which I ran), and it was back in the late 1990s I think. My roleplaying friends at that time were also rather shocked, especially by the personality mechanics, which were the part I liked the most. Everyone did enjoy character/family creation, and the idea of running an estate/family rather than just a character. I would love to play it again - as per the rules.<br/><br/>Some of us stole the personality mechanics and adapted them to an FBI campaign than ran for years, though the rolls (and effects) were voluntary and not imposed, which was a bit wiffy. Meaning, you could be brave as hell according to your character sheet and then act cowardly as fuck without any penalty. I found that less than fulfilling. I mostly used it to inspire my character's actions - like rolling for truthful or whatever before deciding whether to tell the truth or not.<br/><br/>Per                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329549/#Comment_329549" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T01:04:00+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  1:04AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does it matter so much which edition?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329553/#Comment_329553" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T02:42:16+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  2:42AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2011 2:59AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hans,<br/><br/>For the purposes of this discussion, it does not matter which edition.

The knights don't know what Merlin is up to and he doesn't tell them. The scenario as laid out in the GPC is a pretty hard railroad and even ends with a note acknowledging it. Pretty much the only way to avoid it is to decide not to help Merlin when he asks you for it at the very beginning of the scenario.<br/><br/>I could tell the players were feeling railroaded and helpless because normally a hard situation like that would see them swing into action with some sort of crazy scheme. Instead they were mostly passive, concerned only with spending the time between the accusation and the trial to go home to their manors and try to make heirs with their wives.<br/><br/>To cap it all off, a part of the advancement in KAP is random. You roll to see whether any of the traits, passions or skills you used successfully in the course of play go up. In the normal course of play, you have to roll the rating of your ability or less on a d20 in order to succeed. But when doing experience rolls, you have to roll above your rating. The idea, or course, being that as you advance an ability it becomes more difficult to advance. But Luke managed to not advance a single ability last night, even the one rated at 5. It was a down note to end a down session. <br/><br/>Hopefully next year is better. I find myself very much looking forward to the Anarchy Phase, which is fast approaching, in that the campaign becomes far less scripted from that point on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329582/#Comment_329582" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T07:09:48+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  7:09AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not happy accident that King Arthur Pendragon is my favorite RPG of all time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI run a game of it locally for my game group, set in Cameliard (Leodegrance's kingdom along the Welsh border) during Uther's reign in Logres. Jeremy Keller's knight wants to be Guinevere's true father. He's a sick puppy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one change that was requested was some kind of anti-whiff factor mechanic. I think my group is fond of points to spend to keep failure from happening. What we settled on was giving each player a coin; during the game, they could spend the coin to improve a result (critical failure -&gt; failure, failure -&gt; success, success -&gt; critical success). If they spent it on themselves, nothing extra happened. If they spent it on another knight, and narrated some justification, they got 50 Glory.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeedless to say, this was a popular move.

I own every single edition (except for the second) and I've been trying to complete my collection of the Beaumaines fan-zine for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nLOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said...its BRP...with all of the bullshit broken nonsense BRP brings with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a couple of key hacks that we did to make it work. First, we trebled the skill points received in the non knightly skills at start of play.  There's a bunch of fun variety between the different knightly backgrounds but when that variety results in a skill of 2 or 3 in something (roll under on 1d20) its utterly pointless. At least with a 6 or a 9 it was worth trying to use.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen for advancement we checked each skill EVERY time it was used, not just the first time (once per battle, not swing for fighty skills).  Each extra check on the skill then gave a +1 to the d20 advancement roll which helped some of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll have to check out the interview.  We played the hell out of that game back in day.  Ran a campaign from Uther all the way through the fall of Camelot and another one around the grail quest (in the first campaign the player knights were all too practical to engage in such silliness).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important thing to know about Pendragon is never to use a published adventure as written.  The published adventures all suffer from the usual rail road and not understanding the rules of the game problem in a big way.  Use the plot hooks scattered throughout the books, but the actual adventures need to be hacked for ideas not run as written.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you run published Pendragon adventures they will tell such stupid things as "Make a Lust check to see if you're seduced by the maiden".  This is absolutely NOT how the rules are supposed to work (its actually a violation of the rules in the rule book, particularly the earlier editions before the sim heads got ahold of it and blurred the line).  The virtues and vices are meant to record your behavior not dictate your behavior.  Only above a score of 16+ (where you start earning glory for your traits) can the GM call for a roll to force you to act a certain way (and the Glory reward is there to compensate you for that).  Below 16, you just earn checks for your choices...so if you allow yourself to be seduced, check Lust, if you refuse check Chaste.  We used the same multiple check hack here as we did for skill advances.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329613/#Comment_329613" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T09:26:41+00:00" title="June 14, 2011  9:26AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            CK -- Other than the whiff factor (which Valamir touches on re: skills) my players really enjoy it.

(But this clearly says something about<i>me</i>.)<br/><br/>How much pleasure is gained from being that specific Knight with those specific Traits and Passions for the Players?</br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nI can't speak for Luke, but I can give my impression. Trait bumps, Passion bumps and Skill bumps are a very big deal.<br/><br/>First, as BW players, we're conditioned to forgive a lot of hardship and heartache on our characters' parts for the sake of advancement. We're happy to jump into a horrendous situation with both feet, knowing full well that something awful is likely to happen to our character, if there's a test toward advancement as a reward. In the face of that, the random nature of advancement is very jarring. And pretty unpleasant from the player perspective, from what I can see.<br/><br/>Within the context of the game itself, remember that the quest for Glory is the fuel for the entire game. You seek Glory to become a legend to rival Balin, Gawaine, Lancelot, etc. And to get that Glory, you need high traits and high passions. You need to succeed -- or better yet crit -- on important skill rolls in important situations. You need to defeat dangerous enemies. And let's face it, you need to survive long enough to have an heir that can succeed you. And that requires performing heroically in battle so you can win rewards from your liege and plunder so you can live superlatively to give yourself a better chance of having children every year and to give your children a (still pretty lousy) chance of surviving to the point where you don't have to make survival rolls for them every year. And to perform heroically in battle on anything approaching a regular basis, you need passions and combat skills rated at 20 or higher.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329657/#Comment_329657" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-14T11:29:46+00:00" title="June 14, 2011 11:29AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Can you nail down any specifics?

From there we veered way, way off course within a framework of Vortigern's rise to power. We really loved and hated the rules, as Thor also noted, and for similar reasons. The game can be stupidly lethal. We needed a flowchart for combat. The whiff factor can be high. But man, passions are great, the setting is just wonderful, it was just pure fun. We rotated GMs from week to week and just had a good time with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329890/#Comment_329890" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T08:33:19+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  8:33AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2011 8:42AM by Luke_Wheel.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thor has noted most of my feelings with the game. <br/><br/>I would like to note that despite my emotional response to the vagaries of the events of game play, I am in awe of the design. It is a thoroughly, brilliantly designed piece of work. Greg Stafford's stamp as designer is clearly present. I love this part of it. It makes me want to play it precisely as written. Any sort of hack or modification raises my hackles! <br/><br/>There are certain design choices that I find baffling and unfulfilling, but I'm committed to playing the game as it is.<br/><br/>I do confess that I have trouble motivating to take action during play on occasion.

It helps to understand the game as a big tapestry on which individual PCs are pictured. This one goes down to a Saxon, that one becomes a Knight of the Round Table, that one conquers lands in Ireland etc. You will never get to the end of <i>The Boy King</i> playing in this mode, let alone the GPC, but it works very well for me. Players can come and go, using the Winter Phase to update their chrs if necessary. Embrace the randomness. One PC covered himself with Glory at Badon, and the next week got splattered by a giant with a club. One PC never did anything but the Winter Phase and became immensely Glorious.<br/><br/>PDis certainly a strange game if you want to see it that way. I credit PD with making me broad-minded about possibilities and hence, later, open to the flood of indie games. I don't think it's Glory that's at the heart of the game, I think it's the sense of being guided into a different world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330125/#Comment_330125" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T19:42:02+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  7:42PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>I don't think it's Glory that's at the heart of the game, I think it's the sense of being guided into a different world.</blockquote>\nThis, I think, is crucial.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330131/#Comment_330131" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T20:49:05+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  8:49PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I vehemently disagree.

There's a certain amount of giving oneself over to the fiction because when the GM initiates a trait* challenge process, the roll is going to dictate character action over that of player desire.<br/><br/>It's one of the reasons why I love Pendragon's approach; it's a game that dictates a certain type of fiction because the PCs are roles interacting with the fiction in a very tone-dictated manner.  The players can still do what they want and have a wide narrative operating status but the system prevents them from going off-reservation.<br/><br/>Now that I write that out, it sounds a lot like a Fate game full of hard Aspect compels as conducted by a GM who has a fiction-verisimilitude agenda. And god-damn if I'm not happy with that.<br/><br/>*meant trait, not trail -- clearly I can't spell today.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330241/#Comment_330241" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T12:00:30+00:00" title="June 16, 2011 12:00PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How hard would Pendragon be to PbF/PbeM?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330244/#Comment_330244" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T12:08:34+00:00" title="June 16, 2011 12:08PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2011 1:38PM by Valamir.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">The pill folks have to swallow before they swim in the river of Pendragon is that having high value Traits and Passions is fucking meaningful.

First 16 is the threshold.  At 16 the GM can make you roll your Lust and if you fail you're going to bone the faerie sorceress even though you just KNOW that's not going to end well.  But at 15...no.  No roll, no requirement.  There's ALOT of published KAP scenarios that violate this rule because the author just didn't get it.  Ignore that, its crap.<br/>\n<br/>\nKey number 2 is that you literally CAN'T be forced to take traits that high (except maybe by the basic intro starting character rules...that may tell you to take one at 16, I forget because we never just went with the basic character creation).  If you find yourself at 15 and don't want to go to 16, just start making choices in the opposite direction and you'll soon find yourself dropped to 14 and out of "harms" way.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the automatic Glory you get for high traits and the magical powerz you get for having different combinations of high traits is pretty sweet.

But for KAP the fun is seeing the changes wrought in the world as the time line progresses from the anarchy post Uther's death to the rise of the boy king, the establishment of the hegemony of Camelot, the complete texture shift to the high middle ages and the grail quest, and then the agony of the collapse.  And while you're doing that you're building a dynasty.  Having a son in Pendragon means nothing.  Having a son finally survive to reach age 21 after all of your other children have died just as you've gotten so old you can barely lift a sword and need to retire...THAT's powerful stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it doesn't have to take that long.  Each adventure is a year followed by a winter phase that is essentially a mini game in itself.  If you play snappy, keep to genre appropriate adventures (and don't overly sandbox it) you could conceivably get through two years in a single decent length session.  10 sessons could conceiveably have you get through 15-20 years of play, if you stay focused and don't dilly dally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330292/#Comment_330292" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T15:50:00+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  3:50PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2011 3:51PM by David_Berg.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All that sounds great, but I got the sense that with the BRP whiff factor it was far from guaranteed.

We played off of the Boy King.  Its basically arranged year by year as a timeline of "historical" events in the King Arthur story, where he was, what battles were fought, high level goings on.  Each year includes several "rumors you hear at court" (stuff like "hey that new French knight is showing a great deal of promise" or "I wonder what the king will do about X")  There's usually a number of plot hooks, some details on a key event or two that players could get sucked into (like fighting at the battle of such and such, or competing in the tourney at Glastonbury which featured these famous round table knights.  Its interspersed with a gazeteer of places and cool little mini adventures that could happen there...like nasty "oh shit" moments like encountering "Black Annis" or being there when some donkey kicks some famous dude down a well.  The nature of the events and tone they're presented in really give flavor to the different phases.  Each phase steps through a different period in history...so in phase one the castles and armor and methods of fighting are very 6th century, by phase 5 (like 100 years later) the castles and armor and tournament pagaentry are very 13th/14th century...which all fades back to historical norms with the fall of Camelot.<br/><br/>Glory's cool and all, there's a mini level up feature at different Glory thresholds IIRC.  Its primary use is establishing a pecking order among knights.  Your starting Knight will have 1000+ Glory (cuz he's a knight) maybe a little more depending on your father and such.  Unobtainable King Arthur level is like 100,000, with most of the famous knights being in the 10-30K range IIRC (I think Lancelot was 80K in his peak version).  You'll get glory from defeating baddies, a nice bit (10% of their glory I think) for besting a knight in a tournament.  You get automatic glory for having strong virtues and passions (but that's like 16-100 points a year for scale purposes).  I think also for maintaining yourself in lavish fashion.  If you survive one of the big battles (like Arthur vs the 5 kings in the north) you can get beau coup glory all at once so there's a certain motivation to engage in such things.<br/><br/>I find the game really takes off in the second generation of characters.  Sons inherit a portion of their father's glory, stats, and reputation, which means the next 21 year old has a big head start over the first one.  But its a lot of fun to watch them develop differently in the different Phase.  Dad was a brusque somewhat barbaric warrior who took no prisoners and smashed people who crossed him with a big sword.  Son like to sing love songs and recite poetry and prefers tourneys to muddy battle fields...lots of fun which son encounters Dad's old friends (and Dad's old reputations).  We had a couple of players get to third generation characters just in time to participate in the end times.  It was interesting to see how that generation of new characters in our game hated and despised the second generation characters who were still in play...blaming them for letting it all go to shit.<br/><br/>As GM watching some players accumulate more glory, get granted lands and titles while other players fell behind due to character death or what not, and the fairly wide disparity in ability / wealth between the second generation characters of those whose father's were more successful / famous and those whose fathers were less so was really enjoyable...not sure how enjoyable it was for the players...there was definitely some inter player rivalry between the haves and the have notes...my rose colored nostalgia glasses may be glossing over some player disatisfaction there.  But I definitely thought that added depth to the game.<br/><br/>There's lots of solutions to the BRP whiff factor.  Ours was to bump every skill up by 5 points at the start and then use multiple checks to ensure that they actually went up from use reliably.  We also toyed with rolling 3d20 and keeping the median result as a way of introducing a bell curve but wound up ditching that.  The real solution to the BRP whiff factor is to make ample use of Inpiration (I think that's what its called)...basically make a check against a passion to power up your skill check before making a roll (like Riddle of Steel Spiritual Attributes) at the risk of falling into Melancholy if you fail to be inspired.  If you've got a skill of 5 and no passion to power it up with...that's pretty much the game telling you "WTF".  So it worked out in the end once we learned to game it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330296/#Comment_330296" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T16:21:46+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  4:21PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did you have many people going insane from fumbled Passion rolls?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330315/#Comment_330315" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T17:44:23+00:00" title="June 16, 2011  5:44PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The GPC is essentially the same thing as The Boy King except it goes from 485 (under Uther) to 566 (the wrap-up after Camlann).<br/><br/>Uther (485-495), Anarchy (496-509), Boy King (510-518), Conquest Period (519-530), Romance Period (531-539), Tournament Period (540-553), Grail Quest Period (554-557), Twilight Period (558-566).<br/><br/>The technology updates each period.

There's plenty of room to improvise and weave in your own stuff, as well as material that you can weave in whenever it's appropriate.<br/><br/>You can only earn a maximum of 100 Glory per year from your lands, so that doesn't really help you.

As per the table in the GPC, we roll on the table every six months of game time to see what has happened to the knight. In every case so far, the knight has returned to his senses within the six month period. <br/><br/>The players were pretty nonplussed the first time it happened, but were much more accepting of it when they realized that knights always receive a number of experience checks based on what they were engaged with in their period of madness. One knight even spent his time wondering the Camlann Woods spouting prophecies of the coming of Arthur.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
