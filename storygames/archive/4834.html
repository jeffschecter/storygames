I was really excited to scratch the fantasy gaming itch I've been developing up here in the icy depths of Hokkaido, and I was looking forward to showing off some story-game goodness to Rob. <br/><br/>But what to play?  We looked at TSoY, but decided that the really juicy parts of that game wouldn't be revealed in a one-shot game (which was all we had time for).  I'd recently found Jason Morningstar's "Dungeon Squad", and was an admirer of its simplicity and elegance, but I really wanted to show off a more player-empowered style of gaming.  "Donjon" seemed the perfect game for us.  We looked over the rules, and while I think it's pretty much perfect as a recreation of D&amp;D as a player-empowered story-game, it seems to carry a lot of rules baggage from that genre emulation that we didn't really need.  What I wanted was the elegance and simplicity of Dungeon Squad, with the neato player power of Donjon.  And maybe Keys from TSoY as well.<br/><br/>So I did it myself!<br/><br/>Twenty minutes of hammering away at a text file gave me the bare bones of a system.  I kept "Warrior" "Wizard" and "Explorer" from Dungeon Squad, but used the other two slots for more freeform, player-defined traits.  d20s were used as a kind of rudimentary "Key": Acting in accordance with your d20 trait nets you rerolls, like bennies from Savage Worlds.  Acting against the trait lets you roll an extra d20 to resolve the conflict.  Winning conflicts lets you narrate facts about your success, or get bonuses to future rolls.  <br/><br/>Rob seemed unsure of it.  I think he's not used to the kind of roleplaying you do at the drop of a hat, using some cobbled-together system.  "Let's test it" I said.  "One scene, and if it's no fun, we'll drop it."  He agreed to make a character, and soon "Maximum Barbarian Man" was born.  My entire prep for the scene consisted of writing "The smell of cooking meat coming from a cave" on a piece of paper.  In five minutes, we were ready to go.<br/><br/>And we had a blast! Maximum Barbarian Man met another plains-hunter in the cave, and they quickly made friends over a seared gazelle haunch.  None too soon! The heap of rocks collapsed, and the two barely escaped.  The rockslide revealed an ancient subterranian structure, a temple to the dark gods of the long-dead giants.  Adventure ensued.<br/><br/>I forget now which parts were created by me, and which by Rob, but I was really surprised how we were able to build a compelling, unique fantasy setting, out of improvised facts from successful rolls, and the consequences of lost conflicts.  There were a few hiccups as I worked out how to frame the conflicts right, and when to cut to new scenes.  I think I've learnt a lot from "The Mountain Witch" about how to create exciting conflicts, and how to create room for player-narrated success.  I think that the way the game (inspired by Donjon), metes out discrete "facts" to the players, rather than giving them free reign, really encourages creativity, rather than stifling it.  When you've got a limited amount to create, it's really easy to come up with a single exciting thing, while having carte blanche to create interesting narration can be very intimidating.  I really like improvising and thinking on my feet as a GM, but it was really nice to be able to call for a perception based conflict like "Do you see what's in the cave before it sees you", and then give the floor to Rob to narrate his success, describing what he saw in the cave.  What was really surprising to me was that, within an hour of play, we'd created a very satisfying and complete swords-and-sorcery style story.<br/><br/>I was so jazzed with the success of the game, that the next night, when my friend Ben came to visit, the three of us (Rob, Ben and I) sat down to play again.  And it rocked just as much!  So much, in fact, that we played two seperate stories end-to-end without a break.  Having two players really enriched the experience, without slowing things down noticably.  The highlight of the second night for me was the climax of the second story. Ben's character, with "Obedient" as his d20 trait, was confronted by an ancient evil giantess/lich.  She ordered him to drop his protective talisman.  He opted instead to smash her face in with it.  Because he was disobeying an order, and hence going against his trait, he got to roll an extra d20 for the conflict.  The lich never stood a chance.  He rolled a 19 to her seven.  <br/><br/>And now the part where this post becomes "Directed Promotion", rather than Actual Play:  Over the last week I've cobbled together a pdf of the game, codifying a lot of the rules I improvised in play, and writing down some advice on how to play the game. I've just put it up for download <a href="http://www.rpgbakery.com/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=23" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  It's free, fun, and easy to play.

I like that it makes the boundary between scenes really clear.  My only concern is that the game as it stands has a slightly adversarial relationship between players and the GM, and framing scenes is a big part of that.  It's like "Ha HA, deal with THIS!".  Framing your own scene, then playing through it, would change that a bit.  On the other hand, it might just mean that the challenge goes both ways: "Ok GM, what can you do with THIS?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113047/#Comment_113047" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-08T16:39:28+00:00" title="December  8, 2007  4:39PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>To blow my own trumpet, you could replace the attributes from Savage Donjon Squad (or Donjon itself) with a standard D&amp;D character, and achieve a pretty playable game. </blockquote>\nI've been thinking about this.<br/><br/>Defined a character like this: STR/DEX/CON/INT/WIS/CHA modifiers like d20, and Level.
