Or even more specific, like "every PC is a member of the occult crimes task force" or "every PC is dealing with grief issues related to the war that just ended." <br/><br/>I find that these games tend to run smoother and be more satisfying for me as GM, but I also worry about stifling some players who aren't actually interested in the strong theme. The advantage is you don't have to rope together wildly differing characters and goals, but that can be a source of creativity as well.And sometimes people play in one themed campaign and feel like it's too constraining after a while.<br/><br/>Any tips, or best practices, for making this work for everyone?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466263/#Comment_466263" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-14T22:02:35+00:00" title="September 14, 2017 10:02PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's actually the amount of specific theme I like a published game to have, as opposed to just the individual campaign of it.

Anything you would like to change or add? etc.<br/><br/>And then take the <b>Apocalypse World</b> approach to PLAY TO FIND OUT ... so that anything the PCs do is still good for you. You offered a clear and focused starting point, but nothing more.<br/><br/>The problems you fear usually arise if the initial canned pitch turns out to be the entrance of a tunnel <img alt=":neutral:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/neutral.png" title=":neutral:"/> <br/>If you also have a pre-planned story you want to deliver, or you expect the initial setup to endure untouched throughout the game, then yes, you ARE constraining them and some Players may notice and take issue.<br/><br/>Beside what the GM does, a problem I sometimes see happen is with Players that initially say YES to an idea, then do something completely different and dissonant in actual play, but are CONVINCED to still be adhering to the agreed upon idea.<br/>I remember specifically a Prime Time Adventure session when, during the setup, a Player specifically asked for the game to be "<i>dark, serious, psychological, somewhat inspired to the Dexter* tv series</i>" and then went on creating and playing a PC that was a complete clown.<br/>The GM let it happen because it was a demo and because maybe the Player had an angle... he hadn't. When half through the session we made a pause and asked him about such behaviour he completely fell from the sky: "<i>Oh, right, I did not even notice</i>" :P<br/><br/>*Dexter the serial killer, not the young mad scientist <img alt=":dizzy:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/dizzy.png" title=":dizzy:"/> <br/><br/>To fix this just have a constant and friendly open dialogue. If you notice something off, just ask about it. Often you get to see things the Player's way, or they stir better their play. Or you find a genuine problem, and can now act to fix it, usually by re-negotiating what SEEMED ok but now obviously is not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466269/#Comment_466269" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-15T12:23:47+00:00" title="September 15, 2017 12:23PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is all my home group does, and we either choose a heavily-themed game everyone is excited about or have a conversation and adjust until everyone is really excited to play.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466275/#Comment_466275" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-15T14:57:43+00:00" title="September 15, 2017  2:57PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just thought of a good metaphor for this: the Suicide Squad movie, if it were an RPG campaign.<br/>One player created an emotionally scarred hit man motivated by love of his daughter.

Lost chance, I guess.<br/>That movie is a sin against humanity, but for totally different reasons, if you ask me :P<br/><br/>Following your metaphor, is SS was an rpg adventure one problem I see is with Captain Boomerang. He has nothing to do with the others. He wants out. He DOES walk away.<br/>A well handled game would allow him to do just that, and then split the focus between the "<i>team on a mission</i>" and the "<i>loner minding his own story line</i>".<br/>Instead there character is forced to stay within the adventure's rails... and next scene he is still in the group, because reasons.<br/><br/>Same with your example.<br/>A well handled game should allow (maybe even encourage) conflict between Deadshot and Queen. Because she's crazy and will SURELY jeopardise DShot's chances to see again his daughter... which could lead to all sorts of interesting tensions and confrontations.<br/>Maybe they demonstrate something to each other and get square.<br/>Maybe they kill each other.<br/>Maybe they break the team into competing factions.<br/><br/>This is golded material.<br/>And in 99% of the cases is much more interesting to the Players that ANY story the GM can possibly come up with.<br/>Not because it is inherently better (it usually is not, personal drama at an rpg table is usually on the level of a badly written soap) ... but because of a subtle and powerful <b>storygame ninja trick</b>: if YOU make it, of it MATTERS to you, if you LIVE it in first person... it's simply more engaging and interesting than anything else coming from "outside".<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466277/#Comment_466277" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-15T15:40:07+00:00" title="September 15, 2017  3:40PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To follow up on that last thought.<br/><br/>This is why having disjointed PCs can work IF the game (and or the GM) support <b>weave play</b>.<br/>(the name comes from the Solar System rpg, and I'm pretty sure to have spelled it wrong T_T)<br/><br/>You have a bunch of PCs.<br/>Each one has nothing to do with the others.<br/>Each one has completely different goals.<br/>Each one lives and acts in a completely different part of the world.<br/>They might never meet.<br/>And still the "campaign" can result incredibly tight and coherent and fun if you (by system or by direction) have all Players subscribing to the game's themes and then apply aggressive framing, relatively fast rhythm; beneficial but not necessary is SOME kind of connection between PCs (even if they are unaware, but the Players are).<br/><br/>On the other hand establishing a compact starting point is no guarantee of success if the rest of the game is not properly supported and maintained.<br/><br/>Which game are you using, or intending to use?<br/>Which techniques and approach do you use after the ball is kicked with the "thematic start"?<br/>What kind of problems do you usually face?

This one ensures they go after something they actually find interesting. Most probably it would be either linked to their character's background, the setting they made or other activity they find engaging.<br/><br/>I often end up using the first session on this, some travel scenes and maybe a random encounter so players get familiar with the system and their characters. This gives me until the next session to properly prepare for whatever they asked. Afterwards I can prepare based on the consequences of their actions or have them make up some more rumours. And if you can or want to improvise, that's good too.<br/><br/>In this fashion I've been able to make diverse characters fit the setting, have the players engaged with the idea from the start and make interesting plot hooks by their own.<br/><br/>However a friend of mine just found out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy0RNOiQxu8" rel="nofollow">this video</a> and I'm definitely planning to include player advice on avoiding to make these types of characters.
