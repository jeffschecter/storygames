Any ideas?<br/><br/>Any other suggestions?<br/><br/><b>Quarantine vs Public</b><br/>We usually quarantine playtesters. That is, get separate feedback from each group so that they don't "contaminate" each other, and provide independent feedback. Constructive negative feedback is especially useful. We sometimes ask for GMs to get their feedback from the players without talking about their own views first. We do get some peculiar but very useful results this way. For example, two groups of players for Esoterrorists expressed an issue with being railroaded, and these were in the two games where the GMs had been wildly improvising in response to unexpected PC actions. So, in this case, it was a perception issue which needed to be addressed in the text. Quaranitine, I think, also works better for experienced game designers with a definite vision who present a fairly polished and almost complete text which has been playtested in house. It's also possible to ruthlessly disregard comments such as "other, less experienced groups might find this" when you have other, less experienced groups. <br/><br/>Public playtests have the side-benefit of marketing, and sometimes interaction between playtesters can generate useful feedback, but it's not something we've tried that much. I've seen games basically developed in public through an interaction between the game designer, other designers and players, but (with some exceptions) I think suits the creator/publisher designer better, where the creator is not considering their interaction as time-consuming work, but an enjoyable and essential part of the process.<br/><br/>Recently, I've been trying a half-way approach, that is playtesters should post their actual play on blogs, but avoid looking at other testers' experiences. This seemed to work for MCB.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193901/#Comment_193901" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-24T09:53:55+00:00" title="February 24, 2009  9:53AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2009 10:02AM by Graham.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, are you after general ideas about playtesting, or specific stuff about where to post?<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2184&amp;page=1#Item_32" rel="nofollow">Playtesting better</a><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=72&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">Playtesting effectively</a><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1259&amp;page=1#Item_9" rel="nofollow">[Playtesting] What's most important?</a><br/><br/>And there's a few more: do a search for "Playtesting".<br/><br/>Generally, I think the idea of calling for playtesters, on forums, is overrated. Most of the playtesting I've seen is more social. I talk to Jason in the afternoon at GenCon, and he says, "I'd like to playtest Medical Hospital later", so I make time in the evening. Or I say to Scott "Are you doing anything in the evening at Concrete Cow? Could we test A Taste For Murder"? And we do.<br/><br/>I imagine you could do something similar, perhaps addressing the masses who assemble outside the electronically locked gates of Pelgrane Towers through the intercom, and ordering them to playtest something.<br/><br/>I like the idea of playtesters posting on blogs.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193917/#Comment_193917" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-24T10:46:28+00:00" title="February 24, 2009 10:46AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2009 10:48AM by Simon_Rogers.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the links and the feedback.<br/><br/>Specifically where to post is really what I'm after.
