                    For some reason lately I've been interested in older RPGs, partly because some of them have neat stuff, and partly because some of them have some really whacked-out ideas, especially from when they were new and people were just trying different genres out to see if they would work. There also seems to have been a persistent drive to support every game with published scenarios.<br/><br/>I had to do an inter-library loan, but I was able to borrow a copy of Lawrence Shick's book, "Heroic Worlds," which lists off just about every RPG and supplement every published from the inception of the hobby to about 1991. So, here's some of the ones I found particularly interesting. Some are definitely candidates for awesomeification, and some are concepts that can be found in newer RPGs, indie or otherwise.<br/><br/><b>Masters of the Universe:</b> Yes, <i>that</i> Masters of the Universe. According to Shick it's a board game with simple RPG elements.<br/><br/><b>Heroes of Olympus:</b> The PCs are Argonauts in ancient Greece.<br/><br/><b>Valley of the Pharaohs:</b> Palladium did a fantasy RPG set in ancient Egypt, which didn't use the Palladium system at all, back in 1983. They actually put <a href="http://www.palladium-megaverse.com/cuttingroom/valley/valley.html" rel="nofollow">PDFs on their website for free</a>!<br/><br/><b>Dinky Dungeons:</b> So named because the book was 3"x4". And true to the times, they still put out six scenarios for it.<br/><br/><b>Dragon Warriors:</b> A fantasy RPG notably mainly for the rules being published in the form of four mass-market paperbacks.<br/><br/><b>Heaven and Hell:</b> A "generic fantasy" (for D&amp;D but not published by TSR) book detailing the biblical heaven and hell in game terms.<br/><br/><b>Monsters! Monsters!:</b> I actually played this once at a con; Flying Buffalo basically look the T&amp;T rules and made a game where you play as the monsters and prey on adventurers and civilized humans.<br/><br/><b>Spawn of Fashan:</b> A legendarily, hilariously bad fantasy RPG published by "The Games of Fashan" in 1981. It has monsters called "finikor" and "rolmtrokl."<br/><br/><b>Swordbearer:</b> A fantasy game. You gain social status, and since the game has no money, you get the equipment you need automatically as your social status rises (but you can lose it for acting out of character).<br/><br/><b>Uuraah!:</b> A 12-page caveman RPG from 1976.<br/><br/><b>Woof Meow:</b> A game where the PCs are real-world cats and dogs, but with magic rules.<br/><br/><b>Bulwinkle &amp; Rocky:</b> TSR did a very, very simple RPG based on the cartoon. It has lots of materials, including some hand puppets made of thin plastic (which have no bearing on the game) and uses spinners instead of dice. <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/BULLWINKLE-ROCKY-ROLE-PLAYING-GAME-1988-TSR-NM_W0QQitemZ260027662998QQihZ016QQcategoryZ1183QQrdZ1QQssPageNameZWD1VQQcmdZViewItem" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is an ebay listing with pictures.<br/><br/><b>Dallas:</b> From the soap opera/crime drama of the same name. "As much a card game as a role-playing game, it was widely loathed by SPI's devoted following of wargamers."<br/><br/><b>Lords of Creation:</b> PCs are epic heroes who can move across time, space, and parallel universes.<br/><br/><b>Confederate Rangers:</b> This one is <b>amazing</b>:<br/><i>"Near future SF system set in an America where the government is so corrupt that 13 southern states secede and form a new Confederacy. The Heroes are the Confederate Rangers, high-tech lawmen with old-time values."</i><br/><br/><b>Cyborg Commando:</b> There's a great <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/10/10214.phtml" rel="nofollow">review of it on RPG.net</a>, but basically it's a terrible game about cyborgs fighting invading alien insects by shooting lasers out of their fingers.<br/><br/><b>Simian Combat:</b> Planet of the Apes with the serial numbers filed off. Gamescience was going to re-release it as "Gorilla Wars." Compare to <a href="http://edenstudios.net/primate/" rel="nofollow">Terra Primate</a>.                </div>

What do you want to know- I loved that clunky sucker.<br/><br/>I mean, ultimately the goal is for your character to become the GM. How wonky is that?                        </div>

                            Swordbearer was pretty cool, I thought.  Somehow I lost my copy of it, but it had an interesting magic system where you collected nodes of power similar in retrospect to Ars Magica's much later pawns of vis.  (I wonder if it was an influence, incidentally.)  Nodes were either of the 7 elements (fire, metal, crystal, water, wood, wind, light/darkness), or the 4 spiritual humors (vitriolic, phlegmatic, choleric, melancholy).  <br/><br/>As I recall, the elements had a particular order and you could gain utility from them by having a sequence of nodes (i.e. fire + metal + crystal) rather than just a bunch of one kind.  <br/><br/>It had status rather than money.  It also had "Circles" of skills rather than classes.  i.e. You picked a primary Circle which was a grouping of skills.                        </div>

I have the game and the supplements. And Dallas. And Cyborg Commando. (I once had Dragon Warriors and Valley of the Pharaohs as well). Dallas actually has some very neat ideas, and would probably have gotten a <i>completely</i> different reception if it had been published now.                        </div>

                            Hi Andy,<br/>
<br/>
I used to play Lords of Creation. As far as I know it was the first multi-genre roleplaying game. At least I don't remember any others when I was playing it in 1984 or 85. I haven't read it in quite a while but it's in my closet with the other games. I may remember inaccurately. It was a level based game, you gained xp, and as you gained level you would gain titles and special powers, the last level was a Lord of Creation which allowed you to make your own pocket dimension. Hmm... I'm going to get more data so I can visit reminiscion lane. Maybe more later.                        </div>

                            Wow, I had totally forgotten about Cyborg Commando. My childhood friend had a copy of it. I think it's what triggered a revulsion for all things cyborgian (the way the metal and skin comes together. Blarf). Despite my disgust, I'd still like to leaf through the book to get squicked out all over again.                        </div>

                            Lords of Creation was predated slightly by "Worlds of Wonder" -- which was the boxed set including the Basic Role-playing booklet along with three different setting books: Magic World, Future World, and Super World.  Thus it was clearly the predecessor of GURPS.  Speaking of which, that was another weird old game.  <br/><br/>Superworld was re-made later and was pretty generic superhero stuff, and as I recall Magic World was also pretty similar to other fantasy settings.  But Future World's premise was that gate technology meant that interplanetery/interstellar craft were unneccessary -- just simply ground-to-orbit shuttles.  It also interestingly had an integral part of combat being your battle computer with ECM and ECCM (i.e. electronic counter-measures and counter-counter-measures).                        </div>

                            At the risk of being stoned to death, Heroes of Olympus was only marginally an rpg, it was mostly a boardgame with rpg elements.<br/><br/>Swordbearer a lot of people think was already awesome and unfairly neglected.<br/><br/>But Lords of Creation definitely deserves awesomeification, as does Man, Myth and Magic by Yaquinto which was a crap game with a great concept.  You played incarnations of characters, and in one party could have an aztec priest, druid and gladiator who if they died would reincarnate as new protagonists.<br/><br/>I played in a Lords of Creation campaign, it was in a way kind of cool because eventually you gained narrative control over the universe you were part of, but in game knew you had that control.  Like a lot of those old games, it played with some radical concepts without apparently ever being aware it was doing so.<br/><br/>Similarly for example, Gangbusters abolished the concept of the party and had the idea of PCs who might not know each other and who might actually be working against each other, but seemed to have no awareness quite how radical an idea that was (and indeed, still is).                        </div>

Yeah, I remember the example of play where half the PC's are lawmen and half the PC's are bootleggers, and the example ends just as they're shooting at each other with tommyguns.  I always wondered what happened after that.                        </div>

                            Chivalry and Sorcery first edition (in teeny-weeny 6 point font). I defy somebody to create a character who can cast a spell, and then have them cast said spell. I'm pretty sure we never really had the mechanics correct.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you remember to calculate your Knight's Courtly Romance Factor. Make sure you have a spreadsheet handy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How about Max's favorite, Privateers &amp; Gentlemen. This one is phenomenal for the fact that it's like Traveller on steroids in terms of how you can play out your character's life by charts. Really more of a simulation of the life of Hornblower-esque characters than roleplaying.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
KABAL (Knights and Berzerkers and Legerdemain). Notable for being the game that everyone is thinking of when they mention that game that requires a calculator to play in combat - because it does. You know how to make your calculator do fractional root problems, right? Not sure if it's actually more mathematically complex than Phoenix Command, where I once did 421 points of damage with a sniper rifle at 400 meters distance, penetrating both the character's skull, and the plywood wall behind it (no, I'm not sure why the GM had to calculate if it went through that wall after it had killed the target, but I can only assume it had something to do with him knowing the trajectory and that there may have been something important behind the round - I never found out).<br/>
<br/>
What's fascinating about both KABAL and Phoenix Command is that the folks who ran these games at cons actually made them work by doing all of the calculations for you very rapidly. The games were actually pretty entertaining. Particularly the monster Centarhino named Fluffy that roamed the halls killing entire parties with single backhand blows (hobbits were often spared, due to being too short to be included in the sweep).<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neko Ewen</cite><b>Dallas:</b>From the soap opera/crime drama of the same name. "As much a card game as a role-playing game, it was widely loathed by SPI's devoted following of wargamers."</blockquote>
Back in 1980 or so, I was a kid at Dragonflight.  It was the first or second Dragonflight, so I was 12 or 13.<br><br>I'm sitting in the lobby of Campion Tower when the convention director Chuck Monson comes out with a large cardboard box.  "Who wants a free game?!?"  He shouts.  People leap up, hands in the air.  Chuck reaches into the box, pulls out a boxed game and flings it across the lobby.  Someone catches it as Chuck flings another.  And another.  And another.<br><br>Then the shouts of dismay.  "Dallas?!?  The Roleplaying Game?!?"  Suddenly boxed games are flying in BOTH directions, convention-goers desperately trying to close pandora's box.  But no, Chuck won't take 'em back.  It seems someone donated three cases of this game to Dragonflight.<br><br>Dragonflight has an auction every year.  Several copies of Dallas appeared that year.  The next year a few more.  Over the years it has dwindled until - for many years - there was only one copy.  It was the same copy, annually donated to the convention, auctioned off, and returned the following year.<br><br>The game didn't come back a couple of years ago.  But last year, some noble soul found a copy on ebay, bought it, and donated it to Dragonflight again.<br><br>To my knowledge, no-one has ever played the game.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Wow. Just wow.<br/><br/>My trip out to the used bookstore didn't help me with the textbook I needed, but it did yield a copy of Rick Swan's <i>The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games</i>. The fact that he gave Cyborg Commando 3.5/4 stars makes his reviews a bit suspect, but he does review about 150 or so games, so I have some more:<br/><br/><b>Deepsleep:</b> You play yourselves, visiting a research facility, when WW III breaks out. You go into suspended animation tubes, and the game is about the adventures you have in dreams.<br/><br/><b>Expendables:</b> PCs are expendable people hired by megacorporations to explore potentially dangerous new planets. For no apparently reason, it includes skills for Basketweaving, Blacksmithing, and Proctology.<br/><br/><b>Justifiers:</b> Genetically engineered furries must work for exploitative an megacorporation as it profits from new planets, and can eventually earn enough money to buy their own freedom.<br/><br/><b>Morpheus:</b> Characters are players at a "dream park" having virtual adventures, and can use their imaginations to alter themselves or the world around them. Attributes are Imagination, Confidence, Ego, and Reputation.<br/><br/><b>The Morrow Project:</b> A serious game about people who were recruited for cryogenic freezing so they could survive an oncoming nuclear holocaust. The game opens as they wake up to a ruined and radioactive world.<br/><br/><b>The Price of Freedom:</b> PCs are average Americans trying to form a resistance against a Soviet occupation of America. By Greg Costikyan.<br/><br/><b>Reich Star:</b> Nazis in space! The Reich and the Empire of Nippon have become rival interplanetary powers, and it's up to freedom fighters (like the PCs) to struggle to stop their tyranny.<br/><br/><b>Star Ace:</b> When everyone was big on Traveller, someone did a zany B-movie sci-fi type game with swashbuckling adventures and green bug-eyed space monsters.<br/><br/><b>Twerps:</b> Anyone else remember Gamescience's "The World's Easiest Role-Playing System"? Which had one stat (Strength) and a hex grid and was sold in a plastic bag?                        </div>

Anyone care to explain what yiffing is, and what Andy is talking about here?<br/><br/>I get "furry" and anthropomorphic gaming, but everything else is beyond me.                        </div>

Most fun game ever.  Despite the presence of hyperintelligent bipedal polar bears, I wouldn't go so far as to call the game Zany.  It did have quite a space opera (the genre, not the game) feel.  One of my all time faves, just for the fun and attitude.  I'll run it!                        </div>

I remember <b>Stuper Powers</b> being innovative, but don't remember why. Does Rick Swan's <i>The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games</i> mention it?<br/>

I also used to play the heck out of a game called <b>Space Infantry</b>. It was an 5.5" x 8.5" book and I remember liking it more than <b>Star Frontiers</b>, but I don't remember why.                        </div>

                            From what I've heard the furry fandom has... issues. The RPG hobby can get contentious and annoying at times, but apparently it could be much, much worse.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bryan</cite>I remember <strong>Stuper Powers</strong> being innovative, but don't remember why. Does Rick Swan's<em>The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games</em>mention it?</blockquote>
No, but then Swan's book (or at least the first edition I picked up) was published in 1990, and I think Stuper Powers was more recent. <a href="http://wingnutgames.com/SPD.html" rel="nofollow">Wingnut Games</a> has a website and everything. I remember flipping through Stuper Powers at the FLGS like a year or so ago, and seeing powers like Mate And Produce Offspring With Electric Appliances, Entangling Armpit Hair, and Induce Vietnam Flashbacks.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Do such pro-Christian games still exist? Do companies still publish them?</blockquote>
Well the first thing that came up in Google was <a href="http://www.dragonraid.net/" rel="nofollow">Dragonraid.net</a>, which has info, tons of support links, and lets you order the game online. I don't know that anyone else has tried to create anything like it, but it evidently has something a fan base.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tadk</cite>The Confederate Rangers sounds pretty ok too<br>Precursor to Firefly</br></blockquote>
I was thinking more like a high-tech setting for Dogs in the Vineyard, thereby adding important moral questions the original creators might never have conceived of.                        </div>

                            Ah, the Morrow Project - I played the <i>hell </i>out of that.  My brother and I helped playtest it.  We share a copy of the 100-copy pre-first edition.  A few loyalists still play it, and the <a href="http://www.timelineltd.com/" rel="nofollow">company is still in business</a>.  Cool things about The Morrow Project:<br><br>1.  Weapons have an E-factor, which is how you calculate damage.  E-Factor is penetration, in inches of white pine, which is an actual (now outdated) ballistic measurement.  A .223 assault rifle has an E-Factor of 15 or so.  <br><br/>2.  You play private soldiers, cryogenically frozen, whose job is to rebuild America after a nuclear war that your boss, time-traveling billionaire industrialist Bruce Edward Morrow, knows is coming.  But!  250 years accidentally pass, instead of a mere five!  Punk Roooooock!<br/><br/>3.  Characters have blood points.  You bleed out and die.  Plus you also roll for blood type.<br/><br/>4.  HAAM suits - Hydraulically Assisted Armored Man.  (I'm throwing the goat right now)<br/><br/>5.  Crazy post-apocalypse villains like the Warriors of Krell and the Frozen Chosen that you must do battle with.<br/><br/>6.  Campaign prep includes targeting major cities and runways over 5000 feet with SS-18's and rolling for MIRV dispersion patterns, bomb yields, and so forth.  You destroy America before play.                        </br></br></br></div>

                            Do Morrow Project and Justifiers and such count as weird? I mean, if those are weird, then there's a ton more that can be thrown in. Uh, basically everything. I mean Gamma World is way weirder than Morrow Project (or it's contemporary, Aftermath!). And Metamorphosis Alpha (to Omega) is an order or magnitude wierder than that. And these are TSR games.<br/>
<br/>
Is Star Ace any wierder than Star Frontiers? Are all the virtual world games any weirder than Dream Park?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, what's a "normal" old RPG? Like... what are you supposed to do in Boot Hill? Kill Indians, right? Or Bandits. Or be the bandits, and rob banks. Or be the goodguys, but end up robbing banks, because the game doesn't say what else it is that you're supposed to do. How wierd is that?<br/>

The local game group here has a PBP game of Justifiers going on the message boards. <br/>I had a ton of fun taking a large map of the US, using the correct yields for the Nukes the USSR had at that time, and drawing in the circles on the US Map based on the strikes, and the extra ones the first pages of the rule book said you could use.

Brilliant game in terms of it's ideas and inspiration.  Gate led to other worlds in our galaxy, but also to alternate dimensions where you could find alternate histories.  Truly horrible system.  I ran a short game of this using mechanics from Pacesetter's Timemaster (Same basic system as the old Chill), which at the time was one of my favorite systems.<br/><br/>I still have this book and love to look at it for ideas.                        </div>

I don't know if we are.  The Dallas I have (and the only one I've seen) is clearly marked as a role-playing game.<br/><br/>I kid you not, in all these years I have never so much as read the back of the box.                        </div>

                            From the writeup on The Way:<br/><br/>"The three adventures provided in The Way book deal mostly with moral issues. The students will face a series of difficult decisions, in which their values and moral qualities are put to the test. There is rarely any solution that is obviously correct. It is easy to find issues that illustrate most of the Ten Commandments and the love of God and your fellow man. The game world contains both heroes and villains. The adventures deal particularly with conflicts between good and devoted individuals and a world that â€“ at least most of the time â€“ is characterised by secular indifference and utilitarianism."<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard, anyone?<br/><br/>I particularly like that the game is intended to be played by confirmation classes - i.e. it's part of a rite of passage to adulthood. I think The Princes' Kingdom and DiTV would be ideal rite-of-passage games.                        </div>

                            Space Quest from Tyr Gamemakers Ltd. is about the only game that I know that uses a d30.  The game was created in the midst of the look-and-feel software lawsuits, and the rumor was that the choice of the d30 was to avoid any possible challenges by TSR.  It was the equivalent of D&amp;D in space with rules for creating solar systems (based upon Bode's Law) and an alien race classification scheme that was reminiscent of James White's Sector General novels.  I've often been tempted to convert it to another rules set (say D20 Future or True20).                        </div>

                            Dallas: The Television Role-Playing Game<br/><br/>Turns out there isn't even anything *to* read on the back of the box.  It's blank.  The front cover has a picture of J.R. with his big shit-eating grin, and proclaims "All the drama and power, the wheeling and dealing, the loves and the lives of tv's greatest family are yours to enact in this fun-filled, fast-playing game."<br/><br/>Inside, you get two d6 dice, a rule book, a book of Major Characters (with convenient pull-out pages), A Scriptwriter's Guide and 56 Character Cards, in non-handy perforated, tear-it-yourself cardstock, each representing some minor character or plot device.<br/><br/>It turns out, Dallas is not really a role-playing game.  Or, perhaps more appropos for this place, it isn't a Story Game.  It's more like a combination of a strategy game and one of those mystery party games.  There are three "scenarios", each of which has a specific premise and goal for each of the nine Major Characters.  Players do take on the roles of one of the nine Major Characters, and do get to actually role-play them, but play is very structured and each scenario has very specific win conditions.  And yes, there is a "winner" in this game.<br/><br/>The game is very structured, with each scenario having several Scenes.  In each scene play proceeds in three Phases.  <br/>In the Director Phase, the Director sets the scene.  He explains the premise, passes out Character Cards, gives out secrets and special knowledge players may possess.  <br/>In the Negotiation Phase, players interact (in character), talking, trading cards, etc.  This is very freeform; there are no limits on what players are allowed to discuss, trade, etc.  But it's all voluntary in this phase.  <br/>Last is the Conflict Phase, where players try to win information or plot devices from other players through the use of Persuasion, Seduction (opposite gender only, kids), Coercion or Investigation.  Each character has preset score to perform and resist these four abilities.  Each player state a goal ("I want J.R. to tell me about his secret meeting with those government men.") and how they'll do it ("I'll find out by threatening to expose his plans to his mama.").  The Director can assign other special abilities as the scenario demands, which can be used in similar ways.<br/><br/>Play proceeds through all of the scenes of a scenario.  At the end of the last scene, players determine if they've met their victory conditions.  Any player meeting his victory conditions wins.  If more than one wins, there's a tally system to determine who wins the most.  Some victory conditions are mutually exclusive.  If two characters are supposed to get the Land Deed, only one can win.  If no-one has met their goal, the episode ends in heartache.  Or something.<br/><br/>The Scriptwriter's Guide has info to help a Director explain the rules, and to create his own scenarios, complete with his own minor characters and plot devices.<br/><br/>I've played a few SPI games in my day (Yay, Planetkiller!).  This reads very much like one of those, and not at all like a real RPG.  My eyes hurt, now.                        </div>

                            I bought Cyborg Commando at the dolar store when I was in Highschool.  By E. Gary Frickin' Gygax IIRC.  Completely unplayable.<br/>To the assembled masses:  <br/>I am troubled because I cannot remeber the name of this weird old game.  I purchased a game back in probably 1993, maybe earlier that made use of a custom d16 (numbered 1-1-1-1-1-1-2-2-2-2-4-4-8-16-C-TM).  The game was destroyed in what has become known in my family as the "Piss and Sheep incedent", but I've still got the d16 in my dice bag.  It was an oddball to be sure, it seemed to be written by a computer programmer with a never-articulated obsession with balance at every moment of play.                        </div>

This sounds like one of those Remember When stories: "We didn't know how to read the d4" or "We didn't know what the white crayon in the bag of dice was for".<br/>

The Western, in all its incarnations, was a well-understood genre.  Not just on film, but on TV. Was there -really- a significant gap in the info provided?

I mean-- I didn't really 'get' Gangbusters when I was a kid.  But that's because the era of the gangster movie was before my time.<br/>

Truly 'weird old games' might be those whose genre truly had no previous media reference.                        </div>

<p>That's not really Mike's point, is it? Mike's asking why games like The Morrow Project are considered "weird" when they're about as clichÃ© as westerns. He's asking "If games based on one set of clichÃ©s (The Morrow Project) are 'weird' and games based on another (Boot Hill) aren't, what's the difference? What makes them so weird?"</p>
<p>He's not asking "what do you do in a western?"</p>

And old friend of mine said you only need to know three things to play Boot Hill:<br><br>"Yup."<br>"Nope."<br>"Draw."

I only meant that in giving examples, some of the individuals responding may have chosen to emphasize the "old" over the "weird," and that this offered a possible explanation for why some of the examples did not seem "weird."  I wasn't trying to imply that any of the choices were somehow less valid than any other, only that different folks applied the criteria differently in their replies than the OP had when he OP'ed.<br><br>I wish I still had/could remember the name of a game I bought in 1989 or 1990.  I bought it - of all places - at a shareware store (a store where you could by copies of shareware software).  It was the first ever electronic format RPG I'd seen.  It was on a 5Â¼" floppy disk, in ASCII text.  I bought it for a few bucks and in true shareware form the author asked all readers who liked the game to 'register' it by sending him money.<br><br>IIRC, the premise was similar to Riverworld:  "Everyone who has ever lived wakes up in a new world.  Deal with it."                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<br/>
Back in the day, my college gaming club had a copy of the Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle rpg.  The puppets were like those thin plastic ones that Burger King used to have.  Whenever we were struggling to pick a game for the evening, I would threaten to pull out Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle.  Then one Friday night, after the weekly rpg sessions wound down and the late night rounds of HeroQuest (the old GW board game, not the rpg) drew to a close, we decided to try it out.  We opened the box...and I blacked out shortly thereafter.<br/>
<br/>
Reich Star sounds similar to a game I ran a while back.  The setting was basically World War II in space, with corporate analogs of the US, England, France, Germany, and Japan competing for different planetary systems.  We used White Wolf's Storyteller system as a base mechanic.  Fun was had by all.                        </div>

I'd proudly say I stole it if I did.  Sadly, not only have I never seen the Dallas RPG, I've never even seen Dallas, the television program.  Or Dallas, the city.  I did make a connection in the Dallas airport once, though.                        </div>

                            Some late comments on already-mentioned games:<br><br>DragonRaid: Yes, it's a tool for discipling (or, from my POV, proselytizing--yes, i know there's technically a difference, but i don't accept that it's meaningful). Yes, it's still available from the new owners of the IP, and they're working on a new, more-mechanically-modern edition. It's actually a steal, from a raw bang-for-your-buck standpoint: it's a big boxed set, packed full of stuff, for only $25. It's also a pretty poor game, mechanically speaking, being basically D&amp;D-esque (and, of course, i mean AD&amp;D1, not even AD&amp;D2). It's also a fairly poor example of the faith, managing to highlight, rather than gloss over, some of the inherent contradictions, and outright violate some of the major tenets, IMHO. (I dunno, maybe "Thou Shallt Not Kill" has a silent "humans" at the end of it, and giants don't count.) Plus, like the worst examples of proselytization, it falls back on heavy-handedness, with simple, one-correct-answer situations, rather than providing interesting moral dilemmas for consideration. Given my hatred of proseltyzing, i'm not sure the fact that it is a poor tool for the same makes the game more or less offensive to me. <br/><br/>[All that said, i have nothing against championing a belief system, and trying to persuade others to live buy it. It's sneaking it up on people that bugs me, trying to do so with people who've made it clear their minds aren't open to be changed (or "enlightened"), and/or indoctrinating kids without letting them know that there are other options. I don't think DragonRaid is in the least bit guilty of the first--it's explicitly aimed at teaching already-Christians--but it seems to be guilty of the last. And, like i said, as a tool for demonstrating good Christian values, it kinda gets muddled.]<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure the weird-d16 game was Metascape.<br/><br/>Gangster movies in the recent past: i can only think of one, the Bruce Willis movie, um, Last Man Standing? I suppose that one with Tom Hanks qualifies, too. But while there've been tons of modern (for the time the movie was released) or recent-historical mobster movies, there've been hardly any movies set in the '20s and '30s. I suppose you could count Dick Tracy, too, if you really wanted.<br/><br/>TWERPS is still mostly available from GameScience. I bought the core rules and a whole bunch of setting supplements a couple GenCons ago at his booth. He apparently still has crates of the stuff at his warehouse.<br/><br/>I found Dragon Warriors available as a digital download on a website a few months back. It claimed to be a legitimate scan, made available by the IP-holders, but i don't actually know for certain. <br/><br/>Oh, and on the Christian RPG front, i believe Spiritual Warfare is also in the same subgenre of RPG, though i haven't looked at it super closely. I remember being turned off by the mechanics, moreso than the subject matter. I actually *really want* to find a *good* Christin RPG, just in case i ever find myself in the position of needing to intro someone to RPGs who is a conservative/evangelical/reactionary/whatever-you-want-to-call-it Christian. (Sorta the same reason i have Know Your Role--it could be the perfect intro RPG for somebody, even if i have approximately zero interest in the subject matter.)                        </br></br></div>

                            Psychosis: Ship of Fools<br/>
<br/>
From the mid 90's, this book is a single scenario with a tailored system provided (kinda like Mountain Witch if you will).  The system is tarot card based.  The characters are the cryogenically frozen pilots of an enormous generation starship, who were improperly revived and are dying and hallucinating as they die.  Only the players aren't supposed to know this.  Instead, there is a system the GM uses for tracking the current "theme" of each players hallucinations, and how close they are to breaking through to reality.  At stress points, a player may shift deeper into psychosis or come closer to reality.  When they do this, the "theme" changes, so to the players,  one minute they are starship troopers fighting monster bugs, and then the next they are in 17th century France.  The goal is for the characters to find their way back to reality long enough to initiate the braking sequence before the ship (and all its millions of lives) plunges into the destination star.<br/>
<br/>
When I bought this and read it, I thought "oh how cool" and "nobody I know will EVER play this with me".<br/>
<br/>
That second statement is no longer true.  I'm gonna have to dig this one out some day.                        </div>

                            I tried GMing Psychosis when it first came out. (They were supposed to publish a follow-up, but it never happened). It was hell - you have to keep track of what psychosis each player is in, what items/clues they've acquired, how these items/clues appear to them etc. In addition, you sometimes have to translate between them if they ever enter the same location (while having different psychoses). Mostly, the players just wandered around not knowing what to do and never interacting.<br/>
<br/>
One way to make it work better would be to let the players _know_ about the plot, and what psychoses the characters were in. That way, they could join in on describing how for example the blaster pistol would act in a "lost world" psychosis.                        </div>

The topic of bizzare old RPGs never gets old for me. I love collecting the weird shit from the ages.<br><br>Lets keep the list going, and talk about some of the old stuff. I haven't seen some of the OSR people even talk about some of the stuff on this list before.<br><br><b>High Fantasy:</b>I've had a copy of this for years. It seems to have a small following of people who occasionally remember it exists, but have never actually played it. It's a fantasy RPG that isn't super original, but has lots of kinda neat little details. You have both a class and a sub-class, and both give you special abilities. It has lots of cool possibilities like being an alchemist with an old-school handmade gun, and a Martial Arts subclass that for some reason means your can be a wizard proficient in an entirely fictitious martial art. It's slightly gonzo, and that's a lot of the fun. The game is actually well thought out, and seems to be one of the earliest RPG texts I can find that actively talks about 'story' as the main point of the game.<br>The highlight of the game is three really awesome sand-boxy adventures from the first of two supplements. One in a castle, one in a forgotten underground city populated by people who think the world has ended, and one that TAKES PLACE ON THE CORPSE OF A DEAD GOD (or maybe giant, I think it's a god though). Part of the dungeon is THE GOD'S GIANT WINEGLASS, which is so large you can walk around inside the decorative carving. I'm totally stealing that for Dungeon World someday at the very least.<br><br/>WHERE ARE THEY NOW: <a href="http://www.dragonraid.net/home" rel="nofollow">Dragonraid</a> still appears to be being sold. And has the kind of hyper linear adventure that White Wolf supposedly (but didn't actually) overboard with. Except it is supposed to teach you about god or something. Because god likes railroads?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Justifiers is published again in germany. Fantasy author Markus Heitz did buy the rights and worked on it. I never even knew it was an old game but thought it was some Furry thing he made up. As far as I know he modified it enough to call himself the "father" of the system.<br/>Not sure how it changed from the old version too and I will not buy it to look. But yeah, still out here.                        </div>

<b>Heroes of Olympus:</b>  This is really not an RPG as much as it is a bunch of mini-boardwargames that cover different parts of the Voyage of the Argo.  There are different characters, and they have stats, but the stats only influence how well you can complete the minigames.  It's rather like Runebound in that respect.  As game design goes, it's excellent - my favourite element of the game is the "navigating the Argo down a river without beaching or holing it" minigame, which somehow manages to be fun and suspenseful.<br/><br/>Most of the other stuff on that Iist I own has already been reviewed.  I will trawl my bookcase tonight for more retro goodness.                        </div>

<b>The Whispering Vault</b>: You play characters that used to be human, but have since been inducted into the order of Stalkers--supernatural beings empowered by otherworldly deities to hunt down the Unbidden: rebel gods who have escaped from the dream into the Realm of Flesh, which is reality as we know it.<br/><br/>You have all kinds of powers, the most interesting of which is that you are unlinked from time and space. Your fellow Stalkers could be from the distant past or the far future, and you could have Hunts (what they call chasing down Unbidden) in any time period as well. You could be in the Theatre of Pompeii watching Caesar get cut down one session and on the UNS Harvester in deep orbit above Mars the next. You play characters that can shoot flaming skulls from their eyes or summon little spirits that harm and hinder.<br/><br/>It was discussed heavily on the Forge, I think, so maybe everyone has heard of this game.

Oh yeah, I played this for a bit in college.  Pretty original game, scenarios were all over the place in a good way.  The books are definitely worth checking out, but I recall the rules are nothing special.  If I were to play it again I'd just use Nobilis... especially since Nobilis actually already has a very similar cosmology and premise!<br/><br/>I should dig out my copies...                        </div>

                            Jorune and Pacesetter's Sandman always struck me as a little weird.  I can see Empire of the Petal Throne being on the list as well.<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>

                            The settings were far from the traditional games of the day.  While I enjoyed reading them, I can honestly say that there wasn't anything that resembled a player base.  At least EotPT has some fans.<br/> </div>

                            I'm surprised no one mentioned:<br/><br/>Khaotic - a soft sci-fi RPG where you play a team of agents and psychic who are able to possess a monstrous body to explore another dimension. Yes, all the players get their own characters, but they must share control of the body.<br/><br/>Lost Souls - a spiritual predecessor of both Wraith and Dead Inside, you play a newly deceased (with random tables based on who you were in life) who becomes a ghost/undead and must help people in order to avoid being reincarnated as a slug. <br/><br/>And both of these (among others) still live at Joe Williams' <a>Haunted Attic</a>.                        </div>
