Several games in this contest point towards a creatively simple wish to have the game tell you what to say so that you can then say it, but it's not the only place where I'm encountering this sort of thing: I've been reading some Nordic design lately, and I'm seeing similar inclinations in the work of eg. our own Matthijs Holter - the pleasure of playing the game is simply in the most basic ability of the group to narrate together, with no further ambition to it.</blockquote>\nI see what it looks like. In games like Society of Dreamers and Love in the Time of Sei\xf0, the rules don't really say anything about, well, creating bangs, asking tough questions, challenging character beliefs, etc. None of the trappings of narrativist design.<br/><br/>However, when I play the games, you betcha that the players are making thematic choices for the characters. In LiToS, it's baked into the situation, of course; but even in Archipelago, this happens. Whether it's from player expectations or emergent stuff, we see characters facing personal choices - how important is power? what will you sacrifice to get it? In SoD, it seems like no character ever leaves the game without facing the question <i>who are you? what do you want from life?</i> Perhaps it's just part of the human condition.<br/><br/>As I've talked about elsewhere, these days I'm all about iterative game design. This is especially the case with SoD. I design, playtest, change everything, playtest, put in new stuff, take back old stuff again, playtest, rewrite from scratch... etc. This means that I see that the game works, but I can't tell you exactly why. There's emergence; I make players do X and Y and Z in a specific order, and for some reason that makes them do \xc6 and \xd8 and sometimes \xc5. <br/><br/>The best analogy I can think of is a simple pedagogical technique which goes like this: If the teacher lets the students into the classroom in whatever order and state they want, the lesson will start in chaos, which can affect the whole lesson, and there will be little learning. However, if the teacher makes the students form a line every day, and only lets them in once they're silent, the lesson will be very different. It's not because of a focus on learning, or content; it's a simple ritual with surprisingly strong effects. (Similar to a pater familias making the family pray before dinner: That minute of silent contemplation affects family interactions and atmosphere for the whole meal).<br/><br/>So what am I trying to say? I'm saying that to get to your goal, you don't necessarily aim for it and take the straight and obvious path. Sometimes you get what you want as a random and unintended by-product of an unrelated set of techniques.<br/><br/>You don't see narrativism in my design, usually. That doesn't mean my games don't produce narrativist play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280587/#Comment_280587" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T07:29:44+00:00" title="July 14, 2010  7:29AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I may be mis-remebering, but at one point wasn't there some discussion regarding narrativist play and designing for it that revolved around a Vanilla Narr vs. Some other kind of Narr approach?<br/><br/>From what I recall, the less taken up approach didn't so much involve directing Narr style trappings that have become common to Narr design so much as chopping out things that tended to interfere with Narr play.<br/><br/>Universalis is probably the poster child for this less-taken approach.

Points of contact refers to the amount of interaction with the rules required to make play go (not to be confused, however, with "rules light" vs. "rules heavy").<br/><br/>See also: <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/_articles/glossary.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://indie-rpgs.com/_articles/glossary.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280601/#Comment_280601" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-14T08:36:44+00:00" title="July 14, 2010  8:36AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2010 8:37AM by Tim C Koppang.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>That sounds a bit like the school of thought that says "I don't care what system we use, as long as it doesn't get in the way of our role-playing".</blockquote>\nNot at all.

For instance, Society of Dreamers, which I did already read, seems like it doesn't actually do anything, but the topic is totally one where I couldn't imagine making a game that didn't do anything, if you understand what I mean - if Matthijs says that the game's actually intended to be dramatic and even narrativist, I'll believe that I'm not seeing it simply because I read it in the wrong framework.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_280781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280781/#Comment_280781" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-15T00:54:04+00:00" title="July 15, 2010 12:54AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It could be that the text of SoD isn't complete*. But I think differing frameworks and expectations is a key here. Norwegian game designer Kaare, who's more of a Forge narrativist than I am, said "It's one thing to be uncompromising is one thing, but it's another thing to sit in an empty room and call it minimalism". I think he saw the same... emptiness? that Eero describes. <br/><br/>* Although it does seem to produce the sort of play I aim for even across different gaming cultures - as in this <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12480" rel="nofollow">Polish actual play</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_280845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/280845/#Comment_280845" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-15T08:12:10+00:00" title="July 15, 2010  8:12AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I see what it looks like. In games like Society of Dreamers and Love in the Time of Sei\xf0, the rules don't really say anything about, well, creating bangs, asking tough questions, challenging character beliefs, etc. None of the trappings of narrativist design.</blockquote>\nA way I think of these differences are games that use structure and those that use mechanical procedures.  Mechanics are "hard", they line up to numbers and ritual actions (ie rolling dice etc), or hard coded narrative chunks: like writing down a story goal, best interest or belief.  Structure is more open--it's a story that you play out, like the touching events in Happy Ends or the sci-fi spin on the Christ story in the Last Supper storytelling larp. Or that should probably apply to more traditional but also very open things like (non-mechanical) character concept, setting and situation.  And also, you're going to have both of these: I know Archipelago has mechanics, as does Happy Ends (blowing a whistle when things get too sad), etc.<br/><br/>Matthijs, when the juicy stuff starts happening in Archipelago, where does it come from? You said it naturally emerges from play, so when you look at the play and play stuff that it spins off from, what are its sources? From the natural trajectory of the characters pursuing their lives within the context of their setting? From the interactions between the characters? From the mischief wrought by the GM?

This isn't an explicit part of the game, but people tend to make or choose settings with big conflicts (i. e. wars) nonetheless.<br/>- Character design: Motivations. Connection to major conflicts. We've sometimes used R-maps, which, again, isn't an explicit part of the game.<br/>- Game mechanics that encourage - even require - players to mess with each other: Using phrases like "that might not be so easy", narrating NPCs actions at odds with the characters' motivations, and (in LiToS) theme guides controlling parts of characters &amp; event guides choosing semi-scripted events.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
