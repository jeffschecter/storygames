I wouldn't expect any two given people to agree on what it means.<br/><br/>For instance, in my circles "fiction first" may or may not mean "the narrative is more important than the mechanics", depending on what 'the narrative' means and what kind of mechanics we're using.<br/><br/>I interpret is as something vaguely like this:<br/><br/>Rules-first: it's the mechanical or procedural parts of the game which create fictional content.<br/><br/>Fiction-first: the established fictional content we're imagining comes first, and the rules or procedures come into play when that fictional content demands or triggers them.<br/><br/>It's not a strict line, because, depending on the particulars, they can blend into each other or merge in weird ways. These aren't precise or technical terms at all; just a short-hand between friends.<br/><br/>For instance, most "narrative-heavy games" or "storytelling games" are "rules-first" in this view.<br/><br/>This old post by Vincent Baker might be a really useful one to read on this topic (although it doesn't address those terms or use them):<br/><br/><a href="http://www.lumpley.com/archive/156.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lumpley.com/archive/156.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_472190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/472190/#Comment_472190" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-17T21:01:39+00:00" title="April 17, 2018  9:01PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find "fiction first" an extremely useful shorthand.

This is how I think about it:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://i.imgur.com/CWgUKbQ.png"/><br/><br/>I think there are two revealing questions:<br/><br/>1. What triggers the use of a mechanical procedure?<br/><br/>2. To what extent is conversational, non-quantified state the authoritative description and influence over what happens next?<br/><br/>In the first sequence, which is fiction first, the authoritative 'state' of the game (what's really happening is chiefly conversational.  Somebody notices that the situation warrants a mechanical procedure (say, a move 'triggers' based on somebody's intention).<br/><br/>Quantified state may be used (e.g. your +HOT), and modified (take 2-harm) by the mechanic, but the fictional outcome is also important. (e.g. the procedure might tell the GM to come up with a hard bargain, and they do so)<br/><br/>The second sequence is a like a board game (e.g. Mordheim), or Conflict in Mouse Guard. The quantified state (e.g. whose turn it is, following a turn sequence) tells us what procedure to use ("You" choose an action from a list). The resolution procedure primarily updates quantities.<br/><br/>The changes to quantities get described, (e.g. you rake the troll with your magic claws!) but that description is not authoritative.. potentially even irrelevant. It doesn't matter where the troll was raked in terms of the application of later procedures or quantities. It's just a description of the quantitative change, but the quantity (eg. the troll has 12 hit points left) is authoritative and sufficient state to play the rest of the game.<br/><br/>These are just two patterns, there are a bunch of others (e.g. updating a quantity because the conversational state warrants it\u2014for instance, you say you 'rest for a long time', so you put your hit points back to maximum).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473014/#Comment_473014" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-29T23:48:37+00:00" title="April 29, 2018 11:48PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PbtA games are <i>not</i> fiction-first through and through.

If I've taken "Sprained Ankle" as a Consequence, that's something that's true for as long as I have the consequence.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473024/#Comment_473024" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-04-30T13:29:45+00:00" title="April 30, 2018  1:29PM">April 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">@Fuseboy</a> <br/><br/>That is a SOLID analysis.

I think Upstart's point isn't that <i>invoking the rules</i> is meaningless, it's that <i>wrapping that invocation in description</i> can sometimes feel a little bit tough or dry.<br/><br/>This is what I personally think, too, when I think about adding some teeth to an IIEE protocol. If I need to know exactly <i>how</i> you're doing what you're doing -- in order to even find out what happens -- or if <i>what</i> you're doing is enough.<br/><br/>In our game this Saturday one PC had been tied up by the two other PCs and by their two NPC retainers. And they were like "OK and then we head on home" and I was like "But <b>how</b> are you doing that? Are you carrying him and if so, what gear do you leave behind? Are you forcing him to walk and if so, how?" It was a difficult situation to DM because I didn't mean the sarcastorhetorical "and how are you doing that?" of something impossible. I meant it straight-forwardly, like "tell me how you're solving this problem, because it is a problem".<br/><br/>And their entire routine of catching rainwater, foraging for food etc etc would've been disrupted by having a hostile PC who they had tied up. His tent-mate had been eaten by a dinosaur so now who was sleeping in who's tent? Etc etc. To me that was super interesting and we had one player who kind of wanted to handwave it and I was like "But we need to know this in order to know what happens." To me, the details was what was interesting. After all my posturing about how in Paul's ice moon story you could've condensed those four hours of frustration into a couple of minutes of rolls, here, I really wanted to know. I wanted to find out how their new routine, under this circumstance where one PC had turned against the others, played out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473429/#Comment_473429" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-07T11:17:43+00:00" title="May  7, 2018 11:17AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2018 11:21AM by Krippler.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Swedish parody game <b>Playelf</b> (which happens to be the first written game I actually tried to run) had the mechanic, which I'm not sure was part of the satire, that you would get more dice for a better description. You rolled 1, 2 or 3 dice + skill level depending on how intricate your narration was. As a 12 year old I thought this was clever, not I think it's complete bullshit and the opposite of good design.<br/><br/>Narration should, in my not so humble opinion, have <i>utility</i> in the story. In the Playelf rules text they use a lockpicking attempt as the example for the three different die levels of description, 1 die = "I pick the lock", 3 dice = four paragraphs of inane patter with a few details like where your character keeps their lockpicks. Most likely "I pick the lock" will have more narrative utility because it's faster and you can get more game time in. Other works of fiction are edited to cut out the superfluous parts and are rightly criticized when they don't. The difficulty with roleplaying games is that it's a collaborate and real time process of both authoring and editing the ficiton, it's possible to undo something in real time but you will never get that time back.<br/><br/>The reason why you need to narrate your actions <i>fiction first</i> in Apocalypse World is because it is up to the MC whether the action constitutes a move that needs a roll at all. There is no move to determine whether shooting someone works, narrating that you pull your pistol and shoot someone will have different mechanical results based on what is actually going on. If you shoot someone who is sleeping the MC will likely determine that they are done for, if you try to assassinate someone who might concievably get out of the way Go Aggro is the most likely result.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473430/#Comment_473430" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-07T11:24:24+00:00" title="May  7, 2018 11:24AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2018 11:24AM by 2097.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wushu has a similar mechanic to Playelf.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Krippler" rel="nofollow">Krippler</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The reason why you need to narrate your actions <i>fiction first</i> in Apocalypse World is because it is up to the MC whether the action constitutes a move that needs a roll at all.</p></div></blockquote>\nYes, this is the teeth.

The MC doesn't have to judge at all.

How amusing.<br/><br/>I like Vincent's take on it; AW (and many of Vincent's other games) carefully place the responsibility to use the rules to their best effect in the group's hands, instead of delineating a precise and step-by-step procedure. This is a fairly interesting thing, design-wise. I think it provides a lot of flexibility and a sense of shared authorship. In exchange, though, a lot of people apply other approaches or familiar dynamics to the games (e.g. "the GM is the one who decides when we roll the dice!"), which sometimes leads to awkward internet fights!<br/><br/>Sandra,<br/><br/>Your mention of the Ice Moon Story is quite relevant here; like you say, in the case of the campsite, getting into that kind of detail was totally relevant and fruitful, in a way it wasn't on the Ice Moon. <br/><br/>Gamers seem forever to get fixated on familiar procedures and forget the actual goals, objects, or agendae of the activity they're participating in. If we remember that it's not the "describe in detail" which is important, but using that approach at the right times to make our game better, then things get a lot easier, I find. Sometimes it's easy to forget that, however.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473579/#Comment_473579" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-08T21:06:45+00:00" title="May  8, 2018  9:06PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Though I find stuff like the lockpicking narration really fun even, tbh, because then you get to make it all pretty and nice and interesting instead of just being the formless mechanical blob that it is before you start narrating it.

We're bringing something to life, and enjoying each other's skill at doing so, entertaining each other in turn.</div></blockquote>Sounds like rules first procedure-wise and possibly fiction first priority-wise.

(A tasty cake? A pleasant view? A sorrowful scene?)<br/><b>Action:</b><br/>- The image/moment sticks with you; or<br/>- You get lost in that mood.</blockquote>\nand that can be applied to any number of situations with that sort of thing happening. From exultant joy to sorrow and anything and everything in between, depending on what the situation in which you're using it is. <br/>And like, that's for me some of the ideal kinds of mechanics, where you have this thing that means something but that means something vague, but in the moment it takes on incredible meaning. Like for instance we had a scene in our session earlier tonight where my character took a Slice-of-Life action when she ended up in this confused emotional muddle after an Excrucian made her question her worldview, and she got caught up in that mood and it persisted through the next couple of scenes my character was in.<br/>And then later in the same session, the other PC took a Slice-of-Life action when she got really excited about a new project she had an idea for and then couldn't get the idea out of her head.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473879/#Comment_473879" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-13T12:04:30+00:00" title="May 13, 2018 12:04PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2018 12:14PM by DeReel.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The question here seems to be the size of the funnel leading to the mechanical part. <br/>Fiction dependent comes in two sorts : fiction in (usually player input), fiction out (usually, an outcome).

Often that's my favorite stuff!  Often enough, my group can see what I'm excited about, and roll with that.<br/><br/>Not always, though.<br/><br/>Sometimes, the other players at the table don't notice, or they don't get why I'm excited, for various reasons.  At that point, it's on me to get them to care.<br/><br/>Sometimes it's nice when the game design does that job, showing everyone why they should care.  Rules which connect a certain chunk of narrated fiction to certain relevant fictional developments are quite helpful in this regard.<br/><br/>I guess "others don't care" isn't <i>literally</i> perfunctory, but, y'know, the narrated fiction doesn't wind up mattering the way the player wishes it did.  Same idea, IMO.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I do think it's underwhelming when the narrated fiction seems that it ought to influence relevant fictional developments, and then the rules say that it doesn't.  "Rules which adjust the fiction without first reading the fiction at a certain level of detail" -- that's a nice example of a potential downside of "rules first" play IMO.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Upstart">@Upstart</a> by "fiction-independent", I meant rules that don't factor in whatever fictional thing it is that we wish mattered.

My group and I have been playing mostly PbtAs and FitD games and we've gotten used to the easy exchange between players leading with fiction and leading with a mechanic.  "I'm gonna deep brain scan him" and "I put the violation glove on his forward and try to look inside his head" have both felt like fair player leads.  In a lot of these cases, they are holding the dice and double-checking their 'Weird'.<br/><br/>However, we have been playing Torchbearer and 'fiction first' play on the player's side is hard-coded into the rules.  In Torchbearer (Unlike AW) the GM exclusively determines when the fiction triggers a mechanic.  Also, the player-generated fictional positioning has a huge impact on mechanics.  If players describe a way around a challenge, then they don't roll to overcome it.  (Like the neat diplomacy with bribes and connections examples above).<br/><br/>This has caused a couple problems, however.  A few times, players have said "I sneak past him" then picked up the dice and double-checked their scout, ready to roll.  I kind of hate to say 'no, don't do that', but I also don't want them to bury themselves under failed rolls when there are other solutions at hand.  In these cases it feels like fictional positioning is an important tool they aren't using.<br/><br/>The other time mechanics-first play has collided with fiction-first system is when players say something like "I look for medical supplies to treat X's exhaustion.  Scavenger roll, right?"  I say "Uh, yeah, it would be."  So they roll and succeed. I say: "Cool, you have one inventory of medicinal herbs from the yard."  And they say, "Oh, I thought I was looking around inside for blankets and stuff."  In this instance, I can reiterate that players tell me what they are doing and I call for a roll (or not, there are weeds in the yard and blankets on the floor, it seems likely not to be a test at all).  But after the fact it can feel like policing other people's playstyle.<br/><br/>I would have called our playstyle 'fiction first' before, but I think we're all trying to change mindsets to a system where the mechanics present you with interesting problems but the fiction is a key tool to solve them.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473982/#Comment_473982" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-16T01:21:46+00:00" title="May 16, 2018  1:21AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2018 1:22AM by David_Berg.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/moconnor">@moconnor</a> I think saying "I roll Scout" and "I roll Scavenger" are extremely natural behaviors when those options exist.  I think the only way to significantly reduce that behavior in your Torchbearer game is to ruthlessly outlaw it.  And I think ruthlessly outlawing it will only work socially if y'all agree on a reason for it.<br/><br/>Sounds to me like that's probably unnecessary.  A few minor glitches over how someone was scavenging etc. doesn't sound like a big deal.<br/><br/>If you did want to try it, though, I'd do two things:<br/><br/>1) Promise them really earnestly that you're not going to deny them useful rolls.  They may <i>succeed</i> without rolling, but they're not going to <i>fail</i> without getting a chance to roll.  You'll also call for rolls reasonably quickly -- they won't have to spin their wheels because you want them to "earn" a roll with more/better roleplay/narration.  And then, once you've told them all that, adhere to it.  (If they do something that'd clearly fail, just tell them, "I can't think of what you'd roll here," so they know you're still trying to give them rolls whenever possible.)<br/><br/>2) Pitch whatever excites you about "only the GM names and calls for rolls".  Maybe it's a type of problem-solving, maybe it's the style of narration and conversation, maybe it's immersion... whatever you see as the appeal.  (Example: For me, I feel like the fiction becomes more vivid, tangible, and meaningful, when everyone must always interact with it directly.  If you can't refer to a mechanic, and must always say what you do, I find that fosters a heightened sense of engagement with and attention to the imagined environment.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473983/#Comment_473983" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-16T01:59:31+00:00" title="May 16, 2018  1:59AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2018 2:01AM by Stephen P.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh.

But the "succeed without a roll" rule for fictional positioning is definitely a fiction-first enabling rule.<br/><br/>For me, a strength of Torchbearer is exactly that its mechanics demand to be engaged first, but that they then create strong emergent theme.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473984/#Comment_473984" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-16T05:24:24+00:00" title="May 16, 2018  5:24AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>1) Promise them really earnestly that you're not going to deny them useful rolls.

I agree that the mechanics demand to be engaged, but I think that they demand to be <i>cleverly</i> engaged.  The "good idea" rule (succeed without a roll) is one example but I think twists and conditions are another.  If a player is sneaking past an orc, they roll scout and the orc rolls nature.  Say the player fails, now the orc has them cornered and they have to fight or flee.  On the other hand, say a player describes the halfling sneaking along a raised platform the GM had mentioned.  They still roll scout vs. nature, but when they fail, the twist might be very different.  Instead of cornered by the orc, the orc is clambering up the cave wall after them.  Both are twists, as they present new obstacles for the player (cornered by orc/fleeing from orc,) but the latter gives them a lot more flexibility in the actions they describe next.<br/><br/>Additionally, skilled players will know that a scout test is coming when they describe sneaking around something, but they may also describe smart approaches that would count as "supplies" for the test.  Do they rub guano on their cloak before sneaking through a nest of giant bats?  Do they criss-cross a stream when fleeing bandits?  These things should grant them an extra die for "supplies/ right tools" at the very least.  You can do this with conflicts, too.  Building a barricade before the enemy is upon you might get you +1 success on each defend action once the conflict starts.<br/><br/>So I think you're always engaging with the mechanics, but limiting yourself to the stuff on your sheet might cause you to miss the advantages you can gain in-fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474003/#Comment_474003" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-17T02:22:36+00:00" title="May 17, 2018  2:22AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2018 2:24AM by Stephen P.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/moconnor" rel="nofollow">moconnor</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p> Additionally, skilled players will know that a scout test is coming when they describe sneaking around something, but they may also describe smart approaches that would count as "supplies" for the test.

But I'd be inclined to describe exactly that dynamic as mechanics-first thinking: "I really need to pass this Scout test, so I need some advantage dice. Where can I get them? Maybe some bat guano?" Literally, mechanical rules push the players into the fiction.<br/><br/>Compare that with an imagined fictional reason. Like, "We heard that the Duke collects exotic animals, so before we approach him, let's bring him one of those telepathic parrots we captured. It'll be a great way to establish goodwill."<br/><br/>Strictly speaking, the first example begins with extra-diagetic reasoning (which I call "mechanics first thinking"), while the second starts with diagetic reasoning (I.e. immersive reasoning, or "fiction-first thinking").<br/><br/>Personally, I think either method is totally, completely, categorically great, <i>as long as the mechanics and fiction are mutually entailed</i>. As long as one passes smoothly and rapidly into the other, my personal preferences are met. (This is one reason that Torchbearer conflicts are, for me, the least attractive part of the system, because they stay too much at the mechanics level without entailing the fiction as strongly as I would prefer.)<br/><br/>Honestly, a lot of distinctions between the two are needlessly debated. Like, I don't really care about what happens in a player's mental black box--as long as the result is the two (fiction and mechanics) going together, I'm happy. Some folks prefer to think first about the mechanics, and to get to the fiction that way, while others prefer the opposite. Games that support both are flexible winners, in my book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474018/#Comment_474018" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-17T16:01:15+00:00" title="May 17, 2018  4:01PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">@Stephen P</a> I agree that the player's internal thought process isn't the important thing here.  I think a Torchbearer player could describe a smart tactic or clever use of resource regardless of whether they have a specific mechanic in mind. (Maybe they are gunning for an extra die, maybe they are just trusting that there will be some benefit without thinking about what it is).  I would still call either of the examples you provided fiction-first play (if not fiction-first thinking) because they are establishing fiction that will change the direction of the game in some way.<br/><br/>The opposite is invoking a mechanic explicitly and seeing where that takes the fiction.  It would be weird to do this in the adventure phase, since the GM would be presenting the challenge and the solution.<br/><br/>Player: "I am going to roll scout but I want an extra die for supplies."<br/>GM: "You can use the bat guano on the floor.  Add one to your roll and describe how it gives you an advantage."<br/><br/>That said, I think we're agreed that conflicts require this mechanics-first play (and thus mechanics-first thinking).   All the scripting, dice, and fate/persona are working toward resolving mechanics (and winning) and fiction comes after.  I'm fine with this, because I think the conflicts are fun and the consequences (mechanical and fictional) are typically dramatic. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474025/#Comment_474025" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-17T20:08:52+00:00" title="May 17, 2018  8:08PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there is an undercurrent here, which is that "fiction first" is always the better way to play and design.<br/><br/>I understand (and empathize) with that desire: surely the best, ultimate roleplaying would be entirely fiction-first? It sounds like a Platonic ideal, in a sense.<br/><br/>However, the more I learn about this hobby, the more I realize that it's not that simple. I've played (and designed) many wonderful, fantastic entirely rules-first games, and some games handle switching back and forth in a really great way, which is also a boon. Some amount of "rules-first" procedural thinking can really improve the play experience and lead to better gaming, even if, on paper, it doesn't sound "as cool" or as appealing.<br/><br/>As another example, Vincent Baker (it seems to me) designed Apocalypse World intentionally as a game with bits and pieces you can engage from either direction, and I think that plays a big role in the game's success. The game is more robust when, at any given moment, we have some freedom to attack a problem from either direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474033/#Comment_474033" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-17T20:42:15+00:00" title="May 17, 2018  8:42PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><a href="/forums/profile/moconnor">@moconnor</a> I think saying "I roll Scout" and "I roll Scavenger" are extremely natural behaviors when those options exist.
