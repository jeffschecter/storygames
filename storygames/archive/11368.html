So for Over One Hundred Years on story-games I've said I was going to explain to everyone how to make a great campaign out of a really complex and detailed setting.<br/><br/>Setting books are often disparaged around these parts. "Who wants a list of imports and exports? What story significance could that have?" they sniff. Or "If the players want setting details so bad why don't they make it up themselves HUH, answer me that JDCorley, you cannot."  Well sit right down little Billy because Uncle JDCorley is going to explain how those big giant campaign books are not only awesome...but <i>good for story gaming too</i>.  So forget all about the supposed commercial motivation for the so-called "supplement treadmill", (which actually contains the refutation to the jargon inside the jargon itself), I don't know anything about business or commerce and have no clue about money and even if the game companies have some sinister or pathetic reason for coming out with super detailed setting books, it's not of any consequence to me as a story gamer, and when this thread is over, it won't be of any consequence to you either!<br/><br/>And guess what, we are going to actually design a campaign (or several dozen) together with a giant detailed setting and you will then see how right I am about everything!<br/><br/>This whole enterprise assumes there's a GM who is in charge of designing a campaign, though really the techniques can be used just as well by players of games where that responsibility is distributed.<br/><br/>Here is the main principle we will use:<br/><br/><b>It is impossible to put everything in a highly detailed setting into the game, and unadvisable to try.</b><br/><br/>If you think about the modern world as a setting for a game, the benefit of this approach becomes obvious.  If we're playing a game of Texas-based Border Patrol officers fighting supernatural evil summoned by drug cartels, the travails of Czech single mothers may be really interesting, and even exist in the same reality, should the GM decide so, but the relevance to each other is minimal at best (but as you will see, sometimes it will benefit you to look further afield than you might immediately think!)<br/><br/>The "giant detailed seting" I will use for my example is, TA DA, the Kingdoms of Kalamar, the d20 version.  This came out in 2001 as one of the first "big setting books" that came out in the d20 boom, and it shows a bit. I'm not picking one of my favorite big detailed settings, intentionally, because I don't want the reaction to be "oh, JDCorley, detailed settings supplements are still terrible, it's just that YOU'RE SO TALENTED AND GREAT and you love this game so much that you made it terrific".  I don't really love KoK. I haven't even read it in over 5 years. <br/><br/>Kingdoms of Kalamar is a setting for D&amp;D Third Edition, which is a pulp action fantasy game, in case you hadn't heard of it. Now, I may or may not end up using this system - that's a decision you make a little ways down the road. First, I sit down and read the book!  I'll be back when I have something to say about that.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252797/#Comment_252797" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T07:40:53+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  7:40AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man...giant detailed settings.

Stuff that comes to the surface when I think about giant detailed settings:<br/><br/>* Very hard to convince the players to educate themselves on the finer details of what they should be aware of.<br/><br/>* Canon can impinge on creative exploratory freedom.<br/><br/>* Setting detail (setting <i>fidelity</i> is probably more to the point) can be an unwelcome distraction when what you really want to delve into is baseline human truths (ie Premise).<br/><br/>* Most giant detailed settings I've ever read/learned did a fairly good job of setting up baked-in conflict. In fact that's probably the best definition of a giant detailed setting! But I can't tell you how many times I've seen GMs and players artfully dodge those conflicts for all the usual risk-aversion (or to be kinder, taste/preference) reasons.<br/><br/>* Last thought: when the game system interferes with the baked-in conflicts of the giant detailed setting, it makes me want to throw the books out the window.

Let's say you play for 10 sessions, and introduce 5-8 new setting elements per session. That's 80 setting elements max before the game is over. (And you really shouldn't be still introducing new setting elements in the last few sessions, but whatever.)  You can easily pull 80 setting elements out of 30 setting description pages.  Compare this to a 3,000 page pile of sourcebooks and you see that it is not to the players' advantage to really learn the setting. There's no point to it - they won't gain any benefit from it - it won't impact the game.<br/><br/>Compare this to, for example, a 300 session game.  If you expect or desire such a long game, it benefits you to know the setting because it will actually matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252842/#Comment_252842" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T10:16:47+00:00" title="January 26, 2010 10:16AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Compare this to, for example, a 300 session game.

The former tends not to be considered a "big setting" - but it fits with most of Paul B's complaints.  There are a huge number of canonical details, and indeed there are many who complain about sticking to real-world details in historical or modern games.  I've also played in three campaigns set in Harn.  I've also played in a number of games set in canonical worlds that aren't as directly detailed - like Amber, Star Trek, or the Buffyverse.  <br/><br/>In my experience, player buy-in for detailed settings has been pretty good.  This seems to match with what I see more broadly.  Traditional tabletop RPGs include both high-detail big settings and low-detail settings - and both seem to have firm niches with neither end dominant.  Harn is one of the few 1980s games / settings that still has an active fan base.  <br/><br/>I think the main key for player buy-in is just the same as for any game.  Don't try to push a game that players don't want on them, but rather agree with them about what you all are interested in.  As Roger notes, this may occur when players are already fans of a given setting.  However, it's also possible for people to <i>become</i> fans of a given setting - after all, setting fans come from somewhere.  So if there's a setting and players are interested, then they may get into it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252866/#Comment_252866" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T11:48:53+00:00" title="January 26, 2010 11:48AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2010 12:08PM by komradebob.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>I'm thinking of fictiony bits in White Wolf games, and Continuum, and lavish, inspiring artwork.

I've never been under the impression that WW set out with a great sneaky plan in place to do so, but they did accomplish it nonetheless. <br/><br/>Certainly the oVamp players I was playing with were collecting first their own clanbooks, then other clanbooks and using info from them in-game to their advantage.

I'm not sure it makes a big difference if the 300 page manual is 80% setting or 80% rules.<br/><br/>What does the equation look like?  I think it looks like this:<br/><br/>"I want you guys to invest X amount of time for the reward of Y amount of fun, at Z risk."<br/><br/>How can we mangle that equation?<br/><br/>1.  Reduce X.  The logical extreme: the zero-prep, pickup-and-play game.  Harper's work in this end of the pool comes to mind.<br/><br/>2.  Increase Y.  I think this is the usual tactic.  Play this game and you'll have so much fun your head will explode.<br/><br/>3.  Reduce Z.  Marketing really comes to the fore with this, I'd say.  Another game by that genius designer Professor McFunStuff.<br/><br/><br/>I've simplified out a lot of things with this; maybe too much.  I don't consider the case that X time is inherently fun, for example.  Y fun is perhaps better expressed as fun-per-hour.  Etc.

You know, that thing that never seems to happen? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I also think Hero Wars does a sweet job of it, as well - it demands that you get interested in Glorantha if you're going to get interested in your character. All three major keywords - culture, profession, and magic - tie you into something in-setting, in-culture, *right away*. Especially the magic keyword - it positions you all the more tightly in a specific niche in Glorantha, but still in relation to everything else.<br/><br/>And Paul, I don't think there are really all that many non-giant, non-detailed settings, at least not that I've seen - games tend to emphatically say "make up your own, but in this general direction" or they say "here's a pocket universe, in book form!" <i>Sorcerer and Sword</i> is a good example of the former - in fact, Edwards made a point of saying that's what you should do with it. He's a big hater on some meta-plot. <br/><br/>I think the big obstacles to getting people more excited about GDS's (yeah, it's been TLA'd, now) are a) the number of physical copies of the core book/setting book, for doling out to everybody and giving them, say, a fortnight to digest it all and come back burning with ideas and b) the amount of time and assumed commitment this takes, especially if we're talking about playing a shorter or a longer game. <br/><br/>Now me, if I like a setting, I'll read up on it for its own sake, to a point, whether the upcoming game will be just a few sessions or as long as some months. I can't say the same for a lot of people out there, though, and my experience with Story-games.com folks here in DC has been a general tendency towards pick-up games, one-shots, and the like, given the sheer logistical nightmare it can be to get the same 3-6 people to show up at the same place on a routine, if not scheduled, basis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252909/#Comment_252909" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T13:48:09+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  1:48PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>If players come to a setting like Star Trek, Star Wars, Middle Earth, The Song of Ice and Fire, Amber, Mouse Guard, etc, already excited because of novels or films or comics, that's one thing.

Prospective GMs who're enthused about those settings aren't facing a marketing challenge?</blockquote>\nNot in my case, no.  For me, Harn was a market draw rather than a marketing challenge.  I met my good friend Jim because he advertised looking for players for a Harn game, and I responded.  What was a marketing challenge was for our third Harn campaign together, when Jim wanted to try using the Burning Wheel rules for a game set in Harn.  The other players were profoundly skeptical, while I was neutral.  <br/><br/>I don't think I'm alone in this.  From a bit of hanging out in Harn communities, it seems like there are a fair number of players who actively look for a Harn game - probably more so than players who look for a Dogs in the Vineyard game.  (Though to be fair, most of those are people I wouldn't want to play with.)  <br/><br/>I think a difference in view is that you see learning about a fantasy world as being an un-fun chore that one has to get through to get to play.  Such people are indeed a marketing challenge for giant detailed settings, but I don't think they're the core audience.  I think people like me who are into Harn aren't like that - we have fun learning about a fantasy world in much the same way as we have fun reading a fantasy novel.  For marketing to this core, I think the most important strategy is to make the setting interesting in its own right, rather than just a thin excuse for adventures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252910/#Comment_252910" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T13:48:31+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  1:48PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I may have gone off the rails a bit with my earlier post(s); sorry about that, folks.  I'll fork off another thread for the issues that I think are related but perhaps not core to this topic.<br/><br/>So, to wit:  <i>Have you ever seen an RPG text step up to this specific marketing challenge?</i><br/><br/>I'll suggest two settings I'm aware of that I think have succeeded:  Dragonlance, and Forgotten Realms.<br/><br/>Each have (literally) hundreds of novels that delve into their respective settings, with several reaching the New York Times top 10 bestsellers list.<br/><br/>If some people out there don't want to accept those as "RPG texts", that's fine.  In my opinion, they are.<br/><br/>Does this imply that the original LotR books are RPG texts with respect to role-playing set in Middle Earth?  I would say so.<br/><br/><br/>To coerce that into an actual workflow process for the beleaguered GM:  If I wanted to run a game set in Middle Earth and the players didn't know what I was talking about and didn't want to leap into it, I'd say: here, read these books by this guy named Tolkien.  If they didn't care for the setting after that, I'd know that there would be little point in browbeating them into playing my game.  If they loved it, we'd be ready to go play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252912/#Comment_252912" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T13:57:25+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  1:57PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have actually run a giant, twenty-year, God-alone-knows-how-many-sessions game set in Glorantha; in which over the years we became a tiny subculture of our own.

I break them up into little bits, decide which bits I want to use, figure out how those bits hang together, and focus the game itself around that.  What a giant detailed setting gives to me is a bunch of ideas, and a place I can turn to for a quick answer/idea fix when I realize that I need another couple of bits to round things out.  In practical terms, this generally means focusing the actual game on a specific group of regions, a particular set of political/social/whatever organizations, and so on.  As mentioned above, this is basically the same no matter what we're playing, giant detailed setting or not -- we focus our attention on the things that relate to the game most directly, and downplay or ignore the things that don't.<br/><br/>I've never tried using all of a giant detailed setting in a single game.  I doubt that I ever would -- I don't want to run one campaign long enough to use everything in a 300-page tome, for one thing.  I have, on the other hand, run games where I let people refer to the giant detailed setting and steer the game with it ("I really want to go to the polar regions and bring back trophies of all of the gargantuan evil monsters who live there" or whatever).  If someone wants to poke at a part of the setting I had not originally intended to focus on, having a giant detailed setting book means they can do that and I can easily oblige them.<br/><br/>I've also never plunked down a 300-page giant detailed setting on the table and said "Okay, this is what I want to run, so all of you are going to have to read it before we can start."  I'll type up a 1-2 page reference for the things that everyone should know, I'll point out particular features they should know and answer any questions when we do the character creation session, but I'm not going to assign homework.  If someone wants to read all 300 pages, yay for them, but my primary goal is to make the setting entertaining and satisfying for the person who <i>doesn't</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252948/#Comment_252948" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T15:48:44+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  3:48PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Wow, people are really interested in this.

But that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about bigtastic settings that GM's are enthused about (keywords in thread title: giant, detailed, settings). Have you ever seen an RPG text step up to this specific marketing challenge?<br/><br/>Paul<br/><br/>I am not sure I have seen an RPG text, with a big setting behind it, step up to it.<br/><br/>When I played Midnight, it was easy to just say, "99 years after a Sauron-clone won," and the players just got it.<br/><br/>After that, we carved out a piece of the setting for ourselves, mostly around the main PC's father, Vildar Esben.  JJ read about him and was interested in him.  I suggested that his character was Vildar's son and we were off to the races.  That drove the entire campaign and all from a paragraph about an NPC.<br/><br/>I like big settings that have lots of campaign hooks per paragraph, things to inspire and draw in the players but that have lots of room for us to make shit up.<br/><br/>In Dictionary of Mu, one of the main things I was testing for was to see if after reading two or three short dictionary entries and their descriptors, if the players were all bought in to the same setting and it seemed to work at con after con.  That was when I knew it was ready, when I saw several different groups make up characters together, away from me and away from online communities and come up with really dark fantasy shit.<br/><br/>Some of this is technical too.  I have seen people use setting as an excuse to say, "NO!" when what was being described by the players was very much in line with what was in the books and the setting oculd have just as easily been used to say, "Yes, but..."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252950/#Comment_252950" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T15:50:41+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  3:50PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Feel free to hijack the thread until I return.</blockquote>\nBrian and I are interested in ideas about how bigtastic setting games (that aren't derived from books, comics, or film) might better enable a  GM to market the game to prospective players and create enthusiasm.<br/><br/>Ideas we've seen already, like "publish novels" (unless you're going to tell me why it works for Dragonlance and didn't for Earthdawn, that is, how to do it right), "make sure everyone has a copy of the core book," and "do a one-sheet for the setting" aren't particularly interesting, because yeah, they don't really work that well.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252952/#Comment_252952" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T16:04:51+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  4:04PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>But why doesn't it work?

It exists to get the group on the same page (and inspire situations, characters, conflicts, color, etc.)<br/><br/>What GMs need to do, is be able to make a quick sale on a) what the setting is about, and b) how that's actually going to apply to their game.   Note that a lot of bigtastic settings are set up shotgun style- the bigtasticness is set up to give GMs a wide range to pick from both A &amp; B.  <br/><br/>In other words, now the GM has both the issue of picking what they want and then communicating that effectively to the group.<br/><br/>After that?  If the players familiarize themselves with the setting (or are already familiar) then you have the problem of whether players actually take the same idea(s) from the setting or get caught up in something else.<br/><br/>This is where canon moves from putting people on the same page instead to moving onto different pages.  I've encountered it several, several times with stuff like Legend of the Five Rings, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars or Mage, where different takes on the setting info served as wedges into "what this game is about" rather than unifiers.

I get that one of the fundamental assumptions of no-setting games is that everyone creates the setting together and therefore everyone is enthusiastic and loves it -- but as a practical matter, I find it's easier to get one person who is enthusiastic about and loves a setting and five people who are <i>open to loving</i> a setting than it is to get six people all jazzed up simultaneously.<br/><br/>So I find it hard to think beyond my actual day-to-day experience here:  in every successful new setting I've ever played in or run a game using, one person enthusiastically pitched the setting to everyone else...not to make them fall in love with it completely, but just to get them interested in it and willing to play.  And then we played the game, and if the game was good and showed off the things that made that first person fall in love with the setting, I saw everyone else fall in love (or at least "like") with it, too.  Is there actually any other way for a GM to market a game to prospective players and create enthusiasm?<br/><br/><br/>(Or were you actually asking whether there was a way for game designers to write giant detailed settings that essentially market themselves to prospective players?

Star Wars Episode IV is about a farmboy rescuing a princess. As the hero doesn't know much about the world, the audience learns about it at the same pace as the story unfolds. The same goes for Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms, Warhammer and all other settings that have existed for 20+ years and have generated a ton of books and supplements.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that if you want to sell a GDS to you players you should have a look at how Unknown Armies presents the world. You have Street Level, Global Level and Cosmic Level. Beginners can start of at Street Level and learn about the world as they go. Experienced players can start at Global Level and immediately emerge themselves in the politics of the world. And advanced players can start of at Cosmic Level and try to become the movers and shakers of the world. This way you spoonfeed the players with exactly the amount of information they need and want.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be great if games designers integrate these three levels in their rules system. Street Level gives the basic rules (mostly combat), Global Level gives advance rules (leading a company, social mechanics) and Cosmic Level gives advanced rules (leading a country, epic sorcery, attaining godhood).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253020/#Comment_253020" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T01:31:27+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  1:31AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there are two different issues with getting players to invest in giant, detailed settings.  <br/><br/>One, which has been discussed a lot so far, is how to get everyone to know enough facts about the fictional world to make a contribution.  I think the general the tactics for dealing with this are well-known: start playing with low-level characters in a small area, to limit the amount players need to know.  As the players become more experienced, their characters gain levels (so they learn the extra mechanics) and expand their horizons (so they learn more setting details).  In this case, the key skill of the GM is to pick the one small facet of the world that will entice players into the game; after that, they can drip-feed th rest.  <br/><br/>Another issue, which I don't think has been touched on yet, is how to deal with PCs being from a different culture from the players.  For instance, I've got shedloads of Tekumel and Glorantha gaming material.  The main thing that interests me about those settings isn't so much the kewl p0werz the PCs get, or even the setting bling, but it's the different mindset of the people in them.  For instance, the default Tekumel setting has family and clan considerations far more important than is the norm in Western culture.  Tekumel people will do all sorts of unpleasant things, and make terrible sacrifices, for the good of their group rather than for personal gain.  If I run a Tekumel game, <em>that's</em> the kind of thing I'm interested in exploring.  I don't really want to play 'people with Western mindsets get dumped into an alien culture', I want to play 'Tekumel people deal with problems that can only exist in this kind of culture'.  <br/><br/>Getting that cultural buy-in is something that, I think, takes a conscious effort in the part of the players.  If they take that step, the play can be very rewarding.  But how to convince them to take that step?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253064/#Comment_253064" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T06:27:08+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  6:27AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya,<br/><br/>The biggest hindrance to players engaging the Bigtastic Setting IMO is the utter lack of mechanical tie-ins to what the players are interested in doing.  Of the five areas of exploration, Setting is the least integrated into Character.  We know how to make Situation matter to characters.  We know that System matters.  Color always matters.  But Setting and Character seem to have been kept nearly exclusive of each other.<br/><br/>Players will care about the Big Setting if there is a reason to care.  If the mechanics of character creation or the reward system is directly tied to setting elements, then the players will care.  If trade is important to the Setting, it must be important to the characters.  There should be a character element or reward mechanic that involves trade and encourages the players to exploit that tie-in.  This goes way beyond the token Lore skill many games have.  It has to matter to what the characters are and what the players want to do.<br/><br/>Think also about how under-developed race (species, really) is when it comes to game mechanics.  There is no incentive in most games to learn about one\u2019s racial heritage.  In the Lord of the Rings, racial heritage is what is driving every single character.  From the Uruk-hai to the Noldor to the Istari Wizards.  In the run-of-the-mill Fantasy or Sci-fi game, where is that?  Where\u2019s the incentive to do that?<br/><br/>I like what Paul\u2019s getting at with the marketing thing.  He\u2019s right; games don\u2019t do that every well.  I believe that\u2019s partly because they don\u2019t provide the GM with anything to market with nor provide the players any reason to care about the marketing in the first place.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253068/#Comment_253068" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T06:43:53+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  6:43AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: northerain</cite>Maybe it's just me, but those don't grab me at all.</blockquote>\nBudweiser beer commercials don't make me want to drink Budweiser either, but they work on <i>some</i> people.

I think the problem comes in when you have a disparity of knowledge amongst the players.  Imagine this: one guy spends hours with all of the core books and learns all sorts of details about a particular setting because it grabs him.  The other players, on the other hand, haven't spent the same amount of time with the source material.  Now you have a disparity, and one player will always be hoping that the others will catch up and derive the same amount of enjoyment from the setting as he has.<br/><br/>The other problem comes when the player with all the knowledge wants to inject back-story material into the game.  The other players will misunderstand the context, and the back-story contribution will fall flat.<br/><br/>This isn't just a problem with big fictional settings either.  Look at a game like Spione.  If you're playing with one or two people who are major spy buffs, and others with only passing knowledge of spy history, then you're going to get an unsatisfying play experience.<br/><br/>To solve this problem, the players have to start at the same level and learn the backstory together -- or the designer has to provide a game text or system that allows the more invested player to have patience while the less experienced get hooked and learn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253083/#Comment_253083" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T07:57:22+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  7:57AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2010 7:59AM by Tim C Koppang.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite><br/>Brian and I are interested in ideas about how bigtastic setting games (that aren't derived from books, comics, or film) might better enable a  GM to market the game to prospective players and create enthusiasm.</blockquote>\nPaul,<br/><br/>This is a different issue from what I was talking about in my previous post.  Your question assumes that one player is already heavily invested in a particular setting.  Now, how does that player sell new players on the setting?  And how can a game designer help facilitate this sale?<br/><br/>Everyone learning together is obviously not an option anymore.  Putting aside the issue of, "Will it be rewarding for an experienced player to game with a less experienced player when the setting material is vast," I think you are right to characterize this problem as one of marketing.  Essentially, the experienced player has to effectively communicate his enthusiasm and, and the same time, not scare off potential players.<br/><br/>So how can the designer help?  Provide easy entrance points.  If you overwhelm new players, I think they're more likely to look for another game that doesn't seem so difficult.  I do think that lush, evocative illustrations help because they are easy and quick to take in.  Beyond that, I think a designer should provide the experienced players with two or three setting "starting points": short, almost self-contained, sub-settings that can be quickly described.  If these little bits plus the illustrations from a game aren't enough to grab a potential player, then maybe it's just time to try a different game.<br/><br/>Can I think of any games that actually do this well?  Not off hand, but I'd be excited to see someone try.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253084/#Comment_253084" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T07:59:41+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  7:59AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another issue I'd like to hear more about is the issue of all that *stuff* that's been set in stone before you start playing--it can easily come into conflict with the needs of the story.<br/><br/>I can't count how many times I've played some game in a detailed setting where it became clear that some X would really make the game cool, a fantastic plot twist, a great story, or maybe just necessary for consistency. Like if you're running a game and you realize it would be really, really cool if you could have the villain tell the hero, "I am your father." Cool twist, right? And sometimes a story is just begging for a twist like that. Well, how much would it suck if a player at the table, at that point, stands up and explains why good old Darth is from a different subspecies of human that actually could NOT possibly have impregnated Luke's mother?<br/><br/>If you're playing in a more open field, that sort of thing doesn't happen.<br/><br/>This sort of thing comes up in "realistic" games, too, like when someone wants to play a strong, empowered female character in some really misogynistic society or period of history.<br/><br/>It also applies in the "real world".

I tend to like historical movies or even documentaries at least as much as Hollywood blockbusters, though there are a number of Hollywood blockbusters that I enjoy.  <br/><br/>I think that the real world has an enormous amount of interesting material to offer, that goes beyond "technicalities and details."  I think that research can greatly enrich a film of almost any type, adding not just technicalities, but by providing new insights.  Documentaries in particular are extremely limited by both the real world and practicalities of filming, yet I think there is still room for an enormous amount of creativity in what a documentary tells.  Say, if there is a documentary about some real-world subject, and a Hollywood drama that is loosely based on it, I don't think it is at all a given that the documentary is about technicalities whereas the Hollywood drama has interesting story.  Really, it depends on what you're looking for.  If you're looking for what some scriptwriter sitting in his basement thinks of as cool, then pesky things like real people, real lives, real cultures, and real phenomena are a distraction from that.  However, there are some people who find those real world things themselves as cool, and are looking to the film not to produce something in spite of the real world, but to convey and illuminate what they find in the real world.  <br/><br/>I think this applies to fictional sources as well, in my opinion.  For example, in a film based on an original book, I think there is a lot to be gotten from close reading and thoughtful analysis of the text.  It can work to just tell a cool story and see the text as something that gets in the way of that, but I think it can also work to use the text as a direct source - to tell stories <i>from</i> it just as a documentary tells stories from the real world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253244/#Comment_253244" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T13:47:48+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  1:47PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mordheim</cite>Many of the Giant Detailed Settings(tm) start out small.

My first Harn campaign was set in a small village in Rethem, and we had many local adventures before we started to move further afield.  <br/><br/>I think that is a good option, too, if you have a mix of players who know a lot about the setting and those who are new to it.  The expert players can make expert characters who know a lot, while the new players can make characters like Luke Skywalker who may be talented and/or destined for greatness, but know little about the wider world at the beginning.  It's important that the new characters are still important and powerful in ways that compensate for their being unsure of themselves.

Please do tell.<br/>My "documentary" comment was more a parallel about making the film version of a book without changing it - like, say, Lord of the Rings.  You're taking almost the exact story as written, but by what you choose to put in foreground and background, by what you show and don't show, and so forth - you are engaged in a deeply creative act and telling a story.  <br/><br/>But getting to gaming...<br/><br/>You can't use a documentary-like process in RPGs because they are fundamentally original fiction (at least in their current form).  However, you can do some vaguely parallel things like creating new takes on the same situation.  For example, I ran a Star Trek campaign that was set in the years following the original Star Trek series.  Several of the episodes in that were what my players referred to as "cleaning up Kirk's messes."  So they would visit a planet that had appeared in the original series, and those events had happened, but they had to deal with further consequences to the situation.  This was more-or-less sticking to canon, as I kept things as they were.  However, by fleshing out the situation and the sides, and potentially looking at other views - these "clean-up" episodes were often thoughtful commentary on the original series, rather than simple pastiche.  <br/><br/>For example, there was an episode about the the planet Eminiar VII (from "A Taste of Armageddon") who had engaged in a virtual war with their planetary neighbor, killing real people as a consequence.  An emissary of that culture wanted to re-instate the protocols that allowed the war, because to he felt that the respect for virtual worlds as real was an important part of their culture.  Eventually, the PCs decided to allow them that - the captain disagreed, but decided that it wasn't her place to interfere in a local war between parties that were not part of the Federation.  (More specifically, she said "Hey, we're the (annoying) Organians here.")  Whether to interfere in another people's civil war is a very tricky question, and I thought that episode dealt with it well.  <br/><br/>I'm saying that's a case where I was drawing from canon.  That is, it wasn't that I had a story to tell and that Star Trek canon could potentially interfere with what I wanted to say.  Instead, that was a story that came about because I watched a Star Trek episode and was intrigued by what further potential there was in that exact situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253345/#Comment_253345" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T21:10:26+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  9:10PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay!  I have now gotten sufficiently into Kingdoms of Kalamar that I am absolutely confident I picked the right setting book for this exercise/example. The organization of the book, while quite clear, is exactly the opposite of what would make for a great setting in a story. First you talk about races and species. Then each geographic area gets coverage.  Then there's a "notable organizations" section.  Then there is a section on languages. Then gods.  And it provides a great challenge for GMs (which I will use here as a shorthand for "content generator", remember the same thoughts can be applied to players who generate content as well) who are trying to get things across to the characters.  I don't think I could possibly have picked a book that was more "catalog of random facts" to for this demonstration.<br/><br/>Let's take a few pages at random and see how we read them when we're designing an effective setting.<br/><br/>But before we do that we need to do something else: establish our goals. As I mentioned above, a 10-session game is different from a 300-session game (I don't agree that that is necessarily a 10 year game. It's barely a 1 year game when you're in high school!)  Both of those are different from a convention game.<br/><br/>Sometimes there is a particular game system that you're committed to using.  You're not necessarily locked into using the game system that the designer thought would be a good idea.  (Sometimes, as when using the real world for a game, there is no such game system. Other times the designer is just dumb or got hit by a bus or whatever, who cares.)<br/><br/>You'll want to know something about your gaming group's preferences and/or set parameters if you are setting up a gaming group.  If you know someone likes political stuff, you will want to be looking for political hooks.  If you pick something with a lot of political hooks, you will want to recruit players interested in that kind of thing.<br/><br/>So for the purposes of this exercise, here's what I've got for my goals.<br/><br/>My players are...A bunch of really creative story-oriented hippies. They may not be hardcore more-macho-than-thou who don't care about anything if it doesn't address a theme and will blurt out "who cares" in the middle of combats, but they want to have some kind of character development beyond their abilities and handle dramatically charged situations.  Though they're okay with the GM-and-players responsibility divide, they will want their instrument for affecting the setting, namely, their character, to have sufficient impact on the setting that they feel like they're shaping the story significantly.  But they are pretty open-minded as far as going along with what I'm interested in.<br/><br/>The campaign will be around 5-7 months of weekly play, my usual length of time for a campaign.  Around 25-35 sessions depending on if there are some weeks we're bored and meet twice or some weeks where I'm sick or out of town or whatever.<br/><br/>All right, now we go to a random place in the book and see what we get.<br/><br/>p.87:  This is a description of The City-State of P'Bapar, Independent.  Economically strong, due to the great variety of wealth provided by dwarf clan and gnomes in nearby mountains, though they have scarce farmlands.  It's at the top of a major river trade route.  Militarily, the biggest threat is monsters in the mountains.  Mercenaries supplement a small mounted and footsoldier military, along with a citizen militia in times of dire need.  The biggest temples are those of the Prolific Coin, the Church of Chance and the House of Laughter, which has a wine cellar that is possibly the best in the world.<br/><br/>Ah, this is great.  Virtually generic, of course, but perfect, in fact, for a 30 session game.<br/><br/>Here are the factors in the environment this description gives us:<br/><br/>* Libertine temples<br/>* Monsters as a threat to civilization (rather than rival civilizations) <br/>* Counts on the support of nearby organizations to get the food to survive<br/>* Major trade route and lots of traffic<br/><br/>And four things happen to be the exact number of narrative forces that are needed for a solid 30 sessions.  (It may even be a little much.)<br/><br/>So here are some campaign ideas I mull over for this page:<br/><br/>* There's a crisis! The characters are mustered into the militia as first level jerkoffs, still above their fellow farmers and dweebs, but thrust into a dangerous situation against MONSTARS.  There's conflict between the authorities and the dwarf clans on the best way to handle the situation and the stakes are the survival of the city and surrounding areas.<br/><br/>This is good because there's lots of adventure and the characters are able to deal themselves into the political situation by virtue of being thrust into the middle of the conflict.  AND, haha, you can have someone be the "reluctant hero", which is great. There's someone in your group that thinks Wolverine isn't terrible, right?  There's always one.  And war and combat is always a good backdrop or way to spice up the campaign.<br/><br/>* The characters are libertines and layabouts at one of the Temples when one of the puritanical dwarven clans begins to push out their relaxed layaboutness and yelling at them to get a haircut.  The authorities are helpless - they have the food supply, after all.  Nevertheless the characters must become missionaries and emissaries to convince the other side to at least leave them alone.  Ooh, no, half the characters are from the Temple and the other half are stoic dwarven twerps who learn the true meaning of Christmas, I mean making it with hot hippie chicks.<br/><br/>This is good because the characters have a built-in arc, and - huge plus - there's a good reason to banter.  It's also nice because I can send them together to all parts of this bit of the setting, having them fight monstars, or go deal with traders, or mercenaries, or whatever problem their various patrons might have an opinion on.  The patrons, when I make them, should be open to the characters changing their minds about things.  If the temple characters come back and say "Duuude, those little dudes have some good ideas about keeping everyone safe and relaxed, bro, maybe we should cut them a break and turn the music down like they ask" their patron should take it seriously, even if they don't eventually go for it, we should avoid the emissary-game problem of constantly having to check back with a boss who won't listen.  Finally, this is a funny campaign idea. People will laugh and have a good time.<br/><br/>Now, how did I come up with these campaign ideas? It's pretty simple.  I picked two factions that I could steer against each other, used a third for the "environment" of the story, and ignored the fourth.  The fourth is in the "dugout" for if things start to drag, or the players wrap things up faster than I expect them to.  I then worked out a way for the characters to be aligned partly, but not inextricably, with one or another of the factions.<br/><br/><b>First Level Jerkoff Militia Story</b><br/>Two sides: Authorities/Mercenaries and the Dwarf Clans<br/>Environment: Monstars<br/>Dugout: Traders and Temple<br/><br/><b>Cheech &amp; Gimli Story</b><br/>Two Sides: Temples and Dwarves<br/>Environment: Authorities/Traders<br/>Dugout: Monstars<br/><br/>This is also why lists of imports/exports and "faction lists" are good, by the by.  Let's say we do Cheech &amp; Gimli.  Knowing that the "paka birds that live near the northern edge of DuKem'p Swamp are sought for their soft feathers" might be important because the paka birds are being hunted to a dangerously low level by a need for softer feather beds and pillows in the city, or maybe elven jackoffs begin to demand a "paka tax" from hunters and maybe that's a good idea or a bad idea, let's send our heroes out to check out the situation.  By applying what is or isn't produced to the situation we can develop specific plot elements.<br/><br/>I'll do this for a few other pages in the book, then we'll talk about what you do next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Giant Detailed Settings And Story-Gaming! - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11368/giant-detailed-settings-and-story-gaming/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Giant Detailed Settings And Story-Gaming! - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11368/giant-detailed-settings-and-story-gaming/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Damn, this is clever.

Just sayin'.</blockquote>\nIsn't it? I mean, all <b>I</b> did was be interested in story when designing a campaign.  Sure, yes, there is a certain point of view from which game design and writing is mere fodder, a pile of dead wood and a scattering of tools, but it's not usually a point of view Story Hyphen Games Dot Com gets behind easily. I didn't come up with any of those faction ideas, the Kalamar writers did.  All I did was - 1) have an interest in story, and 2) open the book at random and design a couple of campaigns from where my finger landed.<br/><br/>Let's look at it another couple of ways:<br/><br/>* I have a different gaming group. These are punch 'em in the face dudes who like lots of combat. They don't mind a bit of story, in fact they really like a bit of story connecting up the combats, that way the fights are more exciting as they're fighting for something. But they want tons of combat.  So, I make a campaign with a mercenary group fighting monstars, and prepare a list of customers both pathetic ("please come save our village!") and overbearing ("I SUPPOSE I can let you dim bulbs help me out")<br/><br/>* I have a different campaign length. I'm running a one-shot at a convention for the purpose of showing people how great the One Roll Engine is. I need a quickly recognizable situation with a relatively quick progression from simple, low-pressure tests to more elaborate and difficult challenges.  The characters are members of a trading company who are low on money and returning to the city to pick up some cargo to ferry downstream. They have to deal with uncaring authorities and kick back having fun at the temple, but the pressure is on once they have the cargo and monstars attack.<br/><br/>All I have done is to know myself and my situation. That's the only thing I brought to Kalamar - the book did the rest!<br/><br/>Next post I will show you how to actually pick out the page that you're going to do this to instead of just, oracle-style, opening the book at random.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253397/#Comment_253397" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T07:26:08+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  7:26AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite><br/>For example, there was an episode about the the planet Eminiar VII (from "A Taste of Armageddon") who had engaged in a virtual war with their planetary neighbor, killing real people as a consequence.

It's called "Shock:Human Contact" and it's a far-future setting that encourages setting creation.<br/><br/>It's my response to Star Trek, so it'll have exploration of planets and an organization that explores them, but the idea is to detrivialize the things that Trek trivializes: the culture clash, the languages, the sexual politics, the assumption of superiority, the assumption of moral high ground, the travel, the technologies, the complexity of planets' societies.<br/><br/>It has specific elements of setting that act as handles, and then notable gaps that players will have to fill in when they need to know what's there.

The whole group could even watch the episode together, I suppose.<br/><br/>2) Using the whole existing Star Trek canon to inform that same game?<br/><br/>What do you see as features and quirks/drawbacks of doing it those two ways?</blockquote>\nAs I see it, it's similar to the contrast of (1) setting a game in 19th century Korea after watching a single movie or TV show episode set there without knowing anything else about it, and (2) setting a game in 19th century Korea with additional reading and watching on the background, political situation, culture, and so forth.  You can do <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and still have a fun game.  However, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> takes more background, but that background adds potential layers of depths to the game.  In role-playing characters, there are huge questions of where loyalties lie, what religious and cultural beliefs are, and so forth.  (This is a real example, in that the last campaign I GMed was set in a version of 19th century Korea.)  <br/><br/>Taking this back to Star Trek...  For example, in my first Star Trek campaign, one of the early characters was a devout Muslim Star Fleet officer.  I'd say that if this character would have been vastly different if we had all just watched one Star Trek episode rather than knowing the series, and unpacking it further for the campaign.  There was a lot of context to think about over who Star Fleet officers are and what they are fighting for.  In set up for the campaign, we unpacked things like what the politics of the Federation and Star Fleet are, the context for the Prime Directive, and how money works.  <br/><br/>Now, as for using the whole canon...  In the case of Star Trek, the canonical material is not internally consistent and is also so massive that neither GM nor players had watched or read it all.  We had all seen all or most of the original series episodes, though, which is a more limited set so that was the core of the canon for that game.  I dealt with internal inconsistencies by saying that all of the episodes could be considered as the equivalent of well-researched made-for-TV docudramas in that universe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253456/#Comment_253456" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T10:44:45+00:00" title="January 28, 2010 10:44AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Though, can you unpack what using a faction as "environment" means.

One group playing in Kalamar can talk about adventures in City-State of P'Bapar. Another group can talk about their adventures in Brandobia. And the two groups have something in common, and probably have something in common (exploration of the comparably small religious setting material, racial stereotypes, etc.) for comparison.<br/><br/>However, I've seen this done pretty well in small settings, such as in The Shab-al-Hiri Roach, which uses recurring events and characters to provide a shared context between games. Or Montsegur 1244, right? But these are basically one-shot game setups. <br/><br/>Another cool thing big settings offer is grand scope: even if you don't use all that stuff, you know it's there, waiting for you. That's kinda cool. You feel like the world is way bigger than this little village whence your character hails. <br/><br/>Yes, you CAN do both of those things with smaller settings, but there's more smoke and mirrors required to pull it off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253572/#Comment_253572" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T16:41:06+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  4:41PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>This is where the game is.

An amazing breakthrough, in my view.<br/><br/>By starting small in local (a village in Dragon Pass, for example), the GM could, per Jason's calculations, begin giving the Players the basics of Glorantha, growing out the details and knowledge of the setting through play. By creating a strong, pan-Glorantha situation (the Gods are at War, the Fate of the World and All the World's People's are in Play) the game automatically creates conflict for the Players to latch onto. The focus of the game within that conflict can be played out in family strife in a village to wars between societies to HeroQuests into spiritual realms.<br/><br/>I GMed a one-shot in Dragon Pass at a convention once. One person really knew the setting, I had crammed the setting, and the other two players did not know the setting. We spent an hour and half making characters. And in that hour and a half the Players chose the elements of the setting that mattered to them most, had them written down as attributes on their character sheets that then drove the story cleanly and fiercely for the next two and a half hours. A blast. And we were definitely playing "in" Glorantha.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this side-steps Jason's points. But I wanted to set down on the table that there hasn't been a conflict between Giant Detailed Setting and Story-Gaming for a while now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253593/#Comment_253593" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-28T18:33:20+00:00" title="January 28, 2010  6:33PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not at all - my methods are my methods.

You can do <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and still have a fun game.  However, <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> takes more background, but that background adds potential layers of depths to the game.  In role-playing characters, there are huge questions of where loyalties lie, what religious and cultural beliefs are, and so forth.

Working from an established set of material creates strong expectations (and sometimes very emotional ones, esp. with beloved fiction or personally-relevant historical episodes) in all the players, and sometimes two players will have two different viewpoints. In the case of a historical game, consider someone who has been reading from a Marxist interpretation of the events of that period compared to someone whose information comes from a webring of eco-terrorist blogs. <br/><br/>But if the information is seen as the province of one person (like the almighty GM), it's difficult for the other participants to feel free enough to improvise material or field their own ideas. For instance, if I don't know anything about 19th-cy Japan, it's possible my first two or three character concepts for the game might meet with a statement like: "There weren't any of those around at that time." For some players, at that point they might just want to let the GM decide what character they will play rather than keep aiming at a target they can't see. In any case, it's going to be problematic for any group that plays in a more collaborative style to try to simultaneously hew to strict standards of verisimilitude.<br/><br/>This is a very interesting thread, and great to hear different solutions and approaches to many of these difficulties (and opportunities)!

Not 19th century Japan!   19th century Korea!!  [tangent] (This is particularly ironic since this is the period leading up to the Japanese occupation of Korea, during which they asserted that Korea was really a part of Japan and tried to indoctrinate the population with this message - such as making all children attend Japanese schools, speak Japanese, and learn this propaganda.)  [end tangent]<br/><br/>In the big-setting games that I've played in, usually the GM made the most effort to learn all the background, and was the final arbiter of disagreements regarding the background.  There are some exceptions, though.  We had two different GMs for our Harn campaigns, both dedicated Harniacs, and as a player I knew almost as much about Harn as them, though one of the other players was more casual about Harn knowledge.  In the Korea game, I as the GM was the expert, but players would often look up stuff on their own - that is, I was the final authority, but I didn't "control information" in the sense of players always coming to me.  Cynthia looked up a bunch of stuff on mudangs for her PC, say.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>I've found that unless one person (typically the GM) controls all the information (which seems to be the expectation for a lot of these published Giant settings), there are inevitably disgreements or mismatches between the players about how things are within the setting.

Everyone should buy into and agree on the setting.  The use of GM authority is in expedience - i.e. if there's some doubt over some question, the GM can make a quick ruling.  Major things, though, can and should be talked out.  <br/><br/>As an example, I also co-GMed a campaign of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer RPG.  We knew there was a risk of mismatch between us as GMs - not so much about setting detail as about style.  So our approach was that we would take turns - Bill GMs 3 sessions, then I GM 3 sessions.  For my sessions, Bill would give me a set of 3-6 episode pitches of just a few sentences - and I'd base my adventures on those pitches.  Similarly, I'd give a set of pitches to Bill for his sessions.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>But if the information is seen as the province of one person (like the almighty GM), it's difficult for the other participants to feel free enough to improvise material or field their own ideas.

Korea.)  Yeah, that's why I don't think it should be the province of one person.  Someone may need to have final say, but everyone should have knowledge and input.  I don't recall that happening in one of my games.  Usually players feel free enough to improvise material or field their ideas.  <br/><br/>For example, my Korea campaign was in the world of the Temeraire novels by Naomi Novik, where there are domesticated dragons.  The novels are in the 19th century ranging from England to China and in between, but being in Korea meant that we were outside of the usual continuity (and shifted on the timeline).  One of the players wanted to be an Earth Dragon - a wingless dragon adapted for digging.  There wasn't directed precedent for those, but there were some flightless dragons and definitely dragons with extraordinary abilities - so it didn't contradict anything either from the novels or in history.

We were using Spirit of the Century, but I thought that pulp in the spirit of the Temeraire novels was extraordinary but less over-the-top than what she (the player) was picturing, and we compromised.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253834/#Comment_253834" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T13:26:47+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  1:26PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnstone, Adam, etc, I guess I see what you are saying about using setting books as oracles.

I'd just add that the small thing could start with situation as much as with geography.<br/><br/>In Exalted, one of the supplements mentions this element called <i>The Magistracy of Hares.</i>  Magistrates are sort of like itinerant judge-marshalls accountable directly to the Empress.  They go around investigating shit, kicking ass, taking names--and making a lot of enemies.  Normally their enemies have a hard time touching them because of the Empress.  The Empress having disappeared, apparently for good, it's starting to be payback time, and Magistrates are being taken down.  The wiser ones are keeping a low profile.  Now, Magistrates recruit deputies called Archons, taking them from Dragon-Blooded who have been condemned to death for whatever reason.   Baseline situation is very similar to Dogs in the Vineyard in terms of town-to-town style play.<br/><br/>Here's the wrinkle that caught my eye:  <i>If a Magistrate dies, his or her Archons are hunted down and executed by tradition and law.</i><br/><br/>This entire bit practically begs for a situation wherein the players are all Archons whose Magistrate has vanished.  You get each character's criminal past (deserved or not), the enemies closing in with the gallows in the backdrop, the mystery of their Magistrate's whereabouts and fate.  Plenty of front-loaded conflict, plenty of room for diverse characters and sandbox decision-making.   I'd characterize it as <i>The Dirty Dozen</i> meets <i>The Fugitive.</i><br/><br/>Easy enough to drop them in some locality, wind up some political/economic groups with conflicting motives, maybe toss in something foreign to offer an extra complication or a ticking clock, then let it all go and see how it unwinds.  Flesh out the setting or be ready to set up another town if it turns into a run-and-gun affair.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253851/#Comment_253851" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T14:14:51+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  2:14PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hexabolic</cite>This entire bit practically begs for a situation wherein the players are all Archons whose Magistrate has vanished.

They're toe one with that initial spark that sets off the campaign and gets things moving, and tries to get the players to buy into the campaign and be excited for it. <br/><br/>Doing it together as a group can create some real buy-in from all the players as they add bits they want, but the risk is a Stone Soup environment that has Too Much or Too Disparate.<br/>Having a Creative Director means that the campaign has (or should have, if homework is done right) an easily explained tight focus and concept ripe for playing, but the risk is that one or more of the players simply aren't interested in the Game, the Theme, or some idea presented as core.<br/><br/>Anyway, here's some thoughts from some campaigns I ran. You mentioned Dark Sun above. <br/><br/>Dark Sun for me was a total mess, a shitpile of power fantasy gaming. That's what I got from the boxed set. I put it aside. Later, when the supplements were cranking out, I glanced through the Veiled Alliance supplement. Totally up-ended my view of the game and made it interesting, exciting and my single most favorite setting ever: It simply emphasized (through the art; turns out the core book hinted at this, but there was little art so I never "got it"; I'm a visual learner) that each city-state was an analogue of a real-world ancient human culture. That was enough to sink my teeth in, as I loved studying ancient cultures as a teen.<br/><br/>I pulled out the boxed set (still didn't see anything of value therein, so I just used it for rules), kept the the setting bits pulled from The Veiled Alliance (which was more of a City-State guide than a "Magic Cult Guide" it was supposed to be), and came up with a similar kind of methodology. I pointed at the bits I liked and kept a few of them at the core of the game: The city-state of Tyr has just been overthrown. Agents from other city-states are coming in to plant flags. Then all the background Dark Sun stuff about the races not getting along with each other, environments and elements from the city-state background of Tyr, and so on.<br/><br/><b>Early Level Jerkoff Revolution Story</b><br/>Two Sides: Ex slaves of Tyr vs Agents from the City-State of Balic<br/>Environment: The unsettled days after the revolution in Tyr<br/>Dugout: Priestly/Elemental Magic and such concerns (two PCs were priests, and while I had the idea to explore what that meant with everyday normal folk when a PC can simply Create Water, I ended up keeping this in The Dugout, used mostly for filler/backdrop than plot-driving)<br/>The above was a campaign I ran for about a year in high school.<br/><br/>The L5R game I ran last year looked like this:<br/><b>Samurai get Fucked by Evil</b><br/>Two Sides: Crab Samurai in an Outpost vs The Shadowlands Wall<br/>Environment: The wall crumbled down, the shadowlands invaded<br/>Dugout: Clan issues between a crab outpost and the main city.<br/>Dugout 2: (there's only 4 players, so I was able to leave stuff on the side, bring it up when needed) A spy appears to be working with the Shadowlands<br/><br/>Within about 2-3 sessions (it was about a 8-10 session game), it quickly switched to<br/><b>Samurai Fuck Up their Bosses to Stop More Evil</b><br/>Two Sides: Outpost Samurai vs City Samurai/Lords and Nobles<br/>Environment: Pursuing the Shadowlands spy<br/>Dugout: The fallout of the Shadowlands invading (once it happened, we didn't get bogged down in it that much)<br/>Dugout 2: Shadowlands taint<br/><br/>Anyway, if you've seen the L5R book and all those fucking splats, you know that finding a place to start is basically pretty damn hard. I laser-homed in on something I thought would be interesting (this giant fucking wall which protects the land from horrible evil: What happens when it crashes down?), and ignored like 90% of the rest of the setting: Crane, Scorpion, 1/2 of the Lion stuff, Phoenix, Unicorn, etc all either didn't appear at all, or only as minor flavor (one of the Crab Shugenja trained with a Phoenix master, stuff like that). I had to stick to my guns, because adding any more would have really caused the thing to fall apart.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254403/#Comment_254403" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T22:50:57+00:00" title="February  1, 2010 10:50PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, and a question for JD:<br/><br/>What do you do about all those splatbooks, like in the WoD line? <br/><br/>I know you think of the term Supplement Treadmill as a marketing term that designers use (mostly to lament the fact that they don't have the time or money to produce their own treadmills). However, I think of it as a consumer term: To me, I think of it as Dead Weight that exists solely for the gamer who has a lot of reading time on her hands and not a lot of playing time, as well as a disposable income. Most of it is unnecessary, and it can be paralyzing if you try to implement it in a game.<br/><br/>To my own, basically I had read through the L5R book (1st ed) way back when, and at one point or another had bought (eBay), skimmed, read a little, then sold (eBay) all of the major splatbooks for that game. They were in no way helpful for me making a campaign; in fact, back in the day, each new splatbook made me want to run a campaign in that splat's focused setting: Being receptive to splats made it hard to tune out their influence and regain focus.<br/><br/>However, with my game above I basically went through the bits of the core L5R book that I liked, dropped the rest entirely (including all the history based on CCG events: Seriously, is anyone at all interested in that shit?), and focused on the little Crab bit I chose to set the game in. Now, I did read into the Lion section, because one of the players was a Lion samurai: We did that to have a little cultural friction, and to bring up cultural elements (msotly "Dugout" material). But I shied away from bringing in a trail of Scorpion assassins, Crane lords and so on. <br/><br/>My friend lent me some of his books to reread: I went through the Crab splat again, as well as the Shadowlands splats to review those setting elements. They were a LITTLE helpful, but I believe that was only because I had already locked down the direction of the campaign. Without the lockdown I would have been lost in more information. In any case, I stole a few pieces here and there from each book to drop in as Setting Backdrop Sprinkles into the game.<br/><br/>How do others deal with splat material, and how do you decide what to use from it, or even what to buy/read?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254444/#Comment_254444" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T07:05:37+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  7:05AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy,<br/><br/>In my DnD 3e campaigns, we had to deal with this a lot (6 players, ages 20-28).  And it wasn't just setting per-se, it was supplements for classes and races and whatever else.  I just put each person in charge of their own splat.  They were given time to explain why it was important to them and where their characters were going with it.  The group was very invested in each other's success and goals for the game.  So, I think, part of it is at the Social Contract level.  But anyway, each person had their own areas where they were responsible for being the expert.

I played a bunch of Harn, but I think the Harn modules are significantly different in approach and organization from the splatbooks.  In Harn, the modules are clear about what they are detailing - they never change the big picture, but rather fill in details.  In Harn, we used all of the relevant modules, but not everyone read every module - some of it was just communicated verbally from the person or people who had.  <br/><br/>In a setting like World of Darkness, I would probably do similar to what I did for my Star Trek campaign - read a few things that people recommended, and adopt only those that I thought was intriguing and fitting for the world.  So, for example, I adopted John Ford's novel _The Final Reflection_ for my picture of the Klingons in the campaign, but that was the only novel that I included.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254516/#Comment_254516" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T12:29:26+00:00" title="February  2, 2010 12:29PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Troy, that sounds like a good method for dealing with the one million splatbooks problem.

I've found certain splats useful.  In Exalted, for instance, I really like the Dragon-Blooded, because the themes of Crumbling Dynasty, Dysfunctional Family Intrigue, and simply being the underdog in the setting's gonzo power scale all resonate with me.  So the D-B splat book proved useful, though again, more for the sprinkle content.  Likewise, the Compass of Terrestrial Directions book that described the Blessed Isle gave me some cool info.  For me, it's worth having the sprinkle content, but I'm pretty targeted about my purchases and my reading.  For me, it's just a choice about what I'm interested in that lets me winnow out all the other mass of content about the other Exalts and parts of Creation.  I like the Sidereals and Yu-Shan as well, and have a book about that area, but know next to nothing about just about anything else in the setting.<br/><br/>If you're running it, you have to start with something that excites you.  Then try to sell your group and negotiate a common take on your focus that grabs everyone.  The Crab stuff you described sounds like an awesome example.<br/><br/>I've found it helpful if you can grab a piece of a Big Setting that boils down to an elevator pitch, again much like "Samurai Get Fucked by Evil" (which would sell me instantly on playing).  Once you've sold your group on the concept, you can condense the relevant setting piece onto a one page, then leave the rest up to discovery-in-play or emergent creation over the course of the game.  On the one-sheet, I try to keep my background narrative simple and provide mosaic-like bits of imagery or cultural detail to give the players an idea of flavor without burdening them with a pile of textual data.<br/><br/>I also don't treat the setting information as locked-in canon, FWIW.  That way lies madness.  I do identify key pieces that are or appear to be canon, and then leave the rest for development in-game.<br/><br/><i>Edited to add: </i> Any decent setting has fault lines that offer inherent game-exploitable conflict.  Dirty hippie games put those faults up front and center, and then build play around them.  Bigtastic settings tend to plow a shipload of these fault lines right onto the beach, with the most intriguing ones often tucked away in a couple of throwaway lines of dense fictional history.  Digging out those gems while conveying enough of the setting to the group to ground everyone is the trick.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255368/#Comment_255368" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-07T05:37:41+00:00" title="February  7, 2010  5:37AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, what a great thread !! Okay, this is what I intend to publish this year : a (more or less, see below) giant detailed setting. What's the recipe ?<br/><br/>But first, couple of comments :<br/>- We (I mean in this thread) are talking about making a <i>good useful</i> product ; not making <i>a line of product</i> to generate money. I'm quite sure it is more <i>profitable</i> (if you can sell it) to have a player core book, a DM core book, a monster core book, a setting core book, adventures book and a lot of splat material.<br/>- I'm sure there are multiples ways to implant those "new types" of product. There is not a single solution.<br/>- We need to change paradigm. Those products will be new ; not only in term of content, but also in design. Below, I'm talking about a single product.<br/><br/>Recipe :<br/>- Never, never separate setting from plots. It does not exist a "plot-less setting".<br/>- Cease to think in term of "A vs B". Put a lot of factions. I mean A LOT.<br/>- Provide sparks, only sparks. I really mean it. Think in term of "one pager". But a lot of those. Anyway, you'll have a lot of factions and things going on, so stick to "no details". This is a 400 pages "one pager" book.<br/>- Link stuff in an "intuitive" way. It should be easy to navigate through the book.<br/>- Don't ask people to read it !!! See that big 400 pages setting ? Well open it, flip it, read some 20 pages and <i>voila</i> !!<br/>- Put a lot of different story-lines (read "story spark" there) in term of genre, but also length. You should be able to generate a single session game or very long campaign with the same product.<br/>- Aim at high replay value. Did I mention it ? High replay value. Each time you use the product, you'll use about 10 to 15%, so hope that people will want to explore the rest.<br/><br/>To simplify things I'd like to quote JoyWriter, from the forge, who summarize what I am trying to do (I stink so much at describing it myself) :<br/><i>Interesting, so presumably it's about making the world an active participant in the games, but in a more responsive way than the old metaplots? Creating sensitivity within the patterns of the story so that stuff rolls on, but also actions of the players naturally create their own story responses?</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LaughingJackWilton" title="LaughingJackWilton"><img alt="LaughingJackWilton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LaughingJackWilton">LaughingJackWilton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255379/#Comment_255379" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-07T09:09:12+00:00" title="February  7, 2010  9:09AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Avalanche looks simply brilliant.

The gazetteer approach, where the fluff provides a decent enough list of background material the GM can mine for story hooks is better, but I've always thought that it would be far more efficient if it was pared down to just the bullet points that could drive a story, no matter how interesting the detail actually is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

If there is more or less essential knowledge in a campaign, that is by virtue of a GM decision, not a design decision.  <i>This is one important reason having a GM is great.</i><br/><br/>Naturally this only applies to games with GMs where one person is responsible for deciding what is essential setting knowledge and what isn't.  In games where that power is shared, the responsibility is shared too.<br/><br/>If I stacked up everything ever written for the Forgotten Realms, it would be taller than I am.  I could design a game where virtually every page needed to be understood by the players, and I could design a game with two paragraphs out of one book in the middle of the list. But it's my decision as a GM, it has nothing to do with what the designer may have thought was a good campaign.  Indeed, I can pretty much guarantee every game I play is played in such a way as would make the designer scream and start crying and fall down on the floor sniveling - or worse, grit their teeth and mumble something like 'that sounds really interesting' all the while wanted to kill me, then themselves. <br/><br/>Should have another post up soon!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Queex" title="Queex"><img alt="Queex" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Queex">Queex</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255507/#Comment_255507" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-08T09:29:31+00:00" title="February  8, 2010  9:29AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 8, 2010 9:30AM by Queex.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>All games with a GM have every piece of setting information in the second category and none in the first, by virtue of the role of the GM as arbiter and creator of the setting for play.</blockquote>\nExcept that I can't think of any role-playing game that's written that way. It's certainly an interpretation you can apply, but all the setting-heavy books I can think of make the assumption that the GM will conform to the printed material as much as possible. If they are intended to be the latter, then they are simply badly written because they conceal the important story germs within irrelevant detail.<br/><br/>To take them as extensions to the basic information, as a resource to make the GM's job easier, supplemental books and sections are fine. If the material is just a weak suggestion, then you run the risk of a player assuming details that the GM has changed (and often this doesn't break the player knowledge/character knowledge barrier).<br/><br/>Some games even make important information with regards to character motivation and knowledge part of a massive, indigestible construct that has to be swallowed before play can begin (White Wolf, I'm looking in your direction). As such, it's an obstacle to play- where this happens I'd comfortably class it as a design flaw. Fortunately, it seems to be an unheard-of phenomenon in Indie RPGs, and a good thing too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255534/#Comment_255534" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-08T12:04:08+00:00" title="February  8, 2010 12:04PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Queex</cite>If they are intended to be the latter, then they are simply badly written because they conceal the important story germs within irrelevant detail.</blockquote>\nWhat I suspect our host would say to that is that it doesn't matter what the person who wrote the book intended, it only matters what you want in your game.<br/><br/>So if I pick up a 300-page Spelljammer setting book, but I ignore every single piece of information that the game writers clearly meant to be important in favor of one paragraph about bariaur society that gets me jazzed, then THAT become the "important" information for my game.<br/><br/>Mmm ... bariaurs....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255540/#Comment_255540" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-08T12:47:06+00:00" title="February  8, 2010 12:47PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Queex</cite>Oddly, I blogged recently about games with lots of setting.

The gazetteer approach, where the fluff provides a decent enough list of background material the GM can mine for story hooks is better, but I've always thought that it would be far more efficient if it was pared down to just the bullet points that could drive a story, no matter how interesting the detail actually is.</blockquote>\nI think this really strongly depends on a set of assumptions that tend not to be true for my big setting games.  Obviously, if you think of setting detail as useless dross, then you can improve "efficiency" by paring it down as far as it will go.  However, for many games I value that detail.  <br/><br/>So, for example, I don't think that my Korea game would have been improved if I set it up so that we could start playing without players knowing what Buddhism and Confucianism were - or even what the Taiping Rebellion was.  The backdrop and traditions were a part of the game, and while there was a lot of stuff that was detailed in play, there was still a certain amount detailed up front - more than a few bullet points.  Now, I could have started with almost no background knowledge, but I don't think it would have improved the game.  <br/><br/>If you don't want any of the detail at the start - only wanting to select out a paragraph or two or some bullet points, say - then I'd question whether you want to be getting into a giant detailed setting in the first place.  There's nothing wrong with simple setting games - that might be a better choice for that campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255584/#Comment_255584" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-08T16:49:19+00:00" title="February  8, 2010  4:49PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is one little thing that "buggers" me here.

One "major" event, you might know, is the attack of Nanjing (also called the rape of Nanjing). I've read something like 2000 pages on this, some comic books (yes, they exist on the subject and they are strange), I saw movies too. Now, can *someone* produce a rpg, providing enough *fluff* to play a campaign like this (with, by the way, some heavy moral dilemma) ? I guess so (now, would it be happy ? not quite sure. That said, you can take <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053114/" rel="nofollow">human condition</a> as another example, more happier, which requires a lot of background).

My interest is more on how to start with somehing like those resources, then boil it down to some form of presentation that is more geared towards a game, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>For example, how compressed could one make the necessary info, almost as a sort of cheat-sheet, to hand around to players? How could one use imagery to convey concepts? Also, even prior to getting into game mechanics, how does one convey the essence of the setting and the type of play either the GM or designer wants to encourage?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255622/#Comment_255622" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-08T19:44:47+00:00" title="February  8, 2010  7:44PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now I'm going to show you why gigantic setting books are good for more than just Oracles, randomly turning to a page and getting a situation from it.<br/><br/>The next thing you do once you have a basic concept and an idea of the conceptual layout of the game is you go trolling for ways to expand your concept.  This has several purposes:<br/><br/>1 - prophylactic.  You may get four sessions in and everyone stops the game to announce it is the worst game and nobody wants to play it anymore.  No problem.  You can then take the characters to do something else.  <br/><br/>2 - verisimilitude.  Sometimes it's good in stories to see a bit of slice-of-life not connected to the conflict.  It's important that it be a bit "off to the side", only visible in the wide view.<br/><br/>3 - complications.  Sometimes your players will solve a problem so fast that it throws off the pacing of the game and makes everything easy and boring.  Bringing in something from left field is a good way to re-ignite stories that have fallen into a rut.<br/><br/>4 - elements for the story.  A character that's neat, a plot that's ongoing, stuff like that.  Really you are so great you probably don't need this stuff but it never hurts, Moliere.<br/><br/>So let's go!<br/><br/>The first thing I do is I actually read the rest of the entry on P'Bapar, instead of just page 87.  <br/><br/>It says that it's a leader among the Young Kingdoms, that's interesting.  Maybe the players' decisions are emulated in other places and we can see how their strategies work out in other places.  <br/><br/>The Archduke prefers a small government, with lots of responsibilities loaded on very few people.  Interesting, what if one of these guys goes off the rails, or takes a disliking to the player characters?  That could mean that if they, for example, piss off one of the religious leaders, they might find their favorite inn is off limits to them, even though the two may not be otherwise connected.  Xkewl.<br/><br/>There's a couple of interesting dudes in the Mages &amp; Sages and Underworld section.  Of course I always love crime stories and put crime in everything, even if it doesn't belong.  I file these away under possible complications and move on.<br/><br/>A mile north of the city is Crag Keep, right on the border with someone or other.  Apparently they claim all the land around there but when trouble comes, they turn to P'Bapar.  That's a pretty good "someone is running into town carrying a torch screaming for any moron with a sword to come running" type of hook.<br/><br/>The next thing I do is go "up a level" to read about what the Young Kingdoms (of which P'Bapar is a leader) are.  This is back at the beginning of the chapter.  Not much to say there except they are newly independent and the faraway Emperor (whoever that is) is not thrilled about it.  Maybe some kind of Imperial spy comes in and fucks everything up.  Meh, all right, it's not knocking my socks off.<br/><br/>Next thing to do is actually look up what the dwarves and humans are like.  Way back in Chapter 1. Hm, looks like it's Brandobians?  I guess.  There's a pretty interesting ethnic diversity of humans there.  But it looks like dwarves are just dwarves.  Okay, fine.<br/><br/>Next thing is to check out what the Temples I was talking about earlier actually mean.  This is chapter 10.  And right away I am loving this list of gods, because even just in the header I'm seeing something cool about the gods of Kalamar. They're classified virtually all by what they do.  In other words, clerics on Kalamar are less worshipping because wow, they think the god is just so great, but instead because hey, people need to fight evil, counsel others, study the world, and so on, and this god is going to help everyone do that.  That is a cool and very practical thing.  <br/><br/>Oh hey wait, the players are going to have to know something about this setting before we even get to character creation.  OH NO JDCORLAY WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW<br/><br/>Find out in the next post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255627/#Comment_255627" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-08T20:08:00+00:00" title="February  8, 2010  8:08PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's been a lot of discussion in the thread about how to get information across to the players.  And whether you have to.  Blah blah blah.  Actually it's a good discussion and a good thread that deserves more than 'blah blah blah', I'll do something about that later. <br/><br/>Your job as GM is to sort the facts in the fiction into several categories:<br/><br/>1 - Stuff the players absolutely must know, one hundred percent have to know, before beginning play.<br/>2 - Stuff you can tell the players as you go along, and which they should remember because it is impractical or lame to tell them more than once.<br/>3 - Stuff you can tell the players as you go along, several times if need be, it's not an issue.<br/>4 - Stuff you can tell the players as you go along if it comes up.<br/>5 - Stuff you  never need to tell the players unless they specifically charge after that fact with an axe.<br/><br/>How do you decide this?  Well, it's not an exact science and it's going to take some practice.  You are going to misfile some facts at various times. But here are some good guidelines.<br/><br/><i>Know what your players consider "fair".</i>  If you play Houses of the Blooded and say "You've cornered the killer. He says 'did it work? Do they think you're chasing me?'" and they go "Haha, fuck yeah, I'm working with the killer!" then you can hide the ball a lot more than if they go "What, no, fuck you, that goes against the entire motivation of my character!"<br/><br/>In the example I gave above, with a bunch of hippies who are used to story games, they are pretty used to games where sudden new facts are "revealed".  That's good, it means you can put more facts into 3 and 4.  <br/><br/>Sometimes you have a player who really wants a lot of details before they make decisions about where they want to go in the setting.  That's good too, you can put facts in 1 and 3.  <br/><br/>Sometimes you have a player who is going to make the same type of character no matter what game you're playing. That's good, you can put more in 4.<br/><br/>Everything in 1 goes on handouts and is addressed in your opening briefing about the campaign and the characters.  Everything in 2 goes on handouts and you don't worry about it until you have to hand it out.  You are the controller of everything in 3-5.<br/><br/><i>You must be up front with the players about what you expect from them.</i>  If I want people in my Kalamar game to be able to pronounce "P'Bapar" (try it!), I not only need to tell them how to pronounce it, I need to tell them I expect them to pronounce it properly.  <br/><br/>Sometimes you will get players who don't even want to read a one-sheet - your "1" facts, above.  These players are telling you they don't want to play in your game!  Listen to them! Don't make them play in your game!<br/><br/>Now you have some additional responsibility here as well.  Sometimes the reason players don't want to read or pay attention to a one-sheet of material is because they've played in so many games where that material is boring or lame or just so badly categorized that the GM made the material they were expected to learn completely irrelevant - like if I started pronouncing "P'Bapar" wrong after hammering everyone to pronounce it right.<br/><br/>This is why you have to practice this sorting task until you master it, so they can trust that what you're doing is actually going to matter to them.<br/><br/>Next....the Player Who Loves Kalamar joins my game!

The nerve of the war is <i>selling out the right content to the right person</i>.

If, say, there is one set of users who only use detailed gazeteer information, and another set who only use detailed history information -- then I think you might do well to have a supplement only about history and keep the history in the core setting book short.  If there are some things that only a few users would want (or only a few users don't want) - then you should play to the majority.  You can't please everyone all the time.  <br/><br/>In my experience of Harn and other settings, though, players didn't vary so much on the type of detail they wanted - but more on how much detail they wanted.  Thus, the approach was to have a detailed but not super-detailed core book, and then a lot of add-on modules.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pells</cite>Another question, by the way : let's say I'm playing an historical period for the sake of discovering (exploring) the true meaning of Confucianism (or economy breakdown), is a rpg book really the best resource ? Or shouldn't this book give something to<i>play</i>and show me toward some good place for historical references ?</blockquote>\nIn my experience, adult history books tend to suck at providing information needed for an RPG.  They tend to be macro-histories that discuss the chains of events with kings and armies, and give little idea about what life was like.  Children's history books are often better at illustrating what daily life was like - but daily life is different than the lives of player characters.  So yes, in principle, I think that an RPG book can in principle be a very good resource - though there are many examples of poorly done historical RPG books (as well as some good ones).  <br/><br/>However, I don't think my point about the Korea campaign was limited to real-world history.  The point is that extra details can change the tone of a campaign considerably.  <br/><br/>i.e. I could indeed run a 19th century Korea game with little to no background knowledge.  The players could just play off of familiar Asian tropes from different martial arts films, and we could create characters quickly and get on with playing the campaign.  However, I assert that this creates a very different experience than if the players learn some about Confucianism and mudangs and the Taiping Rebellion first.  <br/><br/>In the same way, one can start up a campaign set in Harn with no particular background knowledge.  However, it is very different from playing in a game where you know the background.  So, my first Harn PC was a priest of Agrik, and it made considerable difference when I knew about the Morgathian theocracy that had been thrown down decades earlier.  My conception of my character was very different than if I just went with a quickie summary of Agrik as "evil fire god."  His whole view of life was shaped to a degree by the evils that he felt he was fighting against.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JAR" title="JAR"><img alt="JAR" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JAR">JAR</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255693/#Comment_255693" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T06:08:46+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  6:08AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the idea that most adult history books are "macro-histories" is probably true of popular historical works, but diplomatic/social histories of this sort have not been the primary sorts of works produced by most historians for some time.

I bet some of your players will too!  I would love to play in a game sometime where the explicit expectation was "read and learn this 300 page history book about the era we are playing in", with a group of people who have done just that.  Naturally if someone hates doing that, they will never like studying up on a setting presented in that way.<br><br>Most of the "birds eye view" histories of kings and whatnot are still pretty decent for coming up with conflicts the player characters can get dealt into, though.  In fact, the vast majority of fictional settings are presented in this way in RPGs. Oddly, one of the most vivid exceptions was the Netherworld of Feng Shui, an action movie inspired game - the source material's setting information is at MOST a single title card at the beginning of a film!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>HAY JAYDEECORLAY, isn't all that stuff in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23110&amp;Mode=like">#110</a> rather similar to how the 4E Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide is organized?</blockquote>\nI'm going to have to take a look at it again when I get home.

I try to combine text, verbal discussion and the occasional illustration or tactile exercise ("Now, hand the fan mail chip to Ryan.") Writing a one-sheet isn't easy, because you have to be concise and conciseness is very hard.  Also, as I noted, it's not easy to figure out what goes on a one-sheet, it takes practice and knowledge about your group and the game you intend to run.  It's very rare that, for example, you do a cheat sheet for a convention game that hits one hundred percent of the things that people need to know to play, because the players are going to be strangers to you.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Queex</cite><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>All games with a GM have every piece of setting information in the second category and none in the first, by virtue of the role of the GM as arbiter and creator of the setting for play.</blockquote>\nExcept that I can't think of any role-playing game that's written that way. It's certainly an interpretation you can apply, but all the setting-heavy books I can think of make the assumption that the GM will conform to the printed material as much as possible. If they are intended to be the latter, then they are simply badly written because they conceal the important story germs within irrelevant detail.<br/><br/>I disagree - unless the setting book somehow changes the role of the GM in the game, the GM's responsibility in the rules as the person who adjudicates, introduces, and controls setting remains.  And indeed, as I said in the first post of this thread, it is absolutely impossible to use every fact in a big setting book, or even a relatively modest one, in a game.  It's trivial to recognize that impossibility and a GM is empowered by the rules of the game to act accordingly.<br/><br/>Interestingly, there is viirtually no help in most big thick setting books, or even modest ones, on how to use the book.  Not "stick as close to you can to the printed material!" or "change the printed material a lot, it will be great!", typically you will get absolutely nothing.  In Kingdoms of Kalamar, there is literally zero, not one word, not one paragraph, nothing that says "Hey, GM, welcome, glad you're reading our book, here's what you should be looking for in order to make a great game."  This is terrible, and it's terrible that our dumb industry hasn't figured out that "how to use this book in a campaign" is the most important text you can put in a book even if it's a setting book, perhaps especially if it's a setting book.<br/><br/>I'll talk about the Player Who Loves Kalamar, which you also brought up, in my next post. You're right, it can be problematic sometimes, but rarely as much as people think. I used to rant and rail about how bad metaplots were, myself. What if a player joined my group who wanted things to be some other way, what then?! Stay tuned. <br/><br/>Hexabolic posted about "splats". I'll talk about supplemental setting material later too, but Hex more or less has the right of it. There's typically just plain no difference between supplemental setting material and big thick book setting material except where the game company decided to insert covers and time in between it.  You have to find what is relevant to what you want to do, just as you would in the main setting book, or in the real world.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255698/#Comment_255698" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T06:56:41+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  6:56AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD:<br/>How do you feel about going a different rout and using a very controlled, very focussed one-shot as an intro instead of other methods of imparting initial info?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255779/#Comment_255779" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T12:13:45+00:00" title="February  9, 2010 12:13PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The question wasn't addressed to me, but I'll throw in anyway: I love tightly controlled, highly focused one-shots as ways of imparting important information, although I haven't tried it as an intro (as either a GM or a player).<br/><br/>But it's been used in our games as a way to "make in-game history fun" -- making the one-shot a window into some historical event that relates to the current plot, so that instead of the players getting a handout or a lecture from the GM to tell them about the Rock Creek Massacre, they actually got to be part of that Massacre.  This worked out spectacularly in a horror game -- when the ancient evil was on the verge of waking, we went back and played through the fateful night back in Colonial times when it last awoke, and when we came back to the "real" game, no one needed to be lectured on how terrible it was or forgot the names of the families whose vicious blood feud released it.<br/><br/>I don't see why it couldn't work as an intro just as well.  For example, if you were going to play <b>Cheech &amp; Gimli</b> in Kingdoms of Kalamar, you could probably reinforce some of the most important type-1 and type-2 temple facts and important dwarf information via play, and get better name- and fact-recognition than from just a pre-game lecture and a handout.  By the time you hit the actual campaign, the story of the temple's founding or how the dwarf army successfully held off a monster invasion would be something that everyone "just knows" and might actually have some feelings about (bitterness towards the rival temple, reverence for their fallen heroes, whatever).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255810/#Comment_255810" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-09T15:26:46+00:00" title="February  9, 2010  3:26PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow !!!

How is the world around the group going to evolve ? How to you provide the information ? Manage it ?<br/>You see the difference between "in this world we're playing, those two nations are at war" and "in the course of the campaign, those two nations will come to war" ?<br/>It is not only about <i>which</i> information to provide, but also <i>when</i> to provide it.<br/><br/><b>Accounting for taste</b><br/>I like your idea of "teaser" ; this could do a good job.

Most of the time, the actual number of setting elements you can get across in a campaign of average length is very limited (if you have 30 sessions, you're probably introducing less than 200 things of any sort to the fiction, including things that wouldn't be classified as setting), and many of them can be introduced and explained by you in the moment without losing any of their impact, so you don't need to teach the setting to them completely before the first act of play. But if you don't feel that way about a game there's absolutely nothing wrong with saying "gang, this game is in part about existing in this highly detailed setting and I want you to read 300 pages before we start playing". Just make sure they know you're not joking and it's not optional. They can walk if they don't want to participate, and should.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256022/#Comment_256022" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-10T15:11:43+00:00" title="February 10, 2010  3:11PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So basically, it all boils down to "have the right group and lots of time".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256031/#Comment_256031" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-10T15:54:25+00:00" title="February 10, 2010  3:54PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...then again, "have the right group and lots of time" tends to be a winning formula for a lot of games, doesn't it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256035/#Comment_256035" name="Item_124" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-10T16:17:25+00:00" title="February 10, 2010  4:17PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, it is.

Talk together as a group, throw out some ideas and see what people like.  Be prepared to try a setting that might not be your first choice if deciding alone.  If you have a bunch of history buffs, then consider a historical game.  If you have fans of Tolkien or Zelazny or some media series, then consider that.  If everyone considers detail dull and can't stand the idea of reading about any setting - then maybe a giant detailed setting isn't the right choice for this group.  <br/><br/>2) Agree as a group how you want to approach the setting.  i.e. What supplements would you use, and how prepared should people be before starting the campaign.  This doesn't have to be a GM decision that the players either accept or walk away from.  Almost all settings can be done in higher or lower detail.  <br/><br/>3) Your group doesn't need a ton of free time - just be prepared for start-up to take multiple sessions.  Consider taking more than one session for everyone to get together, brainstorm, and talk about the setting along with campaign and character ideas.  This isn't a "failed" or "wasted" session - it's a time to make some snacks, have fun, and hang out with friends.  I had a movie night where we watched the movie "Blood Rain" with my group before the Korea campaign, and talked about it afterwards.  After that, we had a campaign and character creation session.  <br/><br/>4) Running a one-shot with pre-generated characters in the setting can be a good idea. If you're trying to introduce the setting, then a focus on places in the adventure is a good idea.  I'm doing this with Castle Falkenstein.  <br/><br/>5) Make sure everyone has copies of the books.  A lot of people have free time to read even if you have time scheduling game sessions.  <br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neil</cite>I'd like to highlight the point jhkim's making, because it's one I'm interested in hearing addressed and I think it's getting lost.<br/><br/>Paring down a large setting to a few facts that fit on a one-sheet is fine, but what do you do when that cuts out much of what makes the setting interesting?

If players don't understand what this culture is all about, and make sure it's part of the game and their characters, they'll be missing out on a lot of the fun.<br/><br/>How do you get players on board with this kind of game?</blockquote>\nI partly disagree here, because I think it's more about how the setting is done than familiarity.  Most kinds of settings could be done as high detail, or could be done as low detail.  For example, Harn is definitely medieval fantasy - and you could potentially approach it as just another fantasy world (i.e. "we all kind of know how medieval fantasy people think").  But there is a kind of fun that you miss out on if you ignore the detail.  I think this is also true of historical - i.e. Victorian London is a mildly familiar culture, but you can do it as a sketchy, low-detail setting where you just play off a few stereotypes - or you can read up on fine points of detail regarding what people were really like then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256495/#Comment_256495" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-13T12:44:26+00:00" title="February 13, 2010 12:44PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so my game has been such a success that I've attracted a new player who is SO PSYCHED ABOUT KALAMAR. He's read every Kalamar book and knows every page. He knows Kalamar far better than I do.  And he wants to play in the game! <br/><br/>It is very easy to snigger at this guy, or to somehow blame him.  But it is not his fault he loves Kalamar.  Love doesn't come to us and we take it or turn it away, it comes on us like a sickness, a surge of passion and we are caught forever.  It's this way with me and Sherlock Holmes, it's this way with this guy and Kalamar.<br/><br/>The real issue is that of authority.  Whether there's GM-led or shared narration authority, someone who knows more about a subject can rightly get upset when the authority directs that things go opposite to what their knowledge indicates things should go.  And authority can get exasperated when it's being corrected all the time by someone who thinks they know more.<br/><br/>It gets worse when the person who has the knowledge doesn't have the authority.  In a GM-led game, for example, something someone says can be a lie or the truth or in some grey zone.  The whole conversation can be a dream or a hallucination.  To have someone nitpick a conversational or descriptive detail can bring the whole game to a halt.<br/><br/>So here's what you do.<br/><br/>First, recognize the person with the greater knowledge.  Talk to them separately from the rest of the group.  "How do you see Kalamar? How do you see this area of Kalamar? What do you think of my game pitch?  Is there something else you think would be cool to work in?"  Listen closely to the answers.  You are likely to learn something that you missed - after all, it's a big detailed setting, you're going to miss something.  Shoot down an idea, there'll be at least one you don't want to do.  See how they respond.  Make a firm stand on what you see your game as.  And if they start to nitpick that idea, listen to that too - <i>they are telling you they don't want to play in your game</i>.  It doesn't fit their idea of the subject they love.  <br/><br/>Secondly, assuming that goes well, recruit them into explaining things to other participants.  During character creation, have them help one person while you help another.  Suggest that they play a widely-travelled character who can explain situations to the other characters, reducing your explanatory narration and "what do I know about this?" rolls.<br/><br/>Finally and most importantly, have clear in your own mind what you see as your role and their role.  The main problem comes when you say "The walls are 60 feet high" and the guy who loves Kalamar says "No, they're only 45 feet high" and neither you nor he are willing to give.  This is a role-at-the-table issue, NOT an issue of big detailed settings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256498/#Comment_256498" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-13T13:28:10+00:00" title="February 13, 2010  1:28PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Okay, so my game has been such a success that I've attracted a new player who is SO PSYCHED ABOUT KALAMAR.

One of the players was as big a WW2 buff as me and I utilized his knowledge in much the way you described. Since we had that understanding of roles and he realized I was making an effort to "get it right" he didn't nitpick and I frequently called on him to explain something to the other members of the group when the situation warranted. He got the opportunity to display his knowledge and love of the material and we all got added color.<br/><br/>Worked out great!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256763/#Comment_256763" name="Item_131" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-16T09:09:59+00:00" title="February 16, 2010  9:09AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I hope the thread has been useful. In conclusion, here are all the great things about big setting books for story games:<br/><br/>1 - Verisimilitude.  What John Kim has elsewhere called a "non-fiction" style of story play.  Extremely thorough guidance on what details in the setting are like.<br/><br/>2 - Extremely Broad Application.  A large number of groups looking for a lot of different things are well-served by a product that gives a lot of different ideas for different ways to use the material.<br/><br/>3 - Setting Mastery.  Fans of big brick fantasy novels know what I'm talking about here - the pleasure of recognizing something in a setting you already knew when you see it for the first time. Actually this is kinda like <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, but incorporates the expertise of the players as well.<br/><br/>Remember that initial principle: you can't possibly use every part of a big setting book and it's inadvisable to try.<br/><br/>And remember that if you want to write a giant setting book, give ideas and instructions on how to use the material.<br/><br/>I think I got all the questions...but if I missed yours, it's been a big thread, please post 'em again and I'll answer all of them 100 percent perfectly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256813/#Comment_256813" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-16T12:38:33+00:00" title="February 16, 2010 12:38PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think another great thing about Big Setting Books is this:<br/><br/>You allow people at the table with different levels of investment. That is, you tell the folks "We're playing Kalamar" (or Dark Sun, Blue Planet, Continuum, etc) and if you utilize the information above, you can bring people into the setting who only need to read 1-2 pages of pre-play information to "get it". Meanwhile, if one or more of your members has the free time and interest in reading more (read: "all of it, everywhere"), then they too have an equal seat at the table: Their level of investment can also be rewarded, and you can even draw on them (as Mike M indicates above) to help with explanations.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256830/#Comment_256830" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-16T13:34:43+00:00" title="February 16, 2010  1:34PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, the key strength of a giant detailed setting is that it allows richer communication of meaning.  <br/><br/>If I say "You see a Buddhist monk on the road." in the 19th century Korea game, or "You see an Peonian priest on the road." in a Harn game -- then I have communicated much more about the situation than I would have if I was running a low-detail setting saying "You see the priest of a peaceful religion on the road."  This richness of meaning translates to all levels, so you've always got a lot of layers of meaning that are built up in situations.  <br/><br/>When done well, that detailed meaning isn't just dross that makes the game more believable - it adds depth to the events of the story.  When my Agrikan character argues with the Peonian priest, there are all sorts of thematic allusions and ties that wouldn't be there if we didn't know anything about the religions of the world.  That detail can prevent you from telling some simple iconic stories - but conversely it can lets you tell stories about detailed issues that you couldn't otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256847/#Comment_256847" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-16T14:15:11+00:00" title="February 16, 2010  2:15PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2010 2:17PM by Brian_Minter.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Jason.
