<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>What I don't get is, aside from a desperate need to feel that your choices are validated by everyone else liking exactly what you like, why the fuck is it so hard for RPers to honestly say, "Well heck, that's not what I like, but if it works for you then awesome!"</blockquote>
Okay, fess up.  What parts of gaming out there are not what you like, but you have nothing but praise and encouragement for the folks who do pursue it?<br/><br/>For me, the Number One item is Immersion.  It <em>fascinates</em> me that folks get so into the experience and into their characters that that constitutes the primary enjoyment of the game for them.  And it totally, manifestly, profoundly doesn't work for me that way.  But I love hearing about it, and I want to learn how to design for it better.<br/><br/>Also on my list:<br/><br/>The Hardcore Setting.  Not "oh, we are hardcore setting junkies, grrr."  No, I mean Warhammer and Rifts and the like.  The settings that I swear had to be inked in testosterone.  I so don't get it; playing it so doesn't interest me.  But you know, I love hearing about some guy talking about killing vampires with his glitterboy.<br/><br/>Fantasy.  Seriously, I think I have forgotten how to appreciate the fantasy genre any more.  It doesn't compute.  But I see that other folks dig it, so rock your bad selves out.                </div>

And also, travel routes, distances, etc.  I had a game of Serenity basically get ruined for me because we were focusing on how much fuel we had to get where we were going.<br/><br/>As far as why people can't just say "awesome, but not for me!" I mean, I <i>can</i> say it, but I feel weird doing so.  I feel like I'm being disingenuous.  If I don't like something, I want to just say, "I don't like it."  I don't feel it's awesome.  The best I can muster is something like, "I can see how some people might enjoy X, but it doesn't work for me."  I think it might be just one of my many character flaws which compels me to sometimes be too honest for politeness.                        </div>

                            Rob, are there things that just don't push your buttons but you can understand, on some intellectual level, that they push others' buttons, and you can sort of see how, even though it doesn't work for you?<br/><br/>Cause like: olives, man.  I can't stand the taste and texture of olives.  But on the rare occasions that I resolve to try one to see if I still don't like them, I can taste the subtleties and flavors that other people like.

                            Yeah, the same way some people think beer is just dirty water.  Like that.  Or the way I feel about most wines.<br/><br/>For me personally: hardcore hard choices/face-stabbing games.  Like, they're cool, but I've played SO MANY of them since I started hanging out with the indie roleplaying crowd.  And yet people produce more every year.  There's more to roleplaying, even more to Forge-style Narrativism, than hard choices and face-stabbing.  But clearly some folks think it's the bees knees and will stab me in the face now.                        </div>

Joshua, yes to the first part, no to the second.  And in both cases, to the extent that I can attain some kind of understanding, it is an intellectualized thing, not a felt thing.  That is, I can logically work out that there are people who enjoy these things (that's actually fairly easy), and if provided with an explanation of why someone enjoys such a thing, I might be able to comprehend it, but I can't force myself to taste the olive and appreciate it.<br/><br/>(I also hate olives.)                        </div>

                            Jonathan, I'm not familiar with the buzzwords you're using, but I have a feeling that one of them is about player vs.  player conflicts.  I'm sort of with you, if I understand you.  I really feel uncomfortable when I'm in a PC-vs-PC situation though they seem to be extremely popular in indie gaming.  I think I get why.  It's another way to offload story-momentum to the entire table, rather than having it all rest in the GM's hands.  It can be a quick route to thematically rich play.  But this is definitely one of those things, the taste for which I have to have people explain to me.                        </div>

                            Jonathan, I hear what you're saying, but I'm wondering if you can give me more examples of non-hard choices Narrativist Male Yonger play.  If I understand Secret Forge Moon Language correctly, the point of Narrativist Male Yonger play is to arrive at a thematic statement.  And if I understand thematic statements, they're often along the lines of "(Making this choice) leads to (this consequence)".  Like, I guess sometimes it can be an easy choice:  if you eat pie, you'll be happy--but I'm not up on this stuff, and I was wondering what you had in mind.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>"Not what I like, but awesome" is incompatible with my usage of "awesome."</blockquote>
(EDIT: Cross-posted this with Mark W)<br/><br/>As for me, I can totally see "Not what I like, but awesome", with one caveat: <b>It's a very fine line between the honest sentiment that "I like hearing accounts of it even though it's not my bag" and the dishonest technique of pseudo-innocuously bringing up concepts that you don't like and taking them to task (iow, 'being patronizing or condescending')</b>. No one's crossed that line yet, but I just wanted to throw that out there. Also, it would help if you are thorough in your reasoning behind why you think it's awesome, so people don't automatically assume that you're being condescending. Come up with stuff you don't like that you STILL think is Awesome, not things that "you just don't like" and make a hand-wavey gesture of saying something "nice" about it. Awesome is awesome, so tell us why.<br/><br/>For me, here's some non-gaming stuff:<br/>Fantasy Football. I have no interest in the sport of football (the only sports I watch are the bizarre ones like Sumo, Badminton and Full-Contact Karate). I never participated in the "office pools" of yesteryear, but I've noticed that those office pools ('which team will win?') have been replaced by this deep, strategic social game of Fantasy Football. When I hear my coworkers talk about it, it seriously sounds like the exploits of two dudes playing Warhammer, complete with building their armies. But I have no idea who the big players or teams are, so I cannot participate (and I'm not interested enough to learn). But I do LOVE to hear tales of the flow of tactics and choices between the various folks in my office.<br/><br/>Now, gaming stuff:<br/>* I'm with Jonathan on the face-stabby thing.  For the folks wondering what J-Dogg was talking about, I think he's talking about those games where you are basically encouraged to be put into a situation where your character indulges in machinations against the other characters, usually in a way that involves eventual ruin and death, or where every conflict is high stakes. Like The Mountain Witch, Cold City, Polaris if you squint your eyes, Sorcerer (not by necessity, just by habit), AMBER, etc.  It looks like Jonathan is looking for games that aren't so "big Big BIG" in terms of stakes, and don't implicitly encourage you to gak your fellow protagonists, even if the PLAYERS are totally down with that, going "Damn, dude, that was awesome the way you killed my dude's girlfriend and ruined his life, forcing him to commit suicide. That rocked!" Also, see "All of Luke Crane's convention demos" :-)<br/><br/>I like high stakes fast-to-the-conflict play and character-gakking when everyone is on the same page. But not all the time. There's some folks out there that seem to love it all the time, and that seems to be the only way they play. Which again, rocks, because if you've played these types of games it takes some excellent skills to keep on your feet, come up with awesome ideas quickly, and also separate yourself from your character so you don't get beat up when your character does.  But I don't like playing that type of game more than once in say, every five games or so. I tend to prefer games where the players are protagonists, and aside from key moments, tend to work loosely like a team.<br/><br/>... I'm trying to think of something else that I don't like that I think is awesome (and not just that "I don't like it") but I'm having trouble. I'll leave it there for now, and join in again when I eventually think of something else.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            There isn't a way. It is condescending. The most decorous thing to do is to ignore what you don't like. But this is the Internet which is about as decorous as a knife fight in a toxic waste dump. Not a modern day toxic waste dump either, one of the ones from the 60s where they just threw the barrels over a wall and wondered idly what was on the other side.                        </div>

                            Andy, I'm totally with you on fantasy football. It sounds like a lot of fun. Like I have this notion that if I <i>were</i> into that, I could lay the smack down with my gamer-fu, and even toss out pointers and strategies which would build guy esteem. (I did this once by cluing some fantasy footballers in to the notion they could get stats off the internet, before it was ubiquitous.) But I don't give the slightest fuck about football, so it's like some weird anthropological exercise.                        </div>

                            I guess in my case, it's not so much, "It's not for me but it's awesome," as "it's not for me, but I totally respect your mad skillz in that department."  Like, a friend of mine is the kind of guy who wants to know what the gross national product of all the nations in the game are.  I could care less, but that's the kind of guy he is, and I get a lot of enjoyment out of watching him do what he does.  Similarly, I don't have a whole lot of interest in hardcore player vs. player machinations, but I still like hearing stories about who doublecrossed who.                        </div>

                            this really doesn't have to do with much role playing as much as it did a while back, but miniatures painting and construction.  i marvel at the little scenery, and sort of with that, old school war games.  i'm not really a big war game fan, but i like looking at the stuff.  just like civil war reinacting, i wouldn't have the passion to do it, but think it's very cool thing for those that do.<br/>-Nate                        </div>

                            Clearly designed, functional and transparent rules for roleplaying games are awesome, but not what I like. It's the moment when you read a game and think "okay, I see how this works" or even when you test out the rules, see that they do work, and still the game leaves you cold.<br/><br/>I have plenty of games that give me kind of intellectual gratification but can't really imagine myself playing them. Then again, I have even more games that don't give me the gratification and I wouldn't run them either.<br/><br/>Same goes for LARP's; reading about a cleverly designed, rules-involved short larp is cool, but I don't think I'd like to participate.                        </div>

                            As to why I would say, "I don't like it but think its awesome" and why I'd want to and why it isn't condescending -- because I'm a student of humanities, and I love the glorious diversity of humanity. I celebrate the fact that we are different, I revel in it, I embrace and enjoy it. <br/><br/>I've spent a huge part of my life studying religions that I do not believe, but that does not mean I do not respect or admire them, that because I do not personally believe them means I think anything less about those that do. I can't think of anything that would have made my life poorer for having ignored, say Hinduism or Islam, or refusing to talk about them because they are not my religion, my ritual, or my little corner of the world. I do not believe that Brahman is Atman, but I can see the wonder and potential and beauty in the idea -- even though it is not my thing. <br/><br/>In a much, much smaller and much, much less important way I think the same about the different ways people approach games and fun and telling stories. Just because they do something differently than I do does not mean that I cannot celebrate them, and just because I tell them that what they are doing is awesome does not mean I am patronizing them. I think the world, even just the pathetic little world of RPGs, is bigger than I am and I WANT IT TO BE BIGGER THAN I AM. <br/><br/>I can think of nothing sadder or more pathetic than a world in which everyone played the way I play, or did only things that I thought were awesome for me. I cannot even conceive of why I would want to be so bound up in my own narrow paradigm that I was unable to see the value in people who do things differently than I do. And because I want there to be more than my philosophy, I will tell others that I can see the cool in what they do, even if it is not my cool. Beginning neglect and "'don't ask/don't tell" are not good enough if we want to actually support communities of difference rather than just communities of indifference.  <br/><br/>As for things that I see mass Awesome in that are not my thing: <br/><br/>Immersion: I play with immersives a lot, and have talked with even more. I find the ability to subsume into character to be fascinating, and have found that if its supported with a play structure amenable to it that it can make the game experience much richer for everyone at the table. I, however, can't do it. I've tried, and I just can't do it. Nor do I think it would get me, personally, what I want out of game even if I could. <br/><br/>Highly Constrained Games: I do like my games to have some limits, but if you give me an overly constrained game I will start to chafe under the limitations. However, I have seen that these games can work for a lot of people -- especially non-RPers getting into RP. The ability to have a very narrow focus, to zero in on and perfect one thing, to have a simple and straight forward mechanical play structure that allows for an easy mental model of how to do something (tell a story, have an adventure, whatever) can do amazing things to bring joy to those who don't need to be a free bird or a unique snowflake.<br/><br/>Boffer LARPs: Once upon a time I was interested in these things. But I gained the same problem I had with MUSHes, they didn't give me story, and I am story's whore. But the way that people get into these things, the effort they put into costumes and latex weapons, to creating a full and fully interactive world of fantasy and physical martial contests is something to behold. I can totally see why people get into the dirt and the struggle and the joyfully whacking away at each other, trying really hard to land the killing blow. <br/><br/>Con Games: Sorry guys, but con game are a mild form of diversion for me, a chance to maybe see something new in action lke a pony prancing before the judges. I don't get the emotional, personal connection from them that I get from my "real" games. But, I totally see the point of con games. Getting out there and trying new things, meeting new people, getting a chance to put a game through its paces, to do things your normal group might not want to... that's all awesome. It just doesn't work out for me as being any more fun than playing Snap. Of course, I'm more than willing to have my mind changed about this one.                        </div>

Brand, even as little as a year ago, I would have said that. However, as far as I can tell, the actual facts on the ground in the world of RPGs is that people will <i>take it as patronizing</i> no matter how genuinely I mean it. It is just plain more polite to keep it to myself when I think something somebody else does is awesome, because odds are that I don't understand it well enough to make an insider feel like I respect it.                        </div>

                            Mark, <br/><br/>I can't control how people take things. Especially not in a world where there is so much snark and crap that it's impossible to tell sometimes who is really celebrating and who is patronizing. So I'm going to keep saying what I mean and what I think in the hopes that eventually it'll get through. <br/><br/>I mean, I've had some problems with it too, so you're not alone there. But I've also had some pretty amazing breakthroughs with people by saying it and sticking with it, especially when I admit to ignorance and ask questions and really try. (A lot of people have some ability to, over time, figure out if you're really trying to understand by the kinds of questions that you ask. Especially in the divide between explain what you do and justify what you do -- something a lot of questioners mess up on.) Sometimes sticking with it for years has been neccesary. Sometimes it hasn't worked at all. Many times, however, its paid off in the end.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>However, as far as I can tell, the actual facts on the ground in the world of RPGs is that people will <i>take it as patronizing</i> no matter how genuinely I mean it. It is just plain more polite to keep it to myself when I think something somebody else does is awesome, because odds are that I don't understand it well enough to make an insider feel like I respect it.</blockquote>
Enabling and rewarding a culture of pervasive insecurity is not what I'm personally into, but... <br/><br/>Actually I am kind of on the fence on this issue sometimes. I don't think either side has found the magic sauce that wil actually improve matters.                        </div>

                            Read a certain amount of personal burnout into my perspective on this - I've been putting a good deal of effort into learning to appreciate stuff that's not my personal cup of tea ove the last couple years of my gaming career, and as far as I can tell, all I've been succeeding in doing is alienating people.                        </div>

                            Pre-determined meaning, or (to some extent) even <i>axes of meaning</i> don't really do very much for me.  I feel like I have the same problem with them that people have with pre-narrated outcomes in conflict resolution.  I much prefer a system that lets me play out conflicts and then go back to find out what subtle nuances of meaning might have been discovered.<br/>

I get that authoring this stuff up-front can allow you to explore questions about XYZ question, but ... well ... I personally don't find that it really does that all that well.  But obviously people are having fun with it, so good for them.                        </div>

                            Jeff, <br/><br/>There isn't any reason to like everything that is on offer. I know there are a lot of things in our world and in our little world, that I find unhealthy, bad, annoying, or just fucked up. I'm not saying I don't ever pass negative judgment, because I sure as fuck do. <br/><br/>So it isn't about liking everything, its about being able to say that there is something good or substantive about some things that you don't like personally. Two different ideas that often get conflated.                        </div>

Dude, not you at all. Honestly, my online experience has been way better than my in-person, people I actually (used to) play with, experience. But I do think there's really not any clearly unproblematic way to do it - think ethnography, and how fraught that is.                        </div>

                            I have an interesting case.  I have never enjoyed Sorcerer at the level most people do.  My best Sorcerer stuff has always been Judd's Mu games, but even then it's more for the setting than the rules.  When playing that game I always feel like I can never succeed.  It may just be that I've had terrible luck, though.                        </div>

                            Just as a little follow-up and rationale for my thread here, over at <a href="http://nerdsocal.com" rel="nofollow">NerdSoCal.com</a> we are building a community.  Members of that community come from many different places, and have different likes and dislikes.  The goal of NerdSoCal is not to build up some giant edifice of consensus; it's to create a place where people who do agree and who enjoy the same things can connect and run off to do that thing.  As the head cheerleader on that site, a great deal of what I do is welcoming people in and telling them that this is a place where they can let their hair down about their nerdy hobbies.  So needless to say, there's all sorts of guys who are all into d20, or the techie brigade, or the Ren Faire folks, who are all into stuff that I'm just not.  But that doesn't mean that I can't see the appeal or appreciate that it's a thing that brings them enjoyment.  Maybe it's just something about me, but I can't help but stand up and cheer when somebody finds something that brings them joy.  And that's the sort of vibe that I'm trying to build over there -- of welcoming and mutual respect, rather than indifferent tolerance.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>of welcoming and mutual respect, rather than indifferent tolerance</blockquote>
JBR, your phrasing reminded me of something.<br/><br/>In NZ, there is a man called Ahmed Zaoui who was granted refugee status, but then locked up indefinitely, without trial, because he was suspected of being a terrorist. He was a member of the deposed government of Algeria, which was more or less the basis for both decisions. Some people I know were involved with campaigning for him to either receive a fair trial or be released, and the latter eventually happened (though with restrictions on his movements).<br/><br/>All that is background and only relevant inasmuch as it casts light on <a href="http://cityside.org.nz/node/87" rel="nofollow">this short talk</a> he gave last year about moving from tolerance to inclusion. He's a Muslim religious scholar speaking in a Christian church, and a refugee speaking in a foreign country, and he's saying, "I don't want to be tolerated here, I want to be included. I want our children to play together and be friends. We're different, fine, but there's a lot we have in common; let's start there."                        </div>

                            Exactly, Mike.  It's the difference between the very passive "tolerance" or "acceptance" and the more active "welcoming" and "inclusion."                        </div>
