Yes, <b>Fiasco</b> is designed to produce a <i>collaborative story-telling</i> experience. On the other hand, <b>Deadlands</b> can easily be run as <i>sequential play</i>, <i>fish tank</i>, or <i>sandbox</i>. Many traditional games are surprisingly silent on how to structure a game.<br/><br/>I am also curious if anyone has an example of a <i>bang driven</i> game, as that isn't a term I've heard before.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438380/#Comment_438380" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-16T10:24:15+00:00" title="September 16, 2014 10:24AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The term "Bangs" comes from Ron Edwards's Sorcerer. It's a very effective technique that's used by a lot of "story gamers" or games. Something like Monsterhearts comes to mind, although it isn't particularly explicit in this regard (and Apocalypse World is similar).<br/><br/>I'm not sure I agree with Rickard's strict definitions, however - like you say, they are all techniques which might be applied in different ways.<br/><br/>If I was running a "bang-driven game", for instance, I would almost certainly also set up a relationship map (essentially what Rickard calls a "fish tank"), and it's hard to say which "type of game" is going on.<br/><br/>There's a definitely a difference between "sequential play" and a GM using Bangs, relationship maps, and similar tools, however.<br/><br/>But that can shift at any time during play, from scene to scene. My understanding of Rickard's analysis so far is that he's looking strictly at the texts (what does this book tell you to do in play?), not trying to explain every possible type of game which takes place using that system.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deinol" title="deinol"><img alt="deinol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deinol">deinol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438381/#Comment_438381" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-16T11:15:14+00:00" title="September 16, 2014 11:15AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorcerer is one of those games I still need to pick up. <br/><br/>Even using a strict reading of text can give mixed signals.<br/><br/>Example, in <b>Ryuutama</b> it includes World Creation Rules to create a <i>sandbox</i> of places to travel.

The adventures for the old edition of <b>Deadlands</b> are mostly railroaded when it should be a sandbox. John Wick's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvANYBRWo" rel="nofollow">Dirty Dungeon</a> is sequential play in structure but with collaborative storytelling techniques, much like <b>This Is Pulp</b>.<br/><br/>As when it comes to Deadlands, I applied each basic requirement for each model and the sandbox was the only one that applied. Nothing in the text said that one scene should lead to another, nothing said that any place or event should have any relation to anything else other than what's going on, and nothing said that you should involve the players other than that they could make up why they should give a damn.<br/><br/>I left out some of the harder games to categorize to later. Keep especially an eye out for <b>Oktoberlandet</b>.\n<blockquote>First of all, calling Unknow Armies fishtank is something I disagree with, because so many scenarios have pre-set scenes, often sequential. </blockquote>\nI wonder if the structure of how to convey adventures supports one technique better than the other. If the adventure structures each scene one after another, wont that make the reader more inclined to play it out in that particular sequence? A fish tank should probably come in shape of a relationship map, a sandbox as a map, and why not make the bangs into playable cards?<br/><br/>It's also possible to analyze the adventures to see how well they fit the adventure writing model, and discuss how it does that, or why it doesn't and what could be changed so the adventure fit better. That will be too much work for one person to accomplish so I wont do it. It's also not why I'm doing that thread in the first place.\n<blockquote>Second of all, while I agree with all five definitions currently listed, I think fish tank can be a subset of sandbox.<br/>Or at least there's a lot of adventures that are both fish tank and sandbox.</blockquote>\nI already done an analysis of these models, but the information is gone because www.rollspel.nu lost its old database. What I discovered was that fish tanks and sequential play are very much alike but executed differently. The same probably goes with sandbox and fish tanks, and sequential play and sandboxes. If you got places in a sandbox then it's easy to start experimenting with having relations between different places, and because places are "dead" when it comes to interaction it has to be factions in the places that has these relations.<br/><br/>You could bake fish tank into sandboxes but I think it's necessary to look how they differ, otherwise we could have just one category that says Do Something.<br/><br/>I will update the original thread to make it more clear what the requirements are for each model.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438533/#Comment_438533" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-19T01:30:43+00:00" title="September 19, 2014  1:30AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't forget the fractal factor - it's possible to work in different ways on different levels of the narrative structure at the same time.

I discovered how I myself sometimes used sequential play while playing a fish tank. I think we apply different techniques during the same session without thinking of it, and that's something I think is important to realize. (We know so little of our hobby.)<br/><br/>So we got:<br/>- models (ex. sandbox)<br/>- techniques (ex. sandbox)<br/>- a mixture of models and techniques (ex. running sequential play with collaborative storytelling)<br/>- a mixture of different models (ex. sequential play within a sandbox)<br/>- a shift of different techniques (ex. shifting between bang driven and fish tank)<br/><br/>No wonder it's hard to talk about this. It's bound for misunderstandings. One person talks about the technique ("Deadlands can easily be run as sequential play, fish tank, or sandbox.") and another about the model (me categorizing it as a sandbox based on the text in the book).<br/><br/>So I agree with <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438539/#Comment_438539" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-19T06:51:35+00:00" title="September 19, 2014  6:51AM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it\u2019s especially the <cite>Weep</cite> collection for UA, along with the adventures in the core book, that make them look like sequential play.

And all the time there are good movies that are made that break the "rules" of good movies. <br/><br/>Now mastering the technical details is important to making a good movie. Bad cinematography can be very distracting in a otherwise good movie with good acting. I am sure people can think of lot of other technical mistake that hurt a otherwise good movie.<br/><br/>But in the end it is a matter of luck whether good technique, story, and acting combine into something that sells to an audience. Especially when it comes to great movies. This makes for a situation where generalization about good movies is not really possible or useful. The best you can to list out what could use in making a movie, why you used it, and how it worked out for you.<br/><br/>Then when it comes to a new movies when you chose how to make it, you go in knowing why you are using what you are using. Rather than doing things just because that how things are done.<br/><br/>So what this has to do with roleplaying games? <br/><br/>Because RPGs have a similar problem. Ultimately what they are about is presenting an interesting experience to the players. The game is just a tool to this end. An important tool, but just a tool. Specific tools work well for specific people and not for others. Like movies the situation is such that generalization is not possible or useful.
