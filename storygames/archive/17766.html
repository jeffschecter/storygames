Tonally I think this could be everywhere from Cheech and Chong comedy games to Requiem for a Dream the RPG. You could be simulating the experience of tripping on shrooms or going through cold turkey detox from heroin. Maybe a high speed crystal meth inspired crime game or a resources managing medicinal marijuana grow operation game. Lots of directions to go with this one and interested to see what you do with this.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402083/#Comment_402083" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-29T12:48:51+00:00" title="December 29, 2012 12:48PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            3 players:<br/><br/>1 character-player<br/>1 real-world GM<br/>1 high GM<br/><br/>Whenever the character gets high or comes down from a high, switch GMs.<br/><br/>High GM: while the character's in the real world, dealing with real-world crap, brainstorm magical "if only _" solutions to all their problems, and note these down.  When the character gets high, encourage them to think anything is possible and to do whatever they want.  If they stall, present your brainstormed solutions as opportunities.  If they get right after it, present them as outcomes or side-effects.<br/><br/>Real-world GM: hit the character with boring and stressful everyday crap to make them yearn for the escape of getting high.  When they are high, follow their imagined adventures and do your best to translate these into what might be happening in the real world.  Take notes as needed.  Then brainstorm consequences -- figure out how the stuff the character did while high will bite them once they come down.  The next time the character's sober, introduce these ruthlessly.  Give the character clear opportunities to effectively deal with them, but make the process miserable (for the character, not the player!  fast-forward is your friend).  If you introduce a problem, and the character gets high instead of dealing with it, tack on an irrevocable cost the next time they come down.  Start with a small cost (you've lost your favorite album, the one that's out of print and not on the internet!) then escalate each successive one (lost pet, serious injury, lost car, lost home, etc.).<br/><br/>When the real-world GM is out of escalations other than death, say so.  The character-player may then choose to get high and die, ending the game with one final merry jaunt, or swear off the drugs and live, looking forward to the heap of miserable problem-addressing ahead.  The end!<br/><br/>If the group wants to quit before getting to that point, the character-player can announce at any time that they're giving up the drugs, or that they're getting high till it kills them.<br/><br/>(I don't even know what drug this would be.  I guess a hallucinogen mixed with something mood-boosting.  Ecstacy dissolved in ayahuasca?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChrisL" title="ChrisL"><img alt="ChrisL" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChrisL">ChrisL</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402111/#Comment_402111" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-29T17:01:15+00:00" title="December 29, 2012  5:01PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 29, 2012 5:08PM by ChrisL.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Parlour of Morpheus</b><br/><br/>One player is The Artist. The other player is The Green Fairy. The Artist will need something that fulfils a base, physical pleasure of theirs - ideally absinthe given the name of the other player, but for the (likely many) people who wouldn't enjoy it, some other alcohol, or sweet food, or coffee, or something else you like, will do.<br/><br/>Play follows a simple routine: The Artist takes a drink (or handful of sweets or whatever else you choose) and asks The Green Fairy for inspiration. The Green Fairy describes something which may or may not be beautiful. If The Artist accepts that as beautiful, the game is over and they put away the rest of whatever it was they were drinking or eating. If they reject it, they should describe why it is not beautiful after all - why it is, in fact, hideous, revolting and abominable - and then go back to the first step. Repeat until The Artist finds something beautiful or until the bottle runs dry. Edit: or until The Artist falls asleep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
