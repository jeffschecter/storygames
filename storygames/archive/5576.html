Or a campaign that revolves around military fantasy where the characters are the leaders of a nation/domain/whatnot up against long odds and the game is split between intrigue, statesmanship, strategy and resource management.  I guess that's why Birthright has always intrigued me.  I've never gotten to play those campaigns though.  I think it's probably because I'm always the GM in the games I play.  Hard to GM that stuff for yourself.  It would also explain why I like to play Diplomacy quite a bit.  It scratches some of those itches.<br/><br/>Anyone else out there always wanted to play a specifc style or type of game and not been able to do it?  What was it?  Why didn't it happen?<br/><br/>I'll be frank here.  I've got ulterior motives, though they aren't completely selfish. <br/><br/>1.) I'm just curious to see whether I'm the only loser who can't seem to get it together and manage to play in the game I want.<br/>2.) I might see someone else's "need" as say to myself, "Hey, that sounds neat and I could help out with that."  Then I might actually get to help someone play in that game they always wanted.<br/>3.) Related to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> above, someone might see my "need" and think, "I've always wanted to run that game!" and they might contact me and we might actually get to play.<br/><br/>So!  Tell us what you've always wanted to play and never got to.

Not only did we have to deal with the seven trumpets, we turned out to be involved in a prophecy.  In the penultimate game, my character fell into Hell and died, which prompted the GM to say "okay, now add the half-celestial template to your character."  The last game was going to be the big showdown between men of god (heroes alive and heroes returned) and demons of Strahd.<br/><br/>And that last game never happened.  I always wanted to finish that campaign.

Being willing to work doesn't solve that problem for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124950/#Comment_124950" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-07T10:47:57+00:00" title="February  7, 2008 10:47AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Then you need to break that step down further:<br/><br/>Recruit new gamers until you find one willing to run games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124992/#Comment_124992" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-07T13:03:07+00:00" title="February  7, 2008  1:03PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gaerik</cite>Anyone else out there always wanted to play a specifc style or type of game and not been able to do it?

I.e., my old HERO group was happy to switch between a couple different genres, but only as long as we used HERO. My current D&amp;D group is extremely averse to playing anything but D&amp;D. It's only at Gamedays that I occasionally bump into people who would enjoy being like, e.g., the Durham 3, i.e., cycling through various RPGs, constantly trying new things.<br/><br/>Granted, I have yet to make a concerted effort to pull together such a group.

Pick a really basic ruleset, tie it to a kind of setting, and keep a design opening of some kind (by design opening I mean something that you can always make more of, like... Items, monster powers, and feats).  That way we could have fun with both design and setting / story writing.  Then do the 100/20 ratio as a matter of challenges.  Like, if we were using RBH as a base:<br/><br/>[100 words of my response to the last challenge]<br/><br/>"I challenge you to make a new monster special power!" or "I challenge you to add a port to the map!" or "I challenge you to make a villain encounter fun!" and anybody can take up the previous unanswered challenge.  <br/><br/>So all you would need to do if you wanted to play is read the first post and the most recent.  We'd end up with this grab-bag of campaign content.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125191/#Comment_125191" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-08T11:42:45+00:00" title="February  8, 2008 11:42AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to play in a game run by my brilliant, but rules-phobic wife.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I care about what the setting is.

I think the closest I've discovered so far is Lejendary Adventure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_125428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams" title="MKAdams"><img alt="MKAdams" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams">MKAdams</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125428/#Comment_125428" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-09T13:46:11+00:00" title="February  9, 2008  1:46PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a few campaigns I've always wanted to run, but have never found the right players for:<br/><br/>A)  A campaign set in a low-magic, fairly realistic medieval Britain (circa 1250) about siblings (I imagine brothers, but a sister could fit in there) from a small village who go from being callow youths to the greatest heroes of the land, possibly becoming kings.  The campaign would be heavily influenced by the real folklore of region, where every ogre has a name and is a local legend, and unrestful spirits with names like Ginny Greenteeth haunt local ponds.  It would start small, with the village and immediate environs being the whole of the world at first, and gradually growing as the player's grew too big for their pond.  I'd always imagined using D&amp;D for this game, but I think it's never happened precisely because I wanted to use D&amp;D.  Now I think I'd more likely use Burning Wheel.<br/><br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> A campaign set in a mythical Africa about a group of young Maasi warriors chosen by the prophecy of the local witchdoctor to embark on a great quest to restore the health of their war chief, who has fallen ill.  The campaign would be all about journey and discovery, as the boys are forced to leave the simple but harsh life of raising cattle on the savannah and travel north into the strange kingdoms of Ethopia and Egypt.  Very low magic, and what magic there is would be rooted in the African animist traditions that inform Voodoo and Houdon.  And again, very strongly rooted in the real folklore of Africa.  Unfortunately I tend to encounter to much unacknowledged racism in the gaming groups I've played with to try to seriously run this campaign.  Not sure what system I'd use, maybe Burning Wheel or my own system (since I'd practically have to rewrite Burning Wheel anyways).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams" title="MKAdams"><img alt="MKAdams" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MKAdams">MKAdams</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125429/#Comment_125429" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-09T13:53:19+00:00" title="February  9, 2008  1:53PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also dig the idea that DannyK and merb101 were discussing.

It's something that in all probability will get consigned to the 'always wanted to play' folder before too long.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
