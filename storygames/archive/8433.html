Maybe you want to paint, too!<br/><br/>I'm planning on doing some Warhammer Catachan Jungle Fighters from 40k and some Chaos stuff from their fantasy line, even though I don't play any Warhammer (yet). I also have genuine, non-ironic ambitions to paint some Dogs in the Vineyard miniatures this year. I may just repaint some D&amp;D Minis in ways that are interesting to me. It'll be fun!

They do sell other companies' minis as well, some of which are decidedly nicer ( and also have the 40% club discount).<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/>Oh yeah, be aware that the Blue Moon minis are giants, coming in at around 30mm foot to eyes. that puts them more in line with Black Scorpion cowboys and significantly more massive than most minis, even Heroic 25mm ( aka bulky 28mm figures).<br/><br/>Not that it ever stops me from mixing and matching.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
