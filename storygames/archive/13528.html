This is great fun, and constantly provides me with fresh insight on gaming.<br/><br/>Some time ago, the PCs arrived to a town for the first time. Being low on supplies, they decided to go shopping. Since they started out with pregens, they never got to choose their own equipment out of a list - only to pick their share of the loot. As you might imagine, their first time going over the equipment lists was a time of great excitement. They got to pick cool swag to customize their characters like they wanted to, and make plans for what to purchase when they find the next treasure.<br/><br/>When I watched them going on a shopping spree, it struck me that they were acting like modern consumers in a shopping mall: buying stuff in order to define yourself is what Consumer Culture is all about (this is not a value judgment; I don't consider it necessarily a bad thing).<br/>I also realized that in the games I participated in, I have never done a proper shopping scene.<br/><br/>I wasn't going to ruin the kids' fun by starting a discussion about different approaches to shopping and its representation, but I am going to try and ruin yours. So, how do you handle shopping in historical or fantasy settings? Is it any different than your modern, real-life shopping experience?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305657/#Comment_305657" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T02:26:44+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  2:26AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IMO shopping is boring.

Buying plate mail wouldn't just be about combat. You'd be saying: look, I am wearing fucking <i>plate mail</i> because I am a <i>fucking good fighter</i>. (Again, this is the era when people would display suits of armour in their houses.)<br/><br/>The last time we played AD&amp;D, I played a beggar who was uncomfortable with having money.

Like, if the people were suspicious or jovial or stingy or generous or what.<br/><br/>This was a long time ago. In highschool, we didn't know that the past wasn't really like the present... you know? And so yeah, it was pretty much choose-what-you-want-off-the-shelf, and if the shop didn't have something that you wanted, it felt like the DM was screwing me around. <br/><br/>A little after that, we got into one-on-one "survival fiction" games of AD&amp;D, wherein the solo protagonist had to creatively make due with very few items (I remember killing goblins with my bare hands... "Nope, they're not armed, either." Fuck! nothing to steal!), while having a sort-of protagonist immunity or something, that my character would undergo hella hardship, but never die. And that was fun. <br/><br/>And in my first games, i just picked up everything. I had an inventory that was pages long. I had a gigantic backpack and we didn't do encumbrance; besides, it was mostly little stuff like books of elven poetry and rag dolls and stubs of candles and so on. Rocks. Sticks. Kind of weird, in retrospect. Not really shopping, but defining my character as their ability to collect fictional objects.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305744/#Comment_305744" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T11:48:16+00:00" title="December 23, 2010 11:48AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like equipment, but hate shopping.<br/><br/>By which I mean that it's still pretty fun to have a long list of cool equipment, to think about what my character would want, to save up the resources to get it, to describe what it looks like...all that stuff.

The GM said something like "you enter the town's tradehouse. Here's what you can buy. It's a poor town, so they don't have anything that costs over 20gp". He then put the equipment lists on the table and read it aloud for the smaller children. They chose stuff based on how cool it sounded, or how cool the illustration was, and were less interested in stuff related to game mechanics.<br/><br/>So the shopping scene did not involve characters going from shop to shop for stuff, but rather the players going excitedly over the lists, discussing what's cool and what's not.<br/><br/>Johnzo: I'm basically using OD&amp;D with a 4th edition shell. Some kids have the 4th edition player handbook with its endless lists of powers, but these certainly don't make an easy read for young children - the Hebrew version is written in nearly-incomprehensible translatorese, and - like most books not aimed directly at children - without diacritics. What's worse, the Hebrew names for the powers are absolutely uninspiring. So in that respect, the shopping lists are blocked or plain uninteresting for most children. When levelling up, I usually present them with 2-3 choices - something along the line of choosing between a healing power or a fighting move. They are definitely excited about getting new powers, but there is no shopping quality involved.<br/><br/>Graham: Defining yourself by stuff you own is different from defining yourself based on stuff you buy. You don't go to the market district and look for a plate mail by master smith Gerhard to prove what a badass you are; instead, you go to master smith Gerhard and ask him to make you a huge plate mail with skull-shaped spikes, because that's how badass you are. You don't buy your castle - you get people to design and build it for you. What happened with the shopping scene was different: it was "ooh, a bastard sword, I want one of those", and not "I want an extra-long sword, on a pole, because that would fit the fighting style I want to develop".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305892/#Comment_305892" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-24T17:14:18+00:00" title="December 24, 2010  5:14PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: elkin</cite>They chose stuff based on how cool it sounded, or how cool the illustration was, and were less interested in stuff related to game mechanics.<br/><br/>So the shopping scene did not involve characters going from shop to shop for stuff, but rather the players going excitedly over the lists, discussing what's cool and what's not.</blockquote>\nThis is why shopping in RPGs is good and not bad, forever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
