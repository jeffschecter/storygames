Howard).  Most of the characters have keys related to their quest (reaching the fabled West) or their party.  I've not run many games where the group was traveling a great distance for the majority of the campaign and am struggling with techniques to prep.<br/><br/>An R-Map is basically worthless for such a scenario where the group will not stay put unless the relationships are also traveling.  The R-Map and development of antagonism through complicated and de-evolving relationships is my sort of shtick and now I have nothing to lean on.  Obviously I can just hit them with new situations and bangs which attempt to break up the party and tear apart the mission but I'm looking for perhaps some more sophisticated techniques or advice.  Examples would be great too.

Tie these all to the the big hairy goal (the west) and then link them with one of the following links:<br/>\nAn obstacle that must be overcome<br/>\nHelp that can be won, but there is a problem to be overcome<br/>\nHelp that is freely given but at a price<br/>\nthen tie them to each other, or write up other elements. Find three links that fit the kind of narrative you are trying to build (in r-map it is blood, sex and money, here it could be food/water, magic, apocalypse).<br/>\nFor your own sake tie a few standard assosiated obstacles to the elements as resources the element can "use" to further its agenda against the BHG.<br/>\nThen play these things like you would play an npc in an r-map.<br/>\nTie them up to the playercharacters' keys and hit them for what it is worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nby the way, this is just an idea, so it needs some more thinking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/5niper9" title="5niper9"><img alt="5niper9" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/5niper9">5niper9</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190426/#Comment_190426" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-28T12:21:15+00:00" title="January 28, 2009 12:21PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if the r-map technique is really that worthless.

The problem though is how do you achieve that non-random element when the major group flags are really pointed at progressing with the Quest of making it to the West?  If you're providing obstacles to a group of travelers isn't it really random?  Perhaps the problem is I need more internal adversity, maybe a couple of the NPCs they are journeying with could serve as antagonists.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190451/#Comment_190451" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-28T14:26:12+00:00" title="January 28, 2009  2:26PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so a while ago, I ran an Unknown Armies game that was an odyssey. The characters started in Philadelphia and were headed cross-country to Seattle. In their possession, an infant child with unexplained power. In pursuit...well, everyone. At least, so it seemed to the two PCs, neither of whom were initiates in the Occult Underground. But there were people in Seattle who would be able to keep the child safe.<br/><br/>Each adventure then ended up having something of a pattern:<br/><br/>1) Recap what had happened last session.<br/><br/>2) Play out the characters in the car/van/whatever vehicle they had currently liberated. This was essentially a period of reflection on what had come before, but in-character. This is where we'd reveal the changes that the characters had undergone because of the last session.<br/><br/>3) Thing intervenes. And...go! Usually, "go" meant "survive what's coming at you while protecting the infant", though sometimes it meant "figure out how to feed yourselves and buy diapers for the child with $20. Oh yeah, plus buy gas to keep moving". Given that the child was essentially a beacon of magical power, this was easy to explain and embrace.<br/><br/>4) Lather, rinse, repeat.<br/><br/>Of course, the greatest moment of the campaign was when the PCs decided to abandon the quest to protect the child....<br/><br/>The campaign was technically episodic with recurring villains. However, the *real* story of the game was about the evolving relationships between the PCs and their ongoing acts of sacrifice to protect this child.<br/><br/>Hopefully this helps.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson" title="d.anderson"><img alt="d.anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson">d.anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190498/#Comment_190498" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T00:02:15+00:00" title="January 29, 2009 12:02AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you have people they've left behind?  Memories that haunt them?  Secrets that will have to come out?  A lot of people along the way will want things from them, hindering their progress - find out what will make them have to make hard choices or sacrifices.  Or disagree with one another, whether about methods or principles.  And maybe the West doesn't want folks from Mutationville stinking up the place, and catches wind of their efforts, and acts to counter.  But then they're divided about these heroes or whatever.  Human relationships are all around on the road and what you walk away from doesn't always leave you alone.  Where you're going may not be all it's cracked up to be.  Progress may rely on getting involved in other people's problems.

However, one of the Characters is a Crusader/Holy Warrior type and when another player suggested he be opposed to his religion the Crusader requested that we focus on a campaign with minimal inter-PC conflict - or at least where core issues of the characters are not challenged by another character.<br/><br/>I think I have a handle on the situation now.  I ended up working with the players so that instead of going on one direct path they now require additional details before they can find their way to the mythic land.  Thus, traveling will not be in a straight line but crossing location to location in order to find the necessary information to actually locate their goal.  I ended up combining Kaare's challenge map with the adventure map from Solar System to produce something quite usable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg" title="Kaare Berg"><img alt="Kaare Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kaare%20Berg">Kaare Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190596/#Comment_190596" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T19:14:14+00:00" title="January 29, 2009  7:14PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, I'd love to see what you came up with.<br/>\n<br/>\nLets see it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190600/#Comment_190600" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T20:22:02+00:00" title="January 29, 2009  8:22PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Travel can be a metaphor for self-transformation, each challenge reflecting character development, a lesson or realization that must be learned or accepted. For this approach to succeed, characters must begin somewhere. Let me present the approach I took in a homebrew game called <i>Bandele (Born Away From Home)</i>.<br><br>What a character finds nostalgic about the place from which he or she came is their "root."<br/><br/>What drove a character to leave his or her home is called "wind."<br/><br/>What hope the character hopes to find through travel is his or her "wings."<br/><br/>While all of these things are set at character creation, they were all malleable during play. They did all have mechanical definitions and effects. The struggle to change them was also handled mechanically, too. The precise system for doing so would not likely fit your game, but I found it was important that they did have mechanics, because then challenges could be set up against them.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190601/#Comment_190601" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T20:36:43+00:00" title="January 29, 2009  8:36PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few random challenge ideas:<br/>- getting low on resources with no civilization in sight (play out the survival, don't just allow a roll)<br/>- a town mistrusting of strangers<br/>- border guards demanding "authorization to travel" papers, and the demands of whatever patrons might aid in obtaining those papers<br/>- hard bargains with travelling merchants<br/>- bandits (who should always offer as part of their initial threat to leave the characters with enough to get to the next town, and who love to steal money, but not as much in the way of bulky goods)<br/>- odd items used as currency on the road (tea bricks were common in China) making currency exchanges difficult<br/>- offers to work as smugglers<br/>- wolves or other beastly dangers<br/>- trade opportunities (some of which may turn out to be pitfalls, as well as taxation problems and guilds that try to enforce monopolies)<br/>- territorial spirits and gods (especially if your setting is multi-pantheonistic)<br/>- a washed-out bridge (do you look for another way or try to fix this path?)<br/><br/>I really suggest seeking out and watching the television series <i>Wolf and Spice</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190614/#Comment_190614" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T22:49:40+00:00" title="January 29, 2009 10:49PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like Kaare's idea, which I basically read as 'make a relationship map that is not constrained to people' -- kind of like a one-step-abstracted relationship map, where the thing on the map could <i>manifest</i> as a person in any given encounter, but could also manifest as an event or as a thematic challenge. Or where it could manifest as another person who has no actual relationship to the first other than that they both are manifestations of the larger concept.<br/><br/>The key to making it a relationship map is to a) map out interdependancy between those one-step-abstracted concepts, and b) have them react organically, in the same way a single person might react, and spin those reactions into all later manifestations.<br/><br/>So you know, ultra-simple example, a love triangle relationship between Wind, Starvation, and Children. Both Starvation and the Wind are competing for the love of Children, who begins the game equally enamored of them both. Also, Wind is Starvation's father, and so feels responsible for Starvation, which complicates the relationship. <br/><br/>So Wind could manifest as a dust storm, or maybe someone yearning for travel or distant news; it could seek the love of Children by killing them, or by making them into messengers, or by telling them secrets or leading them to secret places. Starvation could manifest straightforwardly or in more complex political situations involving the distribution of food; the ultimate consummation with Children would presumably involve children starving to death, but it could also involve children gaining power by starving others, some kind of spiritual emaciation, etc. Children are the easiest to manifest -- any child that appears in the story is a manifestation of Children that resonates back to the R-map.<br/><br/>Anyways, the point being that if the PCs encounter a starving town, where the adults are at death's door because they give what little food they have to their children -- you can see how solutions or reactions to this problem could resonate back and affect the overall relationship.<br/><br/>So let's say the next encounter is all about a wandering child who has visions in the wilderness -- if the PC's reaction to the first encounter involved a child starving to death, then perhaps this wandering child is now starving, and no longer having visions. But if the PC's reaction to the first encounter was to save the children but not the adults, the wandering child is healthy and friendly.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Anyways it is a clumsy example, particularly because the PCs are not central to my relationship map -- but if you imagine that one PC is a child, and another is a farmer or the priest of a fertility god, you can see how it starts to look more and more like your usual R-map.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190618/#Comment_190618" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-30T00:07:26+00:00" title="January 30, 2009 12:07AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>More concretely, you <em>can</em> make an r-map for the game, you just need to talk in terms of larger entities.</p>\n<p>In other words, you can make a <em>map.</em> But not just a geographical map.

We pretty much finished up our first Challenge Map so I'll be creating a new one - I'll probably be prepping them in chunks so that when I run out of stuff on the current map I'll start a new Challenge Map (As Euro suggests doing with Adventure Maps in Solar System).  Don't want to make the map too far-reaching into the future as I don't want to be tied down that far ahead or plan out too much of the campaign.  I'll definitely post when my next map is completed.<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way, keep the suggestions coming if you feel so generous as I'll be grabbing everything I can from this thread for future play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190690/#Comment_190690" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-30T14:26:45+00:00" title="January 30, 2009  2:26PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Road stories always have colorful characters and encounters along the way that come, then fade, but leave some impact on the characters' lives.
