We took turns scene framing - I think we did "on your turn, frame a scene about one or more of the other players characters" - though "frame a scene about your character" would probably have worked just as well. <br/><br/>Here's the doc we kept if you're interested:  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VTJ76IVIhsrnAPwOV9uzR4f8oAJ0uDQ2KQ8p5AlKh14/edit?hl=en_US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VTJ76IVIhsrnAPwOV9uzR4f8oAJ0uDQ2KQ8p5AlKh14/edit?hl=en_US</a><br/><br/>NPC's were a bit weird - anybody could bring one in and stat them up on the fly - and we were 'advocating' for our characters, so a smart way to engage in conflict with other PC's would have been to create NPC's to do our conflicting for us and let them take the damage. But we didn't game it that hard.<br/><br/>It was a bit klunky for us. "Who should frame now?" "What should I frame about?" "Should I create an npc?" These judgment calls broke flow.<br/><br/>My feeling now is even in a 3-player game I'd rather play 1 GM + 2 PC's than GM-less.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344412/#Comment_344412" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-29T11:28:43+00:00" title="September 29, 2011 11:28AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ivan, what do you aim for, in doing this instead of following the rules as written?

When we tried it, we realized immediately that there was too much stuff that was not regulated, especially if we wanted to play it with some gumption.<br/><br/>JDFristrom rightly points out a good number of the issues that didn't work..  who frames scenes for whom? can NPCs be introduced at any time? the lack of dice refresh rules for IAWA means that after a few scenes everyone is down to small dice.. but you can just introduce a new NPC with full dice.<br/><br/>What about narrative authority? We thought about Polaris-like mechanics but it's not clear how to mix that with IAWA rules.<br/><br/>So.. to answer to Rafu: IAWA hints to the wonders of GMless play with its co-creation mechanisms.. but when you try to do it, it falls flat. I would love to keep that co-creation spirit going during the game, while also allowing for full-blown IAWA aggressiveness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344434/#Comment_344434" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-29T14:39:45+00:00" title="September 29, 2011  2:39PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, you're looking for "GM-less" play as its own end? IMHO, IaWA is, as written, already as co-creative as any "GM-less" game: don't let yourself be distracted by the fact that one of the players is called "GM". Sure, there are differentiated duties and tasks between players, but I'd suggest you try to see how it's not even that different from Polaris in that regard, except that while in Polaris roles rotate around the table on a per-scene basis, in IaWA they do on a per-session basis. Sure, the current GM frames all of the scenes (for a session), but is that otherwise that much different from being everybody's Mistaken for a whole session's length?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344438/#Comment_344438" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-29T15:06:19+00:00" title="September 29, 2011  3:06PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 29, 2011 3:06PM by ivan.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rafu, I see your point, but we are a very very small group that meets up pretty rarely (when we meet back in our hometown in the alps)  and I would rather have everyone playing on the spot without any of us feeling anxious about having to run a game.<br/><br/>I know, IAWA is no prep but still..<br/><br/>Of course we could play something different, but since I like the game I am curious to see if it can be tweaked into gmless mode.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344472/#Comment_344472" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-29T18:40:54+00:00" title="September 29, 2011  6:40PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I usually play IaWA without a GM, and it works fine.

You lose a few dice or you just give in and go looking for a different conflict to try and win, and after a few hours you might have only one stat you can win with.<br/><br/>For scene framing, somebody suggests a scene they'd like to play and I think one of three things happens: everybody says okay do it, or we make a few suggestions and negotiate, or somebody has an idea for a scene that should happen before that one. If somebody wasn't in a particular scene, it's sort-of "their turn" to have a scene. Mostly whoever is in the scene gets final word on what it is. NPCs get introduced as we need them, which is occasionally, but certainly not for every scene.<br/><br/>Essentially, our characters are antagonistic to each other and probably have shifting alliances throughout the game, but as players we work together to make something that entertains everybody. Occasionally somebody will feel ganged-up on, like if we have 3 players, and there's a lot of 2-on-1 or one player fails a bunch of conflicts and feels like their ideas get shut down, so we do have to watch out for that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344606/#Comment_344606" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-01T01:23:02+00:00" title="October  1, 2011  1:23AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Johnstone, so were Scenes set up and run collectively?

In my experience, most conflicts end without somebody choosing to damage the other person's stats -- the negotiation rules are used frequently, in an attempt to extract fictional concessions, with stat damage being a secondary option. It still happens, of course, and over time PCs will definitely get worn down, but at least in my play (note: my play and Johnstone's play overlaps a fair bit, since we game together) this has never felt like an issue. It usually takes more than 'a couple' of conflicts before PCs start to feel the hurt, in any case.<br/><br/>Similarly, there are usually very few NPCs introduced after the initial situation among the PCs has been established -- generally, the web of Best Interests creates such a tightly-woven situation that only one or two additional NPCs seem necessary, and I can't really remember ever introducing a brand new, statted-up NPC very late in the session, because usually the focus becomes narrower as play proceeds and the central intra-PC conflict comes to a head. It would have never occured to me to bring in an NPC specifically to hose over other PCs, for example, or to indirectly take advantage of their lowered stats.<br/><br/>In terms of controlling NPCs, I seem to remember that usually one player has primary control, at least at first, though this may then switch around if the NPC seems to be coming into conflict with or interacting with that player's PC -- nobody likes to roleplay both sides of a conversation. Generally the NPCs' motives (or more accurately, their role within the story/situation) are pretty transparent, and might be discussed a little bit at the table when the NPC is first introduced -- I think if there was a situation where the NPC's actions are both a) uncertain and b) decisive to a conflict between PCs, I would probably start a conflict specifically regarding the question of how the NPC acts (as each PC tries to get her on their side, for example.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344612/#Comment_344612" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-01T04:10:49+00:00" title="October  1, 2011  4:10AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2011 4:11AM by Johnstone.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first time I played IaWA, and the only time I GMed it, I literally had nothing to do for the second half of the game except look up rules for the players. I had some NPCs I introduced in the first half, but once I helped get all the PCs into the same situation, the three other players consistently ignored my NPCs and concentrated on conflicts between themselves. That's been the general inclination in all the GMless games I've played, too.<br/><br/>Players introduced NPCs when needed, often for "cosmetic" purposes, like to fill out a scene, and occasionally as an antagonist for somebody else's PC, although there's not much incentive to do so, when you've got a perfectly good PC that you've invested in that you could play instead. Although occasionally the fiction has denied a PC from being in a scene, and that player has played an NPC. Very rare, though. So, more of a play style thing than any concrete rules.<br/><br/>If the player declares an action against a PC... hmm. I can't remember many cases of this. Usually a player describes what his PC does until it buts up against another PC. In fact, I'm not sure if there were actually any PC-NPC conflicts. NPCs might only have been involved in three-ways. If all the players agreed it was interesting, we probably allowed a conflict with an NPC. If anybody thought it was boring, we probably let the player narrate whatever.<br/><br/>And what Daniel said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344613/#Comment_344613" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-01T04:13:58+00:00" title="October  1, 2011  4:13AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite>Johnstone, so were Scenes set up and run collectively?

We have the oracles, we discuss ideas, pick characters, create a bunch of stuff for the situation, then usually whoever has the strongest idea for a scene frames it. Other players introduce their PCs as they see fit. When we think a scene's over, usually at the end of a conflict, it's somebody else's "turn" or again whoever has the strongest idea for a scene suggests it, gets approval from the group, then frames it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344766/#Comment_344766" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-03T17:26:53+00:00" title="October  3, 2011  5:26PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2011 5:28PM by ivan.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I can distill a few points from this thread..<br/><br/>When trying to make IAWA collaborative, I tried to make it GMfull.. with rotating GMs, whereas the other people in this thread made it Peerful, with many people collaborating and socially negotiating to make up rules.<br/><br/>The lack of rules to handle it made me panic, whereas Johnstone and Daniel (Emperor) just negotiated up to a compromise.. they kind of played it as jazz, and it worked for them. I still feel I should have some rules to fall back on and give me negotiation power, but this is probably my insecurity going fully freeform.<br/><br/>We decided to play aggressively, as from the spirit of IAWA. Johnstone and Daniel, also played aggressively from the point of view of the characters, but they played collaboratively as peers/players building a story. Again, I find it difficult to do it without a safety net of negotiation rules. <br/><br/>Is it correct to say that you guys played IAWA fully freeform, aiming to converge on conflicts where two mutually exclusive, undecidable events could happen.. and only then you went for the dice?<br/><br/>I find it difficult to balance the Go for the Throat + No You Fucking Don't approach on the character level with the collaboration on the player level. I keep feeling that I need a Polaris-style management of scenes and narrative, or maybe a universalis-style management of narrative currency.. <br/><br/>Yet maybe these are just crutches until you get the level of flow to go fully freeform.. but I guess you also need a crew that is very well tuned and you just get the vibe of what is right and wrong to do while you play together.<br/><br/>--i.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344803/#Comment_344803" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-04T01:55:37+00:00" title="October  4, 2011  1:55AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that sounds about right. A couple things you could try:<br/><br/>1. Take turns framing scenes. And remember, the start of a scene is no big deal, really. You can still have characters move around and stuff.<br/><br/>2. If you're used to being the GM and asking "what do you do now?" you need to ditch that. Frame a scene as a GM, then start paying your character in it. Have your character just come in and get what he wants unless the other PCs stop him. And make sure what he wants is what they don't want.<br/><br/>3. Going for the throat is perfectly fine when you're in that conflict, because you're rolling dice and making demands. Outside of a conflict, you can take your time, throw in suggestions. One thing to note is we tend to play with people who suggest ideas at any and all points during the game, even when they're not involved as either a player or a character. Players in most rpgs tend to have a sense of ownership over their character, and you can extend that to the character's sphere of influence, so you're portraying more than just your character as a physical body walking around. You are portraying the full character, with background, culture, ideas, and themes as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345080/#Comment_345080" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-06T15:19:09+00:00" title="October  6, 2011  3:19PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guys, what would you do if you cannot easily reach a negotiation on the meta-level, between the players? would you make up a rule on the spot?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345090">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345090/#Comment_345090" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-06T17:18:16+00:00" title="October  6, 2011  5:18PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You mean, an after-conflict negotiation (in which case, insist for defaults!)?

What I don't understand is the sense I get that you think we are discarding some enormous edifice of rules; we are after all still using the core conflict-resolution mechanic, as well as the core situation-generation mechanics (oracles, best interests.) That's like 95% of the game, from my point of view. <br/><br/>The only things we're changing in our play is the rules surrounding who frames scenes, and who controls NPCs. The way you describe us using the conflict rules, for example, is how the conflict rules work in the version of the game with a GM. You go to a conflict when one person says 'my character does THIS' and somebody else says 'no, you don't.' There's no special GM version of this, that I am aware. That's always (and only) how conflicts start: with character action opposed by other character action.<br/><br/>From your description I get this feeling you think we are having to constantly negotiate a large number of rules; from my point of view, we are using the vast majority of the game's rules as-written, and changing a very small number of rules which, importantly, only really affect before- and between-scene play. In A Wicked Age is such a character-driven game that, in my experience, things like scene framing and NPC ownership are relatively minor in terms of overall play.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite>Guys, what would you do if you cannot easily reach a negotiation on the meta-level, between the players? would you make up a rule on the spot?</blockquote>\nJohnstone has kind of already described what rules we have in play. For example, the rule for scene framing is: once a scene is done, the next scene is framed by a) someone other than whoever just framed a scene, b) whoever is the most excited about their idea, and c) if several people are excited about ideas then preference goes to whoever has framed a scene less recently, or both ideas are put forward and the group reaches a consensus.<br/><br/>Given the catch-all nature of the last rule, there's really no case that falls under your example. I am guessing that if we had two players who were absolutely adamant that their scene had to come next, and no consensus could be reached among the other players, and the scenes they were proposing were mutually exclusive in the fiction -- then we would probably just have them roll a die to see who gets to go next. So yes, we'd make up a rule, but the rule would be completely arbitrary, because we'd only ever get to that point after we'd somehow exhausted all social negotiation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345131/#Comment_345131" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-07T01:42:33+00:00" title="October  7, 2011  1:42AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite>Rafu, what do you mean by 'defaults' ?</blockquote>\nInjured or Exhausted.

Normal IAWA rules take care of character conflicts and you use your spotlight rule to decide who does scene framing.

I feel like we've usually just set up about as much as we need to say who the characters are and set up the first conflict. It's definitely not as much prep as we've done setting up for shock: or more normal GMed games we intend to play longer-term.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite>What I wonder about is the larger setting.. who can say facts about the world at large?

Anybody can say anything except something about another PC, and even then, you can still make a suggestion (all contributions are really suggestions, anyway). And I mean, if somebody is really opposed to something, I wouldn't want to include it anyway. And if somebody really wants something that doesn't break the game for me, I don't see any reason to object. If somebody's iffy on something, the suggester gets a chance to justify/explain it. We just never had any fights over it, and we didn't see the need to add scene management rules. I don't see any reason why you couldn't add those in if you like them, I just don't have any advice for how to go about it. You're on your own, scouting out new territory!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: framweard</cite>What's the difference between GMless and peerfully? Are they different words for the same thing, or am I missing something?</blockquote>\nI think peerful is where all the participants have the same role, and GMless is just where there's no GM? Like, shock: and Polaris aren't peerful because there's different roles, but there's still no GM.

We never used the same characters and setting for more than one session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345489/#Comment_345489" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-10T18:38:24+00:00" title="October 10, 2011  6:38PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vincent has always said that it's important to have characters in the stories who CANNOT go on the We Owe list.
