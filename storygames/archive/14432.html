So he made it so that most of his games, especially his campaigns ended that way. The problem is, unless it is followed by Return of the Jedi, as an RPG experience, especially after it has happened to you the 10th time, you start to get frustrated.<br/><br/>Negative moments can suck but they often make the positive moments that come after that much more amazing. To be a strong hero, sometimes you need a stronger villain. To have the hero get revenge, first something terrible has to happen to make revenge justified / relatable / exciting. <br/><br/>But this requires trust!<br/><br/>There needs to be a payoff. I have to trust that the negative has a point\u2026 that it leads somewhere. If you're playing with strangers, that trust usually isn't there. So what do you do?<br/><br/>When I GM for strangers, if I'm roleplaying a sexist or racist NPC\u2026 I will make it clear than I, John, think this character is sexist or racist. I'll roleplay the character saying something terrible\u2026 and will react to it as a person out of character. I'll clue people in that I'm self-aware of how terrible the character is. That self-awareness builds trust and separation from real people and the fiction which helps deal with uncomfortable material. It helps give people a reason to keep engaged, knowing this is going somewhere and not random. <br/><br/>And one of the most important lessons I've learned as a GM\u2026 the reveal, doesn't come at the climax. The reveal comes when the players need it. If the players are starting to become uncomfortable with some negative element in the fiction, it might be time to show my cards before I lose them\u2026 before I squander the trust I've built up.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328184/#Comment_328184" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T08:45:26+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  8:45AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>the reveal, doesn't come at the climax.

I've been in games that kinda fell apart because the GM basically planned the Reveal for further out than the players were willing to handle. It basically led to fizzling: People making other more important plans, prioritizing different, etc. Like how you might have a tiny bit of a stomachache but still be psyched for gaming so you slam some TUMS/Pepto and go anyway? In a game that fizzles you'd just call in sick and play video games (or plan for another more fun gaming session) instead.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328209/#Comment_328209" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T10:35:12+00:00" title="June  7, 2011 10:35AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I understand what you're saying about "the reveal".

And when they entered the table, they were okay with me talking about niggers who the PCs were free to exploit in their efforts.<br/><br/>As a player - or a reader, watcher etc. - I need to trust the storyteller. I've only watched the new Battlestar Galactica series once and I felt I didn't get as much out of it as I could; for some reason or another, I wasn't confident that the creators could find a way to satisfactorily explain the speculative/supernatural stuff, and that's why I enjoyed the hell out of all the political stuff and felt awkward with most of the speculative elements. Now that I know how it ends, I might enjoy it better. I think one of the reasons for the lack of trust was that at first BSG seemed to be everything I wanted from a new SF show: no aliens, no supernatural stuff, generally a grittier attitude (gritty hadn't become ubiquitous yet) - then it brought in elements that I felt conflicted with the gritty, no-bullshit-realism of the show. And I hated the credit sequences which showed what's up in the episode, and hated Tricia Helfer with a raging fire in my heart.<br/><br/>In more general terms: in my point of view, the storyteller (i.e. the makers of the show) had already made poor decisions and I couldn't trust that the main plot wasn't one of them. At the gaming table I could speak with the group about how I feel, but with BSG I couldn't go on to the internet because I feared spoilers <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>For similar reasons, I'd need to really trust the GM if he decided to radically change some central elements in the game world after a few sessions. ("This is sword &amp; sorcery, Howardian style. Make Howardian characters. Let's play good pulp fantasy until in session 8, THE ELVES ARRIVE.") And while we're waiting for the payoff, the GM should take care that despite those radical changes, there's still lots of that good old stuff left. ("After speaking with Elrond, you enter the slums, shadowed by the Great Tower, and meet up with the Pallid Druid, who suddenly but inevitably summons GIANT SNAKES!")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/graypawn" title="graypawn"><img alt="graypawn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3334/3586780205_8c6584252f_o.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/graypawn">graypawn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328239/#Comment_328239" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T12:53:02+00:00" title="June  7, 2011 12:53PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of the difference between trust and payoff and all of this stems from what the people involved want.  I've known players that would love a long-lasting campaign that ended every time with the protagonists screwed and teary-eyed.  I've known GMs that couldn't deal the final blow to a character if it meant the salvation of the story or group, it just wasn't in them to kill the goodguys.  And i've known gamers of all kinds that don't care what the outcome was, as long as it felt 'real'.  This is the mire of trying to segregate Gamist/Narrativist/Simulationist.  We shift between them, and in so doing we skew what we think we want.<br/><br/>As much as i hate to believe it, the happy-vs-sad ending is not a universal (my opinion).  Different groups are going to want different pressures and threats from their GM/MC/DM.  I think you're dead on that revealing the motivations for the stuff stacked against your players is a tough balance to find, and an important one.  I think another thing is to find out if your players want something scary for their character to fight against, or if they want something that actually <i>scares them</i> to fight against.  Do they want tension to build from the outcome of a roll, or the flavor of the villainy?<br/><br/>I can see people sticking with an Empire ending because they adored the GMs unnerving adherence to hard reality (Vader IS your Dad, and he IS way better at cutting off hands than you are, sorry it happened at the end of this session...come back next time anyway.)  And i can see players going through hacked limbs, dreadful secrets, and PCs frozen in carbonite because they trust the GM will throw up his hands at some point in the future and say, "So that's how you win...with an army of teddy bears...and love."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328267/#Comment_328267" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T14:25:26+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  2:25PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: boulet</cite>I'm not sure I understand what you're saying about "the reveal".

How much building depends on the player's level of excitement or boredom. <br/><br/>We have ups so we can have downs, so we have more ups. Contrast creates drama. But the question of how long to stay up or down depends on the players. <br/><br/>The question of\u2026 do you end on and up or a down, also depends on the players, their expectations, and how open they are to expectations being broken. <br/><br/>If I'm going to play a bad guy that annoys the players, it's so that they feel awesome when they kick that bad guy's ass. I'm not doing it to upset the players. It's an implicit promise that an ass kicking (or at least a chance at an ass kicking) is in the future. But if I block that ass kicking, I'm breaking my promise. When that ass kicking comes also depends on when the players have had enough. There is a fine line between, "now we are primed to kick ass" and "we don't care anymore." That same goes for positive experiences. When the players win a battle and earn treasure, the amount of treasure they earn depends on the players. I try to make it enough that they feel rewarded but want more while avoiding giving them so much that it cheapens future rewards. <br/><br/>The more intense the negative, theoretically the more intense the positive will be. But everyone has different lines and even though we all know this is a game, the emotions can be real. So it helps to create distance. If I'm going to play a bad person, especially if I'm playing with strangers, it helps to make sure people know that I myself am not a bad person, I'm just playing one and I also think the character I'm playing is a jerk. But I'm not a mind reader (although I try), so it doubly helps to make it clear that if I or anyone crosses anyone's lines, to let us know and we will adjust the game to make them more comfortable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328303/#Comment_328303" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T16:14:04+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  4:14PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I did with this once:<br/><br/>One of my best GMing experiences was running Suicide Maiden Death Assassins at Recess.  It was someone on the Burning Wheel boards' idea, though I ran it using Riddle of Steel.  Anyway, the premise was that there is a secret order of women warriors in the Tolkienverse/Middle Earth who exist to fight all the threats that "no man may harm."<br/><br/>Now, it helped that I knew all three people who played the game at least a little.  It's also interesting to note that they were all men in real life (sort of disappointing, to be honest, though it was still a fucking awesome game).<br/><br/>But anyway, at the outset I said, "Part of the theme in this game is that here you are, saving the world from danger, but due to the huge sexism of the world everyone is going to try to get you to stay out of it.  So if you encounter patriarchal NPCs who are all like, 'Don't get involved in this adventure, little girl!', don't take that as me, the GM, sending mixed signals about what you're supposed to do."  It was actually in part my attempt to deal with this trope in a lot of adventure fiction, especially involving female or young protagonists.  But the players clearly understood it and I didn't have to feel bad making the Steward of Gondor a raging, sexist idiot.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329089/#Comment_329089" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-10T22:12:04+00:00" title="June 10, 2011 10:12PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great thread!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
