                            Yes, I'm thinking of getting this game as well... but I want to know about the competitive play between players and GM.  Is it "real" competitive play, like you'd see in a boardgame?  Or is it "competitive-like" play... where the GM has to pull their punches?                        </div>

                            If the GM in a BE game pulls their punches, they aren't following the rules and they aren't doing a very good job of GMing this game.<br/><br/>It is pretty brutal and fun.                        </div>

I think it's brilliant. I've played in 3 campaigns. What sort of game are you looking for?<br/>

                            This game was eagerly awaited by me and several people in our group, but it turned out not to be the game for us. Our group typically plays a game for five sessions then moves on. BE works best if you're willing to give the game the time it needs. Each campaign has a set length, which is very good, but it's definitely longer than five sessions. You cannot rush this game.<br><br>Some of our group weren't that into a game where they'd need to dig into the rules a bit. That also turned out to be a mistake. Every player has to be willing to learn the rules. The rules are complex, but if you can handle D20, you can handle BE. <br><br/>Some very important advice:<br/>- In any game you can learn the rules as you go, but there are some things in BE you need to pay attention to at the start. For each type of campaign (there are three types), there's a list of important skills. Give the list to players and make sure they have a solid mix of those skills. It will greatly enhance things later. Of the three campaign types, I advise playing them in order (infiltration, usurpation, invasion). The game works best that way. Starting with usurpation is also OK. I don't advise starting with invasion.<br/><br/>If you want gritty, epic, sci-fi, BE is an excellent choice. Let us know what you decide!                        </br></br></br></div>

                            I've run the Omac demo at a con, and I thought it was awesome. You definitely don't need to be pulling any punches as GM. Honestly, I consider BE a quantum leap forward. I only wish other games were as well-structured.<br/><br/>EDIT: <a href="http://burningwheel.com/forum/showthread.php?t=3284" rel="nofollow">You can read my playtest report if you want</a><br/><br/>The only caveat I would say about BE/BW (and that the books themselves say) is that it really works best when everyone at the table has read the rules. Everyone at the table has to want to get their hands dirty.                        </div>

                            I haven't played BE, but I found that BW requires lots of "book work" during chargen and play. The game is very dense, if that's your thing.                        </div>

                            Tell us what kinds of games you like, too.<br/><br/>I totally recommend it if you like crunchy, tactical games where the crunch means something.  If you don't like complex conflict resolution (combat), modifiers, etc it might not work for you though.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I played some BW and have played BE at a minicon and in one of Luke's demos.  The thing I realize now that I didn't know before is that this is not a "GM reads up and creates a big thing and the players show up to be entertained."  The players really do need to read the rules beforehand.  The group as a whole should start with a small subset of the rules and then work more things in as the game progresses.  In fact, it would be very useful to run a Firefight and maybe a Duel of Wits with sample characters before the actual campaign starts so everyone can get a comfort level with the rules.<br/><br/>The first time I played (and ran) this system, there were certainly a lot of noses in the books because we weren't familiar with the rules and bit off more than we could chew.  I agree with Tony that this game works best in a long-form campaign where you can really settle in.<br/><br/>But having said that, I think the system is awesome and look forward to playing in someone's campaign.                        </div>

                            Thank you, esteemed story-gamers. once again your input has been thoughtful, balanced and useful.<br/><br/>Looks like BE might be a game for me, but not for our group, since the group really has some problems keeping even the simplest rules down, given our infrequent, some-come-just-to-be-entertained type of play.<br/><br/>Even then, there might be some hope if we could play BE with a subset of the group. Any advice on the minimum amount of players you need for a fun game of BE?<br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>

                            IIRC, the reco from the writers was 4 players.<br/><br/>Incedentally, even if you aren't able to play BE, I've used the ideas from the infection mechanics and the Belief/Artha systems in other games.  I've got players lined up for Burning Eberon, still hopelessly mired in the D&amp;D 3.5 mechanics.  (The conversion is like swapping the heads on a Honda B16-- the wires don't always match up just right, but its got enough connections to get the VTEC pumping out an extra thirty horsepower.)                        </div>

I'd really like to get BE, but I know for certain that I'd never be able to play it enough to justify the purchase and the time spent learning the rules.                        </div>

Amen.<br><br>I had wanted to run BE for my HERO group, as they're big SF fans and claimed to be willing to try new games. When I described it, mostly what I got back was, "It sounds like a RTS game" (w/r/t Infection). Ergo, I ended up running Star HERO instead. <br/><br/>(Other than one night of <i>Buffy</i> and one night of BW, this group has been playing nothing but HERO for going on four years now. My D&amp;D groups are pretty similar. This utter lack of interest in trying anything new just baffles me sometimes.)                        </br></br></div>

You could join us for the next Gotham Gaming Guild. The current season ends this Friday. We'll probably start again in February or so. We meet every other Friday for 6-7 sessions in Manhattan from 7-11pm. This season included a Sorcerer, Paranoia, Mortal Coil: Star Trek, Deadlands, Unisystem, Wrestling, Usagi Yojimbo, and a Burning Empires game. There is usually a low admission fee to cover rent. Besides the GGG, I'm in 4 other semi-regular games and probably play with different players from a group of easily 40+. You may even be able to get a game going with some of the Burning Empire crew that wrote and helped playtest the game. Don't get me wrong, scheduling is very, very tough. I haven't been able to get in more than 1 phase in, 6 sessions, with Burning Empires. But that's mostly because the people I play with prefer to change games every few weeks.                        </div>

                            I have not one but two BE campaigns going with one on the way in January and a convention series I am kicking off at Dreamation.<br/><br/>I think it is a must have for nearly any sci-fi rpg fan.  Will it be for every group?  No.  But it's a book I think hard core gamers should read, even if it becomes a coffee table book.  Like someone mentioned, it is chock full of great advice and interesting direction.<br/><br/>Yes, a group needs to buy in.  I have not found it to be difficult.  Since the game is in the hands of everyone I really just focus on the bits that get played.  Sure, I prep them for it (read this page to this page) but we know when conflicts are going to arise and generally have a good idea what sorts of conflict they are going to be.  It's been very rewarding.<br/><br/>Here is our play groups postings about one of the games...<br/><a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/SufferNot/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/SufferNot/</a><br/><br/>Any specific questions please feel free to send 'em on over. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Even though Mikael's question in the OP has been answered to his satisfaction, I'm going to chime in to be the naysayer about <i>Burning Empires</i>.  Outside the issue of whether this game is suited to one's playstyle -- and on this point it is perhaps the most challenging RPG I've ever seen -- I'm disappointed with the book as an RPG product.  Yes, it is beautiful and lavishly illustrated, and even has an index.  However, it is poorly organized and sparse on non-rules content.<br/><br/>One has to flip, flip, flip from one section of the book to the other, back and forth, all through character creation and through the game.  For example, to figure out your character's starting equipment, you may have to plough back and forth through the following sections: Character Creation: 8. Resources (pp. 109-113), Resources (pp. 357-372), Technology Burner (373-398), Weapons (pp. 511-523), Armor and Iron (pp. 540-546), and Vehicles (pp. 547-557).  The advancement rules are located before the rules on resolving actions of various types or playing out "maneuvers" (the large building blocks of the story.)  Some key entries are missing from the index (i.e., for some topics, all the incidental mentions of the topic are listed in the index but the primary entry is not listed).  And so on.  <br/><br/>In addition, the book is chockfull of setting bits that are given no context at all.  Sure, some of that might be useful as hooks to jog players' creativity, but it goes way past that; there is so much that is unexplained that it is daunting to new players; you have to make up pretty much everything (what's a coeptir?  what exactly do Devotees to Fire do?  etc.)  This massive book actually has very little information on the setting.  Though it is lavish, it is not really usable as a sourcebook for the Iron Empires it is based on.  Many's the RPG I've salvaged, even though I didn't like the system, because I could use it as a sourcebook for other games, but this is just not possible with <i>Burning Empires</i>.  This book can only be used for one thing, to play BE as published; just like this game can only be played in the way it was intended by the designers.  For some people that's a feature, but for me that's a bug.<br/><br/>While I'm perfectly comfortable with the idea that for other people this is a great book and a great game (we don't all like the same things, and that's <b>good</b>!), I think people who are not already fans and are trying to evaluate whether this is a good book for them should know about these issues.  If you and your group have a significant crunch tolerance and are willing to put in the effort, the aspects I described may not matter at all.  But if you're on the fence and just hoped to learn more about the Iron Empires, this book will not help you very much.                        </div>

                            Anemone, I want to say that although I don't agree with all of your points, I very much appreciate the time you put into explaining each of your points and providing reference. My thoughts:<br/><br/>Crunch? Yes! On the same level of D20.<br/><br/>Poorly Organized? No way! Your examples on flipping to later chapters to buy and customize equipment is correct. But that's the case in almost every other RPG I've ever played. It's the case with most editions of D&amp;D. <br/><br/>Setting material included? You are correct that the game doesn't repeat the material available in the graphic novels. It says so in the front of the book...
<blockquote><cite>Burning Empires, Pages 9-10:</cite><br/><b>Reading Material</b><br/><br/>This game is designed so that the players can create stories similar to those found in Christopher Moellerâ€™s comics. All of the mechanics and descriptive color focus on that task, which makes the game fairly alien reading material. It certainly doesnâ€™t read like one of Chrisâ€™ comics. Nor does it attempt to dump Chrisâ€™ setting into the lap of the reader in the form of 30 pages of fiction. Instead, the setting is portrayed in the fabric of the game mechanicsâ€”the feel and structure of the comics emerges in play. In fact, the text presents the barest of details, hints of setting and culture in order to spark your imagination so that you will go and create your own unique worlds. If youâ€™re interested in more setting, background and fiction, buy Faith Conquers and Shevaâ€™s War from Dark Horse Comics, www.darkhorse.com. They are excellent comics.</blockquote>
For me this isn't an issue and Luke is extremely clear and up front about it. Most of the superhero RPGs I've bought and played did the same exact thing. But this is a very good point to bring up for those who are interested in purchasing Burning Empires as purely reading material or a sourcebook for the Iron Empires. This is not its purpose. In my opinion you are correct that BE is best at one thing, to play as a game, a unique game as detailed by the book. That works for me!                        </div>

FWIW, I did not find this to be an issue when I ran a BE event for a local con. Whatever the organization issues may be with in-game reference, I found it well-suited to reading. I.e., the sequence of chapters is conductive to learning the game on a read-through.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Anemone</cite>In addition, the book is chockfull of setting bits that are given no context at all.</blockquote>
FWIW, the info on the setting in BE and the two Iron Empires graphic novels are pretty much everything Chris Moeller has revealed. I found it to be more than enough to capture the feel of his work, make me hungry to play BE, and yet leave ample room for players to get creative. It's reminiscent of TSoY's world of Near.<br/><br/>In contrast, <i>Terran Empire</i> for HERO is more the conventional sort of SF setting book you're pointing to, and, IMO, it does a far worse job at presenting a playable setting than BE. So much time is spent providing setting details that it never gets around to actually telling you what to do with it, nor which details are really relevant to typical campaigns.<br/><br/>I honestly wish more games were like BE.<br/><br/>YMMV.                        </div>
