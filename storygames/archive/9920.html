If I played the game with you, or if you played without me and gave me feedback, I'd like to know so I can credit you. Just write me at my gmail address, which is at rob dot bohl, and tell me what name to use in the text.<br/><br/>This is also an opportune time to let me know if you have any feedback you haven't gotten to me yet.<br/><br/>Thanks everyone!<br/><br/>(PS: I feel weird making this an entire thread/post/whatever, but it seemed weirder to add it to Stuff to Watch.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
