If we have 365 days, how would you break down the various parts of the contest? How much should you design before you start playtesting? How long should each bit take? Since I've only ever made one game, and it was six years ago, and the process was a shitstorm, I'd like some thoughts on organizing the process to do this very thing in 365 days.<br/><br/>Luke, you've designed like 78 games by now. I am among the least organized people on Earth. Tell me some of what you do? How long does it take you to put together a shitty alpha? How do you keep your friends after they muddle through it? How many times do you tell Thor to fuck off while he edits your game?

Or do you just write everything, including the mechanics, even if they might change during playtesting?<br/><br/>It's interesting to notice how much writing, editing and production overlap.

If you hadn't written Burning Wheel or Burning Empires, and you had to write Mouse Guard alone without any help (other than asking questions on the net, like we do), could you complete it in one year? Would it be as good a game?<br/><br/>Also, most of us cannot (or will not) put in 3800 hours of development in eight months. That's about twice the number of hours I work at my full time job in a year. While I admire your dedication, I can't match it. More realistically, if I were painfully dedicated to my project, I could carve off four hours on weeknights and 16 hours on Saturdays and Sundays. It'd take me 105 weeks -- two years -- to put in 3800 hours.<br/><br/>Rereading the thread, I realize that you're just answering the "How do you do this?" question. And the answer is, "By working my fucking ass off, duh." Sorry I'm being such a whiny bitch about it. I'm just insanely jealous of your focus. You made a very brave choice a few years ago to go do this stuff full time, as your only source of income. I don't begrudge you the success you've earned as a result.<br/><br/>Okay, next post will be less whiny.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265121/#Comment_265121" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-02T08:58:09+00:00" title="April  2, 2010  8:58AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, let's say I will set aside 12-15 hours a week to dedicate to game design, including all of my playtesting.

Once you test it, you'll realize that you've forgotten things (and need to write them) and that stuff is broken (and needs to be retested).<br/><br/>As I said to Adam, it depends on the complexity of the system.

This can take time, and it'll take more time when you're trying to design towards an alien spec, one for which you don't have ready-made tools.<br/><br/>What the above means is that when we're talking about the largely noncommercial, artistic indie scene, whether you'll need six months or three years for making your game might have more to do with <i>what</i> you're doing than <i>how</i> you're doing it. There are ways of speeding up the experimental design process as well, but they're not even necessarily compatible with the best practices of evolutionary design; when you encounter a guy who's ordered art for his game before figuring out that he doesn't even want to make the game he purchased art for, that's an example of a design process gone awry because the designer over-estimated the conservativeness of his design; he found out later that he actually was not ready for the development phase yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I'm trying to encourage people to use Skype to playtest my game with me, and have offered to participate in playtests of other people's games over Skype (<a href="http://story-games.com/praxis/comments.php?DiscussionID=120" rel="nofollow">see my thread on Praxis</a>) for mutual benefit. My theory is that taking the geographic limitations out of finding willing testers should make it easier.

They're signing up for something that will constantly promise fun, only to snatch it away because of something that is either a favorite clever idea of yours, or because there's something really lacking and you have no idea how to fix it.</p>\n<p>So, if you get outside feedback, then awesome. You can use it with the rest of your feedback to figure out where your text falls down. But since most of the time, you'll be present, here's what I do, combined with what I've seen other people do effectively.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get a couple of friends to commit. They have to want to see you succeed.</li>\n<li>Play a weekly game. If things aren't working, the people playing with you need to be able to help you figure out what's wrong. They can't just be willing friends, and they certainly can't blow smoke up your ass. They need to figure out clearly what they aren't enjoying, and then be willing for you to stick to your guns and realize that what they think they're not enjoying is not what they're not enjoying. And you need to be able to listen and figure out what's wrong.</li>\n<li>Play that weekly game until it's just too frustrating, then quit. Go away for a couple of weeks and think about it. Your friends will probably not be that mad with you after a couple of weeks. Rewrite things.</li>\n<li>Repeat. Note that we're talking about several months.</li>\n<li>If you think everything went great on the first session, you're totally lying to yourself. Even the things that <em>are</em> working probably are going to interact badly with the things that aren't, once they're fixed.</li>\n<li>A point will come where you're, like, "Hey! We just had a good time for <em>three weeks in a row</em>!" You're going to start feeling like this can work! Now you get to start playing with other people who lack the commitment your friends have!</li>\n<li>Start going to cons. Dreamation has a playtest track, which, while flawed, seems to have worked really well for designers this last year. This is when you're going to start learning how to market your game, because you're going to need to get players. If players aren't coming, it's because you aren't marketing well, and that should tell you something.</li>\n<li>Keep doing it!

Before I ever announced It's Complicated or posted my first post on Story Games or, well, basically did anything remotely involved with the indie community except have a blog two people occasionally commented on, I found playtesters. The fine folks on IRC playtested my game three or four nights a week, one-shots, for six months. I didn't really know most of the people who played in these playtests before I showed up with a game, either. This is what I think about playtesting:<br/><br/>- If your pitch doesn't get people jazzed about playtesting your game, refine it. If it still doesn't get people jazzed, scrap it. My first game concept was something people constantly told me sounded fascinating and important. When I asked if it was something they'd play, they said no, but assured me "someone" would. I never found that elusive someone, so I scrapped it.<br/><br/>- Go wherever the playtesters are: cons, IRC, local gaming stores, game clubs, bribe friends with dinner, whatever it takes. Don't shy away from trying your game at a con because it's not made for one-shots. (Luke and Burning Wheel being the great example here.) If people play your game, chances are excellent that they're going to play it under less than ideal circumstances sometimes ANYWAY, so it behooves you to try playing it that way yourself: then, you can give advice to other people who want to play it but only have less-than-ideal circumstances in which to play it. <br/><br/>- Really, really listen to advice from your playtesters. I know a lot of people say you shouldn't try to make everyone happy, and don't design by committee and blah blah blah. But playtesters can't feel like you're wasting their time. If you're having the big group talk you should have after every session about what worked and what didn't, and there's a general consensus that something isn't working, agree to change it for one session and see how it goes. I think one of the reasons my playtesters were so enthusiastic and willing to come back multiple times a week to try again is because they knew that, the next time we played, the rules would be altered to reflect their input. Now, the finished product, after all of those alterations, was 85% identical to my initial draft. Almost every change I made ended up reverted to the initial way we played. But in the process all of us learned a lot about what made the game work, and most importantly, they felt listened to. If you are receptive to critique, people will be more likely to take a chance on your game: they feel that if it's not fun now, their investment was worth it to make it fun in the future. If everyone tells you to change something and you won't even <i>experiment</i> with the change because it "ruins your vision," no one will want to playtest with you. <br/><br/>- External playtesters, at least with IC, didn't require a name or reputation. It just took people who'd played in my IRC games getting excited about the text and bringing it to their local game groups. I feel like, if nothing else works, getting people excited enough about your game to play it when you're not around is key.<br/><br/>- If you say "But there are no playtesters," re-read from the top.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265449/#Comment_265449" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-04T11:27:14+00:00" title="April  4, 2010 11:27AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>External playtesters, at least with IC, didn't require a name or reputation.

We were drawn to the game because of the setting and the style, not the designer.  Your game has to be really interesting to folks for them to walk willingly into the play-testing wood-chipper.  (Of course, it helps to have lots of other folks also playtesting and talking about the game, which is where the designer reputation comes in).\n<blockquote>I think one of the reasons my playtesters were so enthusiastic and willing to come back multiple times a week to try again is because they knew that, the next time we played, the rules would be altered to reflect their input.</blockquote>\nAbsolutely.  It was really helpful for the morale of our group to see that the feedback we gave took root- Vincent (and others) acknowledged it, responded with questions and answers, and ultimately made some changes that reflected our experience.  That made it worth doing the work to find the fun as well as the bugs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Much more important to watch them play. Watch what they do. Listen to them -- to their actions, their questions, their interactions. Make notes, mental or otherwise.<br/><br/>At the end of the session, maybe I'll ask a few questions. But largely they're for show. I don't really care if you had fun or not. And I certainly don't care about your opinion on the design.</blockquote>\nI don't design games, but I do test software &amp; websites for a living, and this is worth emphasizing. Most people are terrible at reporting on their own experience -- even when that experience was all of fifteen minutes ago. This seems doubly true for anything involving design or interaction with complicated systems. You need someone external to the process who has a disinterested understanding of the processes involved -- I have watched people struggle for ten minutes to find information on a website who report, five minutes later, that they found the site extremely easy to use. Do not take verbal feedback at face value.<br/><br/>Of course the same experience tells me that the designer of something should never be the person testing it; it's very difficult to step outside your own mastery of the systems (you made them, after all) and get the perspective necessary to understand why other people are struggling.<br/><br/>I am curious, though, if people have begun to record playtest sessions -- audio or video -- and whether they've gotten any value out of a post-game review of said recordings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265844/#Comment_265844" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T17:26:42+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  5:26PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>I am curious, though, if people have begun to record playtest sessions -- audio or video -- and whether they've gotten any value out of a post-game review of said recordings.</blockquote>\nBrad Murray et al do audio recordings of all of their playtest sessions, and then transcribe them and explore them between sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265846/#Comment_265846" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T17:29:47+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  5:29PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>I am curious, though, if people have begun to record playtest sessions -- audio or video -- and whether they've gotten any value out of a post-game review of said recordings.</blockquote>\nI've been recording audio of my playtests (and posting the edited audio as an <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/podcast/" rel="nofollow">AP podcast</a>) and have definitely picked up on things from the recordings that I missed when I was participating in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265848/#Comment_265848" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-06T17:34:31+00:00" title="April  6, 2010  5:34PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 6, 2010 5:36PM by Wolfe.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dan,<br/>\n<br/>\nLuke's warning against Skype gaming aside, Dan Maruschak has a podcast that he does which consists pretty much entirely of recorded Skype playtests.
