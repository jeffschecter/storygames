If there are those who have invested in spellcasting classes, use them more sparingly but the amount and style of spells the Eldritch Knight can be  a guide). In both those scenarios the DM uses the normal monster and dungeon rules.<br/><br/>I wanted to compete with a style of game that's popular in Sweden, games like \xc4ventyr, Fantasy OSG, Nyckelringsrollspelet etc, and with Fantasy AGE.

Losing the proficiency bonus means that their saves are going to be way too low, for example. It also limits your options with the class, since you can't (for example) let them choose a skill or two that they're proficient in. <br/><br/>Some people have run the numbers on a 5e character's expected damage per round, HP, save bonuses, etc. You might be able to dig those up and adjust the Searcher in accordance with them.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453648/#Comment_453648" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-31T05:43:25+00:00" title="May 31, 2016  5:43AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Sanglorian and thank you so much for the feedback! I had seen three completely different takes that all used the name Microlite 5E, including yours, and yours was the first one I looked at<br/><br/>Here's what my thinking was on the points you bring up (not saying I'm right or won't change my mind, just wanting to tell you my thinking so far):<br/><br/>Trivial and trap choices:  The Searcher doesn't have any build choices (except whether they want to use their Identity Mastery ability)<br/><br/>Are the saves really that low? The Searcher saves like the equivalent of a Str 16, Dex 16, Con 16, Wis 16, Int 16, Cha 16 character at first level, 18/18/18/18/18/18 at fourth level and 20/20/20/20/20/20 at eighth level. I was rather worried that that was too high, even without the proficiency (and the indomitable feature, which your version doesn't have either, right?). That's a much higher average save than the typical character -- we usually roll for stats, so where she has an average save of +3, they'll have an average save of +1.6. (Average bonus +1, plus +2 in two).<br/><br/>One big table: I tried to find a compromise between minimal help and big scary table. For example, the hitpoints are derivable from level (she has the hitpoints equivalent to a Con 12 Fighter that never rolls, so 7\xd7level+4) but I decided to put them in there, while I saw the hit dice as so minor and I wanted the teaching opportunity to show the damage bonus and the ability bonus was the same and that was it. But also. The Searcher is designed for players who have help (the DM if noone else). Things like what "1d8" means isn't explained.<br/><br/>Expected damage, HP etc. I just took everything from a Champion without fighting style and the extra crit. Remember that the searcher can do ranged attacks or melee attacks and magical attacks or mundane attacks. I have to be careful, I want to approach but not overshadow Warlocks, Champions etc. I still wanted there to be some sort of reward for those who chose their weapons so that they don't resent the Searcher player. Maybe this was misguided. The Searcher already looks kind of like the best class in some ways -- it'll have to be something only you bring out when the group is OK with one, more or all players having access to it.<br/><br/>Extra attacks: Is your take on Microlite also adjusted with expected damage? The fact that the Searcher gets all of these complicated extra attacks and action surges was because in two of the three Microlite 5e games I read, I couldn't see anything about extra attacks and I thought they were key to approaching damage output.<br/><br/>I thought none of the Microlite 5E I had seen so far had the same simplicity that the Searcher has, and none of them looked like they could mix&amp;match with the full classes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453650/#Comment_453650" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-31T06:12:08+00:00" title="May 31, 2016  6:12AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2016 7:17AM by 2097.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At our table, we don't use the skill system but you'll notice that the attack bonus is the same as ability bonus + prof bonus at every level. So a case could be made for those groups that rely on skill systems a lot that the Searcher could use the attack roll for things they are trained in. At first, I was planning to write it that way ("Use this for attacks and the saves and checks you're trained in, and this for saves and checks you are not trained in").<br/><br/>It just looked very OP to me given that it spans all attributes. I've ran a lot of 5e and my thinking was "Is a Dex 16, Wis 16, Con 12 character that isn't proficient in Perception or Stealth reasonable compared to what I've seen at my table? Yeah, that's a little higher than the median but below the peaks" (I built the Searcher to match a Dex fighter). <br/><br/>Also, I was thinking this: at +4 (levels 4 through 7), she succeeds on DC 12 60% of the time and DC 20 20% of the time. I often use 12-19 DC as my equivalent of Dungeon World's 7-9 result (I.e. I'll have one outcome at DC 12 and another, better, at DC 20) and now,  at +4, the success percentages of saves, checks etc perfectly map to Dungeon World's Fail, Partial and Success (40/40/20 % chance) and we all know how awesome play that can lead to! And I can bring some moves over from DW and AW!<br/><br/>Also, my other favorite DC when I want binary pass/fail is 15. She has 50/50 on those, with +4. A little higher than most characters but still very low. The average character has again an average rolled stat of +1, a couple skills trained with proficiency and one ability increase by level four, so average is +2 on skill rolls. So the Searcher is already better than them even without using the "trained" version. But the non-Searcher classes have the option of having higher "favorite" skills, the Searcher is just better on average, not on peak. Which I think is great.<br/><br/>I think a lot of people are turned off by making mechanical choices (such as strength vs dex) if they don't understand the significance of those choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453651/#Comment_453651" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-31T07:00:04+00:00" title="May 31, 2016  7:00AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 31, 2016 7:25AM by 2097.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having differences from 5e is in itself a very big complexity overhead, and 5e is pretty simple. I've had new players start playing in minutes, what I've used is a combination of a choice between one of several <a href="http://idiomdrottning.org/simple-backgrounds.pdf" rel="nofollow">background sheets</a> where you can roll or circle or write in the margins your traits (and the background stuff was the one part for the Searcher where I didn't want to compromise, where I did want all the choices to go) and one of six pregens (<a href="http://idiomdrottning.org/the_gang.pdf" rel="nofollow">old look</a> -- <a href="http://idiomdrottning.org/nl-gang-whole.pdf" rel="nofollow">new look</a>), and that has worked well. I'm still going to do that at cons, and bring The Searcher, too, just in case. I figure that the typical con audience would want a demo of 5e as it is, rather than a very simplified class.<br/><br/>So I've already gone very simple but I wanted to enable the more "pretend-based" opportunities that the Searcher brings along, and I wanted to make it easier to have people join my campaign at higher levels. My con pregens are level one, and the "new look" variant of them even have a simplified explanation for spell slots that only is true at level one, and what I've done in the past is to take a level 1 pregen and give them hit points enough to match the other, leveled players which is obviously still way too weak. Hence, the Searcher.<br/><br/>But anyway: So simplifying things to this extent brings the inherent complexity overhead of being different ("What's an INT? I can't find it on my sheet?") so it the simplification needs to be singificant for it to be worth it. 1d20 + 5 for attacking, 1d8+3 for damage, and 1d20+3 for everything else. That's it, plus the hp stuff!<br/><br/>Oh! It just struck me that if I change the AC to 15 or 17, the "armor save" house rule that I sometimes like to use (a save to avoid attacks instead of monsters making attack rolls) can be one of these two numbers, too! I always use AC - 12 for the armor save (and ten+the monster's tohit as the DC) [the math looks weird but it gives the same percentage chances as attack rolls]. I'll go with 15 (which increases to 16 at level 4, and 17 at level 8) because then I can just remove the whole AC part from the class! Even simpler! The DM can note that the AC is 15 and making an armor save is the same as any other save! <i>(Edit: I've now done this change.)</i><br/><br/>So now it's really only four numbers: 1d20+5 to attack, 1d8+3 for damage, 1d10 for recovering hit points, and 1d20+3 for everything else, especially saves.<br/><br/>Simon, that's simple enough that you can play D&amp;D! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453652/#Comment_453652" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-31T09:51:20+00:00" title="May 31, 2016  9:51AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Simon, that's simple enough that you can play D&amp;D! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nActually, the only D&amp;D version I've really enjoyed is 4E. I need to have lots of creative freedom. In a game where I get freedom to make up the world, the plot and the themes, that's plenty. In a game where I only get to play my character, I'd want to be able to be creative with that, which is easier in a complex system like 4E. In 4E I can make a unique character with werid combinations and synergies that are genuinely my own inventions and not thought up by the designers. So simplifying 5E is probably not the way to go to make the game more enjoyable for me, unless I'm the DM.

Just that Microlite5E's motivation was to get rid of 5E's trivial and trap choices. \n<blockquote>Are the saves really that low?</blockquote>\nIt's the absence of proficient saves that bothers me, rather than the size of the ability bonus. <br/><br/>(My version does have Indomitable - it keeps all the class features of the 5E classes). \n<blockquote>One big table: I tried to find a compromise between minimal help and big scary table.</blockquote>\nAC is the big one that I feel is missing. I'm not sure how I'd go about calculating it. \n<blockquote>Expected damage, HP etc. I just took everything from a Champion without fighting style and the extra crit. </blockquote>\nThe Champion is outmatched by almost every other subclass in the game, so I don't think it makes a good baseline. Scroll Master is nice, but very dependent on what turns up. \n<blockquote>Extra attacks: Is your take on Microlite also adjusted with expected damage?</blockquote>\nNo, I erred on the side of keeping it as faithful to 5E as possible. But when you're creating a generic class from the ground up, I feel like you have a bit more flexibility to adjust the numbers. \n<blockquote>I thought none of the Microlite 5E I had seen so far had the same simplicity that the Searcher has, and none of them looked like they could mix&amp;match with the full classes.</blockquote>\nYou're right that my Microlite5E, at least, isn't as simple as the Searcher - but it should mix and match with the full classes perfectly. \n<blockquote>At our table, we don't use the skill system but you'll notice that the attack bonus is the same as ability bonus + prof bonus at every level. So a case could be made for those groups that rely on skill systems a lot that the Searcher could use the attack roll for things they are trained in. At first, I was planning to write it that way ("Use this for attacks and the saves and checks you're trained in, and this for saves and checks you are not trained in").<br/><br/>It just looked very OP to me given that it spans all attributes. I've ran a lot of 5e and my thinking was "Is a Dex 16, Wis 16, Con 12 character that isn't proficient in Perception or Stealth reasonable compared to what I've seen at my table? Yeah, that's a little higher than the median but below the peaks" (I built the Searcher to match a Dex fighter). </blockquote>\nI think that's a good idea (using the attack bonus for trained skills). I don't think the peaks will be too high - other 5E characters will also tend to specialise. \n<blockquote>I think a lot of people are turned off by making mechanical choices (such as strength vs dex) if they don't understand the significance of those choices.</blockquote>\nAgreed!\n<blockquote>... and one of six pregens (old look -- new look), and that has worked well. </blockquote>\nThose are stunning! Very nicely presented, very intuitive. The only thing I could imagine adding is colour-coding (e.g. all saving throws in blue, all attacks in red). <br/><br/>Or maybe expanding it, and putting everything that rolls the unmodified stat above the line, and everything that rolls proficiency + stat below the line. \n<blockquote>Oh! It just struck me that if I change the AC to 15 or 17, the "armor save" house rule that I sometimes like to use (a save to avoid attacks instead of monsters making attack rolls) can be one of these two numbers, too! I always use AC - 12 for the armor save (and ten+the monster's tohit as the DC) [the math looks weird but it gives the same percentage chances as attack rolls]. I'll go with 15 (which increases to 16 at level 4, and 17 at level 8) because then I can just remove the whole AC part from the class! Even simpler! The DM can note that the AC is 15 and making an armor save is the same as any other save!

The average save is higher and the median save is higher, at the expense of having a couple of "Don't worry, I've <em>got</em> this" hyper competent areas.\n<blockquote>(My version does have Indomitable - it keeps all the class features of the 5E classes).</blockquote>\nOK, so that's where the extra attacks for fighter comes in. That's good.\n<blockquote>AC is the big one that I feel is missing. I'm not sure how I'd go about calculating it.</blockquote>\nThe original one that you looked at first (since overwritten, unless you saved a copy locally) just stated flat out, in the small text next to the table, that the AC was simply 16 regardless of level. The new version says outside the file, in the "notes to DM" text that the AC is 12 + ability bonus. I.e. it goes from 15, to 16, to 17.\n<blockquote>The Champion is outmatched by almost every other subclass in the game, so I don't think it makes a good baseline. Scroll Master is nice, but very dependent on what turns up.</blockquote>\nI love playing the champion \u2665<br/>I think just because the champion is among the more straight forward classes it makes a perfect baseline to build on. Having pretty much infinite ammo and having your attack counts as magical is also a nice thing.<br/>But I dunno. It's such a tight rope to walk because I don't want the non-Searcher class players to not get <em>anything</em> for their work, but I don't want the Searcher player to not be able to contribute. It's already one of the best ability check classes in the game (becoming all twenties as soon as level 8) and it's a good enough damage dealer.\n<blockquote>You're right that my Microlite5E, at least, isn't as simple as the Searcher - but it should mix and match with the full classes perfectly.</blockquote>\nOK, that's good.\n<blockquote>I think that's a good idea (using the attack bonus for trained skills). I don't think the peaks will be too high - other 5E characters will also tend to specialise.</blockquote>\nSo that's a possibility for those who wish to do so. The attack bonus is always equivalent to the highest stat + prof and it matches the Fighter level for level. I thought using the untrained stat was a good compensation for having every stat high. Their average at level one is +1.3 if they're proficient in a third of all checks, compared to the Searcher's +3.. Yeah, I don't mean to sound so defensive, I'm glad for the feedback of course.\n<blockquote>Those are stunning! Very nicely presented, very intuitive. The only thing I could imagine adding is colour-coding (e.g. all saving throws in blue, all attacks in red). <br/><br/>Or maybe expanding it, and putting everything that rolls the unmodified stat above the line, and everything that rolls proficiency + stat below the line.</blockquote>\nThat's how it already is, isn't it? Looking at the cleric. The Mace attack, Religion skill, Wis Save, Medicine skill and Cha save all use the lower number, which is proficiency + stat, and everything else use the higher number, which is just stat.<br/><br/><br/>Glad you like them, feel free to use 'em! (And, you can see why I haven't found much use personally for other Microlites because these are already pretty simple, and they're technically 5e RAW except for the armor save thing.) Take note about the spell slots thing on the backs which need to be rewritten for higher levels, it's written as if level 1 slots is all that exist in the entire world.\n<blockquote>The Players Roll All the Dice is something I'd like to do as a house rule for Microlite5E too. </blockquote>\nIt's something I always think that I'm going to use much more than I ever do in practice. I think over these two years with close 50 sessions I've called for an "armor save" maybe three or four times. Two that I can remember. Very memorable and good moments (both were surprise attacks from snakes), but it's never found its way to be part of my everyday routine; it makes the action economy a little unclear.<br/><br/>But I've found that putting armor saves on the pregens still work fine, I can just add 12 to get their AC and note that AC on my list of PCs. And in the new version of the Searcher, the generic ability bonus, saving throw, everything modifier also serves as Armor Save and then gives me as DM the AC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453658/#Comment_453658" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-31T13:32:38+00:00" title="May 31, 2016  1:32PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The intent with the "new look" pregens was to have every ability modifier in a trained and in an untrained version.

What do you do?" and we'd be talking and then if we got to a place where we needed to make a roll, I could have them roll a d20 and add +5 (if attacking) or +3 if not attacking and that'd be "right" according to the Searcher.

That means you have to roll 15 or higher on a twenty sided die; but you good at fighting so get to add five to the roll."

Like the entire HP, attack, etc etc everything was new. But the player plays other heavy games (such as advanced civ) so I went ahead with the full rules for them instead of "searcher" rules. I'm thinking here is someone who will, in time, find the crunch rewarding. Just giving them searcher while the rest of us spend so much time talking about dice and numbers and builds might be a bit boring.<br/><br/>I gave them Dungeonesque which is a 3rd party reprinting of Basic D&amp;D, with some things rephrased. There's just the basic D&amp;D classes (life cleric, evoker wizard, champion fighter and thief rogue). And I've been referring to Dungeonesque all the time while playing now for a couple of sessions. And today their pregen died so we rolled up a new character together.<br/><br/>I still love the searcher and I know people who are going to get searchers if they show up. It's just some people it's a hard call, and it's a heavy consequence if I guess wrong (they might leave).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474643/#Comment_474643" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-10T19:33:02+00:00" title="June 10, 2018  7:33PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting. Can't you just be upfront with the player about the conundrum, and let them know they can switch at anytime, if they find it overwhelming (or underwhelming)? Or have you found that people can't judge that for themselves very well?<br/><br/>(On a sidenote, this is one of the reasons I don't play modern D&amp;D. The weight of rules and math and exceptions and corner cases makes it hard to play with anyone who's not already well aware of all the ruleset.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474648/#Comment_474648" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-11T05:49:31+00:00" title="June 11, 2018  5:49AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that's right, the searcher has that ability built in also just in case I forget it. I called it "Identity mastery". So I can err on the side of the searcher if I'm unsure.<br/><br/>Yeah, what happened last night was that we lost a PC because everyone, including me as DM, forgot to tell the new player that clerics have Turn Undead. (Which is fine, and it's not certain it would've helped, there were a lot of ghouls.)<br/>I pretty much forgot that they <i>had</i> it.<br/><br/>But in this case I'm, hmm, pretty sure that this player is one where the road to system mastery is going to be interesting and worthwhile, and grow to be part of the appeal of the game for them. It's just someone who is so completely and utterly new.<br/><br/>The hyper-procedural nature of this particular campaign is also a big factor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
