I mean, there are angry guys who insist that "role-playing" means a powerful GM and a handful of players, full stop.  Which seems oddly prescriptive to me, even if that is your personal preference.  My definition is considerably more liberal, and I confess that I don't really know where the boundaries are.  Are you playing a role?  You play a role in <i>Shadows Over Camelot</i> - is that a role-playing game?  What's the farthest you're willing to go and still identify the activity as a role-playing game?  Do you have a definition?  As a thought experiment, can you create a game that lives absolutely on your personal line between role-playing and not role-playing?  What's it like?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104734/#Comment_104734" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T06:08:58+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  6:08AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK.

For example, in Clue everyone has a character piece and a checklist and some rooms. It's all very evocative, and since you're doing guesswork and elimination work through the game there's a sense of role too.<br/><br/>What would tip the balance for Clue being a roleplaying game in my mind is the moment that translating the board/game into our imaginations became more important than the actual physical board itself. Similarly, when our characters were more constructs of speech and action than they were plastic pieces.<br/><br/>So, if we started acting in character and making a lot of off-colour period piece jokes, and taking on accents, and saying "A HA! I've got it! I've solved the mystery!", it suddenly feels like a roleplaying game to me.<br/><br/>Inversely, if in D&amp;D (3.5, say) people start focusing more on which model they are and on which 5 foot square they are on, rather than focusing on what that represents (ie, story and character and conflict), it ceases to feel like a roleplaying game so much as a miniatures game.<br/><br/><br/>Now, I don't know if this is a "rule", because I only just thought this answer up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104749/#Comment_104749" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T06:44:19+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  6:44AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really have a hard and fast rule and despite trying to think one up, I can't.

If the imagined content is color, but never impacts the resolution of any mechanic, then Not A Roleplaying Game. If what a mechanical cue represents in the fiction changes how it interacts with other mechanical cues, then Roleplaying Game. <br/><br/>My edge case: Games in which all the fiction:mechanics linkage happens at design time instead of during play. You design a character/setting/situation, instantiate that fictional entity through mechanics, and then set the mechanics in motion, but they behave deterministically from there. This is common in computer RPGs, for example, and is sometimes held out as the ideal for a certain strand of (non-GNS) "Simulationist" play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104756/#Comment_104756" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T07:16:49+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  7:16AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have no idea, and I enjoy related activities in any direction sufficiently that I am not all that interested in figuring it out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104757/#Comment_104757" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T07:21:54+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  7:21AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 11, 2007 10:20AM by J_Walton.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In August of last year, I posted this, after talking with Brand, under the title, "I Can Make You Do Anything":<br/><br/><i>I recently began suspecting that the reason I love roleplaying as a medium has a lot to do with the infinite canvas. I can tell roleplayers to do anything, absolutely anything, and they will be game for it as long as it's part of an entertaining "game." That's really astounding.<br/><br/>It's sorta like scripting a piece of performance art. I could write a game for, say, 1 mature female, 1 boy child, a pianist, and a puppeteer. The woman and boy are Mary and Jesus off buying groceries at a market in Egypt (they're still hiding from Herod). The pianist and the puppeteer collaboratively create the people and situations they encounter in the market, based on guidelines I lay out. Jesus and Mary react to these situations.<br/><br/>AND PEOPLE WILL ACTUALLY PLAY THIS! Isn't that nuts?! And that's not even half the things I can get people to do, just by writing a "roleplaying game." And that's SO INCREDIBLY AWESOME.<br/><br/>To reinterate, what does "roleplaying"\x9d mean anymore?<br/><br/>I'd argue that it has come to mean <b>people intentionally and collaboratively creating an experience.</b><br/><br/>It's merely traditions and context and shared vocabulary that provides form to all this and makes it seem like a collective whole when really it's a host of very different activities. How many different ways can you "create an experience"? How many different kinds of experiences are there?<br/><br/>Our river has run into the ocean.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104769/#Comment_104769" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T08:11:12+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  8:11AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm..

Go ahead and invite pals who you think would like it." and doesn't do all that much else.<br/><br/>For me, RPGs have very little to do with pretending to be a character. I almost always ended up GMing, and at some level I like that end better anyway. To me, it''s all about the creation of an imaginary "world" even if the significant part of that world is only as big as 4 characters in a small setting+situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104808/#Comment_104808" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T09:41:12+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  9:41AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 25, 2007 9:45AM by eruditus.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am going to try and make this useful...<br/><br/>To be honest I have begun separating myself from that term.  I feel that due to all the games that have that label it seems to have no good definition.  I mean there are games you can "role-play" and I can't say they aren't roleplaying games but they are distinctly different from my normal activities.  I also do not really consider much of the role-playing I have done in the past to be truly a RPG but more appropriately was collective story-telling.  I would not have considered D&amp;D an RPG but more like a miniatures game.  However, there are about 1 million people that would disagree with me.<br/><br/>I prefer to begin separating out my gaming experiences by what I am trying to accomplish and to be honest, due to the societal baggage, I try to divorse any of them from RPG.  Story Game, Tactical Game, Collaborative Storytelling.  Although not perfect I think these start to be more useful labels for describing my activities.<br/><br/>As such I wanted to mention that with my new game, <a href="http://www.realityvault.net/blog/games/2007/10/here-is-first-glimpse-into-my-new-game.html" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://www.realityvault.net/spiral/inevidability_small.jpg" width="30"/></a>, I have decided to not label it at all.  I'd rather the instructions for how to play and word of mouth define it.  It's part of the thematic component and a little experiment of mine (I think I mentioned this somewhere else as well...stupid brain).<br/><br/>- Don                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104812/#Comment_104812" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T09:54:59+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  9:54AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 25, 2007 9:59AM by komradebob.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Out of curiosity, where is the line seperating a minis game from an RPG that utilizes minis?<br/><br/>Understand that, as a gamer who uses minis and is interested in related design, I also frequent minis-wargame sites.

With that I gotta say, for me "roleplaying" for the sake of an RPG is very much "pretending to be somebody else", and not just in the sense of putting on a show, but in the sense of imagining myself to be somebody else. (The two aren't completely disconnected, but they're not exactly the same either.) And yes, that's a pretty restrictive sense compared to what a bunch of other people, particularly hereabouts, seem to think of as "roleplaying".<br/><br/>Now, putting that into "roleplaying <i>game</i>" is trickier since as a few here have pointed out, you can roleplay (by various definitions) in a game of Monopoly or as part of therapy or training, or in the course of writing a story, or whatever. I don't think of Monopoly or even various wargames as roleplaying games, though some of them come close, especially when they have multiple players, individual characters as pieces, a "world" as the board, etc. It's hard not to be prescriptive actually since we're now talking about a specific implementation of tools/rules to support or allow roleplaying.<br/><br/>With that in mind, I look at "RPG" as games which pretty much don't work unless you have an element of "roleplaying" (as described above) in them, or to put it a little more positively, games whose primary purpose and attraction is "roleplaying".<br/><br/>So I have at least two borderlines. Some of those wargames like <i>Magic Realm</i> or even <i>Diplomacy</i> have a lot of roleplaying attraction in them; what takes them over the line, though, is that they can be played completely functionally as abstract challenges with clearcut victory conditions. And then there are a number of "story games" which fail the "pretending to be" test, even if they might be great at what they do. Based mainly on reading, <i>Polaris</i> lies just over the border, because of all the out-of-character negotiating and no real "stance" restriction. The as-yet-unfinished <i>Star Moon Cross</i> probably lies on or just inside the border.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cydmab" title="cydmab"><img alt="cydmab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cydmab">cydmab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104899/#Comment_104899" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T16:48:18+00:00" title="October 25, 2007  4:48PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't "know it when I see it" - there's still lots of times when I'm not really sure.<br/><br/>A borderline case was a diplomacy game I played in where there was ALOT of lying and doublethink.

The former would seem to exclude games where the importance of the shared imagined space goes to zero, and the Individual Imagined Spaces become paramount. Not sure how to define single-player RPGs in that context either. The latter means alot of games flip from roleplaying or not roleplaying depending solely on the intent of the designer. I guess it could be modified to intent of the players, but then we'd have to grant that Monopoly could be a roleplaying game, if the players wanted it to be.

That's my border case I suppose. For me it doesn't have anything to do with minis - I love minis and have used them to great effect in deep RP games.<br/><br/>Another border case for me is "Chrononauts". Its a non-costumizable card game. You have an ID and sometimes I can really start to get into the head of the ID I'm playing, but then my ID gets switched by another players and there goes the RP! <br/><br/>I think "Knights of the Old Republic" I and II and Jade Empire are the only computer RPGs that came close to being  roleplaying games for me. These games were about relationships and making choices in those relationships that affected the story, your character's powers, and the overall play and feel of the games. I'm currently playing Oblivion and with infinitely more plot/quest/character choices than KOTOR it still feels far less like a roleplaying game because you aren't really interacting with other characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105073/#Comment_105073" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-26T18:53:34+00:00" title="October 26, 2007  6:53PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, a role-playing game is a game in which you play a role.  Similarily, a story game is a game to create stories.  There are some things that are both role-playing game and story game (<em>Primetime Adventures</em>), there are some things that are story games but not role-playing games (<em>Universalis</em>, <em>Once Upon a Time</em>), and there are some role-playing games that are not story games (<em>Arkham Horror</em>, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>).  And there are other, finer distinctions to be made: "narrativist" games, games to play with your kids, and genre-emulation games of whatever stripe.<br/><br/>It's one of the reasons why my games are all labeled with something more than "Role Playing Game."  <em>FLFS</em> is a roleplaying game of character.  <em>Sons of Liberty</em> is a roleplaying game of freedom and badassery.  <em>Conquer the Horizon</em> is a roleplaying game of discovery. Sure, those three are all roleplaying games, but they're all very different experiences, and the labels attempt to communicate that to consumers.<br/><br/>Because I have that very strict definition of "roleplaying game," and because I'm not overly concerned about a given game being or not being an RPG, I can't think of an edge case.  Either you're playing a role or you're not.  That has nothing to do with whether or not you're having fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105186/#Comment_105186" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-28T03:30:23+00:00" title="October 28, 2007  3:30AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I see an empire without borders.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105212/#Comment_105212" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-28T13:39:00+00:00" title="October 28, 2007  1:39PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2007 1:39PM by noclue.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In general terms, I would say anytime you're creating a shared fiction, that's role-playing.

It has me thinking about definitional issues and led me to a place I am not sure what to do with.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, role-playing happens when people act on the motivations of a character instead of their own. I guess that the implication of this definition would be that many story games are often not role-playing games for me. Many story games seem to focus on 'the story' over 'the characters' and my intuition tells me that it means they are sometimes caring as much about the characters as their desire to make the story be cool. I don't imagine many characters are motivated by creating a cool story for the players of other characters as much as their own immediate needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nMechanics in a game can encourage and discourage role playing as can individual interpretation of those mechanics in real life. My definition of role playing is probably an impossible ideal which players can only achieve in limited degrees. By this standard, games are simply rated on how much role playing they contain and any definition of a role playing game is arbitrary. So, I don't think that games can be on the line between role playing and not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, this is only a definition of necessity. I have used and will probably continue to use another definition of utility which is parallel to my definition, but allows me to use the term role playing game with meaning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that I know I am role playing when I care more about the character than I care about the mechanics of the game, though this may be colored by my experience with games in which the mechanics interfere with my ability to role play more than they enhance it. This leads me to the question of how to segregate mechanics between those which enhance my role playing and those which inhibit it. For me, a mechanic which enhances role playing is one which informs my understanding of the character without being an end in itself. If I am doing something simply to satisfy a mechanic, then I cease to role play, but if a mechanic reminds me of a motivation of my character then it isn't a problem. I guess this means that role playing mechanics reflect the motivations of my character.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am now confronted by a puzzle. Does my definition of role playing mean that I am somehow deferential to my character? If so, does that mean that games which give me greater narrative control over my character and the sources of that character's motivations are not as strongly role playing than those in which some external force defines those motivations?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a lot.

And a lot of roleplaying I do <i>isn't fun at all</i>, in the cognitive sense inspiring joy and entertainment. Somehow we've evolved our small but growing player pool from hack and/or slash to deep psychological trauma as entertainment. I have a homebrew system I've made where all hits automatically succeed as killing blows... <i>then you roll to emotionally recover from having hurt another living creature</i>.<br/><br/>I think that's right on the edges of most people's roleplaying, simply because it isn't a fun thing to do; but we all hug afterwards and feel a lot more emotionally healthy; and our wives and families have suddenly found themselves encouraging us to spend another hour or two at the Lacuna game if it somehow means we'll sleep better at night. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105806/#Comment_105806" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-31T18:38:25+00:00" title="October 31, 2007  6:38PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mothlos</cite><br/>For me, role-playing happens when people act on the motivations of a character instead of their own. </blockquote>\nI understand what do you mean, and there is value in retaining that meaning, but I have some issues with THAT way of putting it into words.<br/><br/>Because if role playing happen only when you follow only the motivation of your character, I have really never seen role-playing. I have never seen a role-playing game where you stay at home instead of seeking danger, because the character is afraid of dying. Or where you don't go into adventure, but you stay home, marry your girlfriend, find a nice job cooking or as a farmer, then raise some kids.<br/><br/>If the character was a real human being, he would care for the little bits of life we all enjoy. The smells. The hot summer days. He would enjoy life more. He would CARE more for his (or her) life.<br/><br/>No, the characters in every role-playing game I have ever seen, act and see life more like a character in a story. What's importat it's the stuff of stories. Danger. Adventure. Even when you play real-life stories about falling in love, it's still the way of love you find in stories.<br/><br/>We always treat our characters as characters in stories. What differ from game to game is how much we aknowledge it (the same way a sf novel about invaders from mars aknowledge it's being fiction more than a "docudrama" or a reality show, but it's still fiction anyway)<br/><br/>As I said, I think I understand what you are really saying: that that courtain, that suspension of disbelief, that strong buying into the fiction of the character reality is important for you and some systems damage that.  And I know that you told it in the way it's usually told in internet forums. But I think that putting it THAT way, talking about " act on the motivations of a character instead of their own" is not simply a rather harmless way of saying it, but it's a way of putting it so wrong, so basicly wrong, that tend to push people who use it to the wrong conclusions and cause useless polemics and flames.<br/><br/>I think that it's possibile to retain the meaning without having to use a factual impossibility to say it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

Systems I work with as a hobby are all about roles, stories, dramatics, lives and emotions. Most of the time there are no random elements and some of the time no rules as such at all. Now you might ask what diffrentiates this from storytelling tradition, one word, roles. People in my group have roles, always, and they work trough those roles, even when there are multiple roles per "player". Most of the time there is no forseen goal and still we manage to build meaningfull and most of the time emotionaly challenging story which focuses on characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoundaries of role-playing are quite familiar to me as I work on those all the time. When I cook up history course for 12year olds or WHP event for 30 to 60year olds, its always role-playing but with out games.

                         A roleplaying game has two parts, to me, "roleplaying" and "game."<br/><br/>Roleplaying is the easier of the two, cribbing from a lot of what people have already said here:  it is where people intentionally and collaboratively create an experience <i>through the playing of roles</i>. This might not be the only thing you do in the process, but it's at least one of the things you do in the process.<br/><br/>However, you can most certainly roleplay without 'game'. Longform improv, freeform roleplay, these are not roleplaying games, in my estimation, although they most certainly are instances of roleplay.<br/><br/>To be a roleplaying <b>game</b>, you need 'game' elements. You need rules: mechanics. Concrete, repeatable methodical rules that are beyond social-contract in nature, and that are often used (or at least can be). <br/><br/>As this is a <i>roleplaying</i> game, these rules need to interact with the fiction, and with the roles, ideally DURING the period of time one plays the roles. If all your rules are between-scenes, in the time nobody is actually roleplaying (like, only scene framing stuff), this is what I'd consider an edge case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113551/#Comment_113551" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-11T10:06:31+00:00" title="December 11, 2007 10:06AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me, it's more idle chit-chat than something which could go somewhere... unless we delve back into sacred cow territory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113556/#Comment_113556" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-11T10:24:26+00:00" title="December 11, 2007 10:24AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The emperor has no clothes.<br/><br/>Also, this thread is a resurrected zombie from October, just so people know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4636/the-boundaries-of-roleplaying" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4636/the-boundaries-of-roleplaying" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4636/the-boundaries-of-roleplaying/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F4636%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F4636%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
