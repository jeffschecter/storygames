                    In looking over some of my drafts recently I've noticed that I have a presumably bad habit of shifting back and forth between 3rd person ("players do x and y") and 2nd person ("you do x and y"). I sometimes mix them in the same paragraph, even in the same sentence. Here's an example from my un-play-tested game Manifesto:<br/>
<br/>
"Players each roll two six-sided dice to determine the order youâ€™ll move in. Add the two numbers together. Compare results. Whoeverâ€™s roll is closest to 2 or 12 is considered the most avant-garde, and takes the first move. Play then proceeds from the extremes of the 2 to 12 range to the safe center, with players who rolled 7 moving last. You can re-roll to break any ties."<br/>
<br/>
Is this a problem I should try to clean up as much as I can? Anyone have advice on when to address readers as 'you' and when to reference 'players' etc? Is it mainly a choice of a formal or informal tone? Are there specific published games that do a good job of addressing the reader with consistency &amp; clarity?<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>

                            In my current playtest document, I'm using "you" to refer to the active player (i.e., the one playing his character) in a scene, and when I'm discussing all the players collectively I'm using the third person "players". I'm probably not entirely consistent in the text, but that's my goal at least. Using "you" definitely cleans up the text and avoids overuse of the passive voice, but there are times when I don't want to confuse things between what the active player and the other players are doing.<br/><br/>Dogs uses the second person to very good effect as I recall.                        </div>

                            I'd say that the most important thing to keep in mind is consistency and a clear sense of when you are moving from the third person to first person -- and vice versa. Else you risk confusion and an uneven flow. The weird part is that many roleplaying games seem to handle the shift between one or the other rather casually and so we all tend to read right through the change without too much trouble. Still, I think consistent presentation is easier to read no matter what you're used to.<br/>
<br/>
I'd re-write your example as follows. Altered or new text is in parentheses:<br/>
<br/>
"Players each roll two six-sided dice to determine the order you'll (they'll) move in. (After rolling, players first) add the two numbers together. (They then) compare results. Whoeverâ€™s roll is closest to 2 or 12 is considered the most avant-garde, and takes the first move. Play then proceeds from the extremes of the 2 to 12 range to the safe center, with players who rolled 7 moving last. You (Players) can re-roll to break any ties."<br/>
<br/>
Actually, your text was pretty good. Just a few tense issues. I kept the 3rd person tense, but you could certainly alter it to get 1st person if you prefer.                        </div>

                            For what it's worth, Mark, I'd make it all consistent, unless you're doing something very specific with the distinction -- and explain what that is explicitly in the text.                        </div>

                            I agree with Josh, Mark.  I think it is very important to be clear, particularly differentiating between player and character.  Ask your editor to be looking for person disagreement specifically.  <br/><br/>"Players each roll two six-sided dice to determine the order they will move in. Each adds the two numbers together, and the group compares results. The character whose player rolls closest to 2 or 12 is considered the most avant-garde, and moves first. Play then proceeds from the extremes of the 2 to 12 range to the conservative center, with characters whose players rolled 7 moving last. Re-roll to break ties."<br/><br/>Or, you know, the opposite with "you".                        </div>

                            I've actually noticed that my translation of Tenra Bansho (cranking through all the rules parts) is riddled with 2nd/3rd person switching, sometimes even in alternating sentences.  <br/><br/>I will have to pay my editor well (once I get one) to correct this mad bullshit I have spewed (I basically paid less attention to the fine details of grammar so that I could speed through the translation faster).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>
