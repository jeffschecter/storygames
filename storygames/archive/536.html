                    This is a thought experiment based on the premise that role playing games never evolved from war games in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Arneson, Gygax and friends were satisfied with their miniatures battles and didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t develop Chainmail, Blackmoor &amp; Dungeons &amp; Dragons... and the rest is alternative history.<br/>
<br/>
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve tried to think of some other game/ dramatic/ creative fields that were active in the late 60s/ early 70s and that conceivably could have given rise to a form of gaming comparable to modern rpgs. <br/>
<br/>
For each of these five possible alternatives histories IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve imagined:<br/>
Source (what field, industry, or movement became the wellspring of rpgs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the equivalent of war games in the real history).<br/>
Twist (what shift from the sourceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s normal procedures spun off a new field of rpgs)<br/>
WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s different: (how would rpgs today be different given their altered source) <br/>
<br/>
The 'what's different' category is the only one that's really relevant to what people are doing with games today -- and I'm not exactly sure how.<br/>
<br/>
Here they are in no particular order:<br/>
<br/>
Source 1: Social simulation games like Ghetto and Metropolis/ Metro-Apex (designed to role-play social situations and model complex systems) <br/>
Twist: participants kept playing outside of class and the rules were adapted to a range of scenarios beyond the core urban/ sociological focus of the first generation of games. <br/>
WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s different: Many rpgs still address issues of social change and help instill empathy for dispossessed groups. Modern urban/ suburban settings and issues of resource conflicts or alienation are mainstream. <br/>
<br/>
Source 2: Drama Therapy (the intentional use of theatre and drama techniques for therapeutic purposes)<br/>
Twist: practitioners and former patients started engaging in non-therapeutic sessions for the fun of playing roles and experiencing imaginative scenarios.<br/>
WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s different: rpgs can help participants deal with life challenges. Some games start with players identifying personal challenges they want to address through game play.   <br/>
<br/>
Source 3: Improv &amp; Theatre Games<br/>
Twist: Participants began designing clusters of improv exercises/ drama games that supported common themes &amp; scenarios and playing out these scenarios in long form. <br/>
WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s different: warm-ups, switching of characters, re-dos, sessions of mutual criticism, and other drama techniques are built into many rpgs.<br/>
<br/>
Source 4: Synanon and similar group confrontational therapy (Synanon was a drug treatment program that evolved into a cult. At the core of synanonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s treatment methodology was Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe GameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ group sessions where members aggressively attacked and ridiculed each other in order to work through conflicts and expose and fix personal flaws)<br/>
Twist: members intimidated with the game tried it playing fictional characters to build up their tolerance for being challenged Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or ex members wanted to recapture the drama without the deep personal conflict and tried playing in character.<br/>
WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s different: conflicts and confrontations between players are encouraged as sources of drama and revelation.<br/>
<br/>
Source  5: Early maze and text computer games like Hunt the Wumpus and Adventure.<br/>
Twist: Players wanted more expansive and freeform experience without time consuming programming. They invented their own settings, rules and paper/pencil/ object based techniques for graphically representing the scenario on the fly.<br/>
WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s different:  rpgs would focus on forms of play that computers are too rigid to facilitate. Larp-style use of the physical environment is quite popular. <br/>
<br/>
Source 6: Oulipo (Ouvroir de littÃƒÂ©rature potentielle or workshop of potential literature, a French-language literary movement that draws upon constraints to inspire creativity) <br/>
Twist: an offshoot called Oijopo, for workshop of potential games, was formed to explore how constraints (rules) could be used to inspire social, creative play.<br/>
WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s different: rpg rules are viewed as creative constraints to inspire playforms and narration that would not have emerged without the constraint. Game designers often develop free-standing rules as challenges for other designers to incorporate into new games.                </div>

                            Mark, did you come up with this "alternative development" idea on your own?  <b>Awesome parallel thinking!</b>  It's something that Rich Forest and I discussed in January 2005 in Hong Kong.  There have already been two alternative roleplaying games written with this basic concept idea in mind.<br/><br/>Shreyas wrote <a href="http://unrequitedthai.livejournal.com/64923.html" rel="nofollow">Mridangam</a> as if roleplaying developed from classical Indian dance.  We've revised it and that version will be published in the first issue of my roleplaying journal.<br/><br/>And then I wrote <a href="http://100flowers.indie-rpgs.com/waiting-tea.pdf" rel="nofollow">Waiting for the Queen/Tea at Midnight</a> (PDF) as if computer-based "get lamp" text games came first and roleplaying came second.  It's going in the journal too.<br/><br/>I wrote part of an game as if roleplaying developed from Chinese opera, but it's not really playable yet.<br/><br/>Personally, I think this is a great tool for developing alternative style of roleplaying.  If I'd remembered earlier, I would have suggested it to Andy as a Game Chef theme.  Game Chef: Alternate Roleplaying History!                        </div>

<p>I like the Oulipo idea. Always liked what I read about that group since I saw that article in <em>Scientific American</em>.</p>
<p>I'm interested, though, in what RPGs would have been like if they had evolved from radically different fictional sources other than combat-oriented medieval fantasy. Sort of like the article about *Mazes &amp; Minotaurs", which is D&amp;D derived from Homer+Hesiod+Virgil instead of Mallory+Tolkein+Leiber.</p>
<p>What if they kept the wargame influence, but used Napoleonic miniatures and expanded into roleplaying when they tried to emulate Jules Verne and other fantastic science-adventures about exploration?</p>
<p>Or what if they were influenced by Clue instead of wargaming and inspired by the Sherlock Holmes stories? Lovecraft would have crept in a lot earlier, for sure, but CoC what look a lot different with Clue's randomized-mystery influence.</p>

                            Jonathon: yeah I don't recall seeing this explicitly discussed anywhere although who know's what threads I'm forgetting. The Oulipo &amp; simulation game possibilities have been in my mind for a while and reading something about early computer games &amp; the 60s counterculture yesterday sparked me to think of a few more.  I really like the idea of designing games based on an alternative origin. I'll keep an eye out for the journal.<br/>
<br/>
Talysman: check out the Oulipo Compendium if at all possible. A card pattern technique to create detective novel plots (from a real Oulipo offshoot) was the inspiration for my 2004 game chef entry and one of my nine dictator games ( http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18720.0)  If I spoke french I'd be totally into forming a real oujopo.                        </div>

                            What if the primary split had been from a different sort of game, not wargames but boardgames as a whole?  Like this:<br/>
<br/>
Source: Boardgames (Clue, Monopoly)<br/>
<br/>
Twist: Players just want a little more, some human context to hang the dice rolling and card swapping on.  <br/>
<br/>
What's different?  There is no default setting--the diversity of boardgames filters down into a diversity of rpg's.  Combat is not the default problem for early rpg's--social conflict (Clue) and economic conflict (Monopoly) enter the fray.  The popularity of boardgames feeds into a broader base of roleplayers.  A normal gaming session is shorter and more self-contained, meant to be played through over the course of a single evening.  <br/>
<br/>
More rpg's aimed at a young audience (Candyland, the rpg) and with a stronger 'moral lesson' component (Chutes and Ladders where children can discover how it feels to help each other (up ladders), to be mean to each other (pushed down chutes), where the goal ends up being "remember how it felt to be pushed down the chute?  Wouldn't you rather be helped up a ladder?").<br/>
<br/>
With the kiddie audience, a small but vibrant community of gamers curious about diceless play in a more robust sense, where color, sound, and objects become potential randomizers.                        </div>

                            There were some games like this, in the early seventies.  My parents had one called "Encounter" which was designed for party play by adults, where each one had a dossier full of little details about their character.  They were supposed to pretend to be that character at the party.  The dossiers were full of little hooks and drama elements.                        </div>

                            Wow, great thread.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I do like about the Host a Murder games is that they have extremely strict limitations on how the game is played - although you're not really playing a role (the murderer for example does not know he's the murderer until the last act), the speculation and discussion is very very focused. I think there's probably something in focus that branched off into generic games in the hobby early on, with all the people that wanted D&amp;D to "do more", and the burst of generic systems...                        </div>
