Smith the brainer is still working for him (Jackabacka wants to kill Balls). The Angel Key and Killer the Gunlugger are still undecided.<br/><br/>Actually Killer has mist the last two sessions (session 2 and 3) so i will have to prepare a loveletter for him anyway. To get some time moving and slow down the action our next session will pick up 1 month later. This gives Oz the Savy enough time to put his gang together and work on the old factory building where they will be housed. <br/><br/>I want a bit of advice on the moves in the loveletters i will put out. Also, should i give my players the letters today/tomorrow or just when we start gaming? I love the feeling of printing them out and handing them to them but some of them will require a bit of thought beforehand so i am not sure if this will slow the game to much, what are your experiences? <br/><br/>This i have for the Savy right now:<br/><br/>yadadada yadaddada yaddaada GANG. <br/>I will put the gang creation list on the letter and make him create his gang. I will also create a namelist of like 12 people that are in his gang.<br/>Then there are a lot of quesions about them.<br/>Who is your second in command? <br/>Who do you trust the most and why isn't he in command?<br/>Who hates you the most? Why?<br/>There is someone you are really happy to have in your gang, who is it and why is he valuable to you?<br/>There was also someone you didn't get, who is it and what else does s/he has to care for? Is she still loyale to the SWAT? Is it about his daughter? <br/>Who here is actually working more for balls then for you? <br/>With whom did you sleep? (he should get his sexmove for this right?) <br/>Who here finds your pet creepy and want's to get rid of it?<br/><br/>You had a first advance against the SWAT 2 weeks ago, tell us about it and roll+hard.<br/>On a 10+ choose 3, 7-9 choose 2. On a Miss it went downhill but choose 1<br/>You made a show of force<br/>You only got slightly injured (tell us who took a bullet)<br/>You definitely reached your objective <br/>You yourself came out okay<br/><br/>Angel <br/><br/>Not sure about this one. I think i should ask where her loyalties lie and why. She also went to 9:00 so she has to do something about it. <br/><br/>You really are in need of a doc and you are the only one here so get a mirror and get to work. (also roll+sharp)<br/>On a 10+ everything fine. Go back to 3:00 <br/>On a 7-9 choose 1 (or 2?) On a miss choose 2 (or 3?)<br/>* you used up ALL of your angel kit (or maybe just 2?)<br/>* it wasn't as easy as you thought so just heal back to 6:00<br/>* You had to open your brain to the psychic maelstorm about it and Shazza took control for a bit*<br/><br/>*Shazza is the Not-Skinner of the hardhold that Key failed to save last lession (she rolled A LOT of 3s that session) and that now lives in her head (5 on healing hands) <br/><br/>I want to do something with this possesion of her in the loveletter too.<br/>This is a new beginning of session move she has to take:<br/><br/>When you try to get rid of Shazza roll +Weird<br/>10+ everything is fine, for now<br/>7-9 the MC holds 1<br/>Miss: The MC holds 3 <br/>The MC can spend hold to have you act under fire if it goes against Shazza's wishes and plans <br/><br/>Is this okay?<br/><br/>She cared about a streetkid named Tao and said she want's him to work for her. Should there be a +hot move for this? I have actually no idea - manipulate doesn't seem right...<br/><br/>Brainer<br/><br/>He made an enemy out of Barker. I think i want to resolve this, or give him the chance to do it with this letter. (Barker also has his Brainwave projector stashed away)  <br/>You got confronted by Barker so roll +hard<br/>10+ you killed that fucker<br/>7-9 choose 1<br/>* You gave him a good beating but he is still alive<br/>* The SWAT is pissed at you<br/>* His family (Martini and Goldie) knows you did it<br/><br/>You also had a chance to put some in-brain-puppet strings on 2 people. Tell us who it is and how you did it. Roll you move normaly and use your result for both cases. Tell us the command you gave them. <br/><br/>Gunlugger,<br/><br/>this is hard. I have to ask what he did for two months. I will give him 3 options i think. <br/>* Raiding with the target gang (why? They are fuckers and they killed your father)<br/>* Cruising arround with Dany, the driver from a nearby hardhold<br/>* A secret mission for Jackabacka (tell us about it!)<br/><br/>Both Jackabacka and Balls then tried to get him to work for him so i will ask how he decideds (not choosing is an answer) <br/>He is also a mercenary/hitman for hire so he will get a move for that. <br/>You went out to kill someone for money. Tell us who it was (and who ordered you to kill him) and roll+hard <br/>On a 10+ fuckers'dead and you get +1 barter<br/>On a 7-9 choose 1<br/>* You thought he is dead but he isn't<br/>* You caused problem for your client and now he is pissed at you AND he didn't pay<br/>* You got hefty injured, Set you'r harmclock to 9:00 <br/>On a miss - oh you poor poor soul... *evil grin* <br/><br/><br/><br/>This is what i have right now? Seems okay? I think the question stuff is okay but i need 1 or 2 more for the Savys gang. It could also use a bit more scarcity i think, water is actually hard to get...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400326/#Comment_400326" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-10T08:01:40+00:00" title="December 10, 2012  8:01AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here i have the new and (i hope) improved versions of the moves.

Maybe have him choose 3 (or 4) on a 10+? But it's fine as-is, as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
