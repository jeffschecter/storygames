I think the Core Rules introduction sums it up:<br/>"Locus is a set of roleplaying game rules for people who enjoy roleplaying but don't enjoy tedious combat, hard-to-remember rules, large tables, or restricted setting-bound play. Or at least would like to skip out on those things for a holiday of sorts. We made Locus by playing it and playing with it. At the beginning, we had complicated rules, extensive detail and lots of systems. Through aggressive deletion, unification, and simplification of ideas, we now have next to nothing. We\u2019re quite proud of it. The main report from playtesters has been that it's hard to notice the rule system at all. It fades to the background, leaving space for the players and GM to tell the story."<br/><br/>I think it's relevant to story games' interests because it represents our ideas ho how roleplaying should work. We developed it in New Zealand in relative isolation from the outside roleplaying community. I joined story-games after it had been drafted. Hopefully some of the ideas are fresh. There have been a few times where I've thought Locus was relevant in discussions here but didn't mention it. Now I guess I can do so.<br/><br/>At the moment we have Locus Core Rules and a document called Kindling up for download. Locus Core Rules defines the game. Kindling describes a few short scenarios to get started with and offers advice to new players and GMs. You can download them at our website, <a href="http://www.locusrpg.com" rel="nofollow">locusrpg.com</a>. I'm happy to answer "how do you do x" theory questions in this thread. I find modeling different types of games in locus a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Callan, Willem and I look forward to finding out what people think of the rules and how y'all get on using them!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360661/#Comment_360661" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-19T22:16:44+00:00" title="February 19, 2012 10:16PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2012 10:20PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it absolutely delivers on the promise of the introduction.  It is indeed pretty simple.<br/><br/>The main thing I find fresh about it is the assertion that "this is all you need".  Personally, I'm more familiar with needing more or needing nothing.<br/><br/>Actually, I am curious about what you <i>do</i> see this system providing.  If the objective is to fade to the background, and the GM's going to be making lots of judgment calls, then why ever bother rolling?  (I can see many possible reasons why; I'm just not sure which you're going for.)<br/><br/>As for Kindling, I think those are some colorful problem scenarios!  The train to hell strikes me as the easiest and most constrained, while the others offer more freedom for the players to choose the game's direction, which could be good or bad.  <br/><br/>The GM advice seems like a pretty integral part of the tools you provide for play.  Would you agree?  If so, you might want to move it to the core rules doc.  <br/><br/>Personally, I am a huge fan of "Ask your characters questions about what they\u2019re planning to do!" and not a fan of "plan derailment contingencies" and "elegantly redirect players back to your expected direction."  I find the former fun and easy, and the latter joyless and difficult.

That's something that people playing with it have reported a lot. What it's doing behind the scenes is providing a conceptual framework to run games in. It also provides a conceptual framework to build game rules into. The Core provides the rules that we like and use in pretty much every game. Basically, it lightens the mental load of building and playing roleplaying games. Rolling provides an element of uncertainty in the outcome of important actions. The main reason it's included is that having that uncertainty <i>feels right</i>. It's reasonable, I think, that neither player nor GM will happen to know how well your character would feasibly swing his or her sword (for example) at a particular moment. The die mediates. I haven't asked the other developers, but I get a real kick out of seeing the die come face up in a tight spot. I also think it provides a feeling of agency on the part of players. It also gives GMs an answer in situations where they think a character could *probably* do something. It's a whole lot easier on the mind than contemplating the narrative consequences of each possible result. <br/><br/>The neat side-effect of these rules (again, in my experience) is how easily genre and mechanics emerge during gameplay. You don't, I think, have to start with a well-defined system of mechanics for your given setting. They show up fairly easily over the course of play. To a certain extent, it must be admitted that these rules are the product of design through iteration and evolution rather than top-down theory. We use the Locus rules as a language in which to express (and demonstrate) our ideas about specific topics in roleplaying and game design. Core is sort of like the kernel of out RP operating system, if I may use a computer analogy. Most people don't know it's there, but it's still integral to the other stuff that results from its presence.<br/><br/>With regards to moving GM advice into Core, it's worth considering for the next revision. I'll put it down as something to discuss. They're useful for people starting up, but I wonder if the space they take up would hurt Core as a reference.<br/><br/>I certainly agree that it's a lot better to be able to go with the players on the direction their characters take, but Willem points out, it can be a messy thing for new GMs. Contingencies don't necessarily mean attempts to railroad PCs. They do mean having ideas about what to do if the players change their minds and decide to do something you thought was really unlikely. Sometimes it goes okay. In the first session of the first game I ran a couple years back, the others went in (geographically) the opposite direction of everything I'd defined setting-wise, but I ended up rolling with it and a game fell out. I think it would have gone better if I had some idea that they were going to take what I thought was a minor clue that was difficult to pursue as their main objective - I could have avoided the awkward "hold on let me invent the entire landscape in that direction" pauses. It's something you get better at with practice, I think. This post contains my views, of course, not necessarily our consensus.<br/><br/>Hopefully that clarifies our intent a little bit. I feel like it has to be played to be appreciated though. That's my theory. Kindling came from me starting to write an explanation of this sort, and then deciding that it was just better for people to give it a shot and see what they think. That's how we made Locus. (edit: to clarify, I'm not the sole author in Kindling, but that's how the document started)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360825/#Comment_360825" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T12:18:38+00:00" title="February 20, 2012 12:18PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gotcha.

Because if that was all there was, you could just flip a coin with no adjustments rather than rolling a d10 plus skill and difficulty mods.<br/><br/>Er, lemme stop that, and ask, what kind of feedback are you hoping for here?

Even text stuff. The first thing one of the design-types I sent it to said was "increase the line spacing, you're probably using automatic." The thing we want most, of course, is for people to play it.<br/><br/>And yeah, there's that need to have your character and circumstances show up in the roll there too. Character agency in uncertainty, and a touch of what I think people around here call simulation - 'realistic' probabilities of things going your way hidden behind a simplistic interface. It seems off that in running (say) a swordfight that your character has a flat 50% chance landing a strike. Similarly, degree of success and failure is a nice thing to have hints about. As a GM, you describe differently when a <i>typical</i> shield parry deflects a <i>pathetic</i> blow than when a <i>remarkable</i> parry deflects a <i>typical</i> strike. And it feels different as a player. You could probably argue that it also provides incentive for character improvement but that's not why it's there. You could consider the submodel in which everything is <i>typical</i> at everything and all challenges they face are <i>typical</i>. For one thing, you lose a layer of uncertainty. Everything is as risky as everything else. For another, the experience of rolling ceases to be mediated by the character's attributes. It's much less like acting through your character and much more like placing a bet. A constrained version of the game in which flipping is the major mechanic could be built - the GM would only ask you to flip when your character's skill was close to the difficulty of the thing you were trying to accomplish. This, I think, would constrain 'rolling' to be much less frequent, which would mean less of the effects you listed above and less character-skill-mediated interaction. I reckon Locus implies the "right" amount of rolling. It's to be admitted that that's a matter of taste.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360881/#Comment_360881" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T14:55:52+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  2:55PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It looks like it requires specifically players with experience in traditional RPGs, and that it's aimed to players frustrated with such RPGs. It's a valid maketing strategy, though perhaps it's not what you intended in the first place. Reading through it, I still see the resemblance of a more complicated system, so it actually looks like you deleted most of the cumbersome stuff, along with some of the stuff that could help inexperienced players catch on.<br/><br/>I like the skills/inventory/wounds combo. But I'd add an Objective (a goal, etc. call it whatever you want). It's not only a hook the players give the GM to lead them into different challenging situations, but a nice clue of what the players want from the game. However, it's meant to be defined after the setting / story seed / initial scene is framed. And it's not meant to be reached until the epilogue of the story, if it's reached at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pacmouf" title="Pacmouf"><img alt="Pacmouf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pacmouf">Pacmouf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361146/#Comment_361146" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T12:23:12+00:00" title="February 21, 2012 12:23PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi all, I\u2019m the enigmatic Willem Biggles has been referring too. I'm new here to story games, so I'm still finding my feet on the forums. Thanks for all the feedback you guys have given so far, its helped make me aware on how we can improve on the presentation of the system (see below).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think WarriorMonk is completely right, we made the document for people who are dissatisfied with classical role-playing games. In the first instance, those dissatisfied people were us, but the more we talked about it (and found forums such as this), we felt there were other people out there who might share our sentiment. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs David Berg points out, the GM\u2019s advice is somewhat integral to implementing the system. However, the reason why we didn\u2019t include it is because we see the core rules in a very programmatic sense, the core is the basis which other rules are based on. This does not include how to to run games, as that question is for general role-playing advice, and is not unique to the Locus rules per say. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, while this approach is great if you\u2019re trying to gradually build up a system of rules, I think you\u2019ve touched on how it can be a problem with presentation, and leads to a conundrum of sorts:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) If you are a new player, the rules are nice and approachable, but because it contains little advice about how to run a roleplaying game, it might be slightly intimidating to implement with a group.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) If you are a veteran player, its nice and descriptive, easily implementable, but unless you are developer happy and are used to taking systems and building on them (which the core is for), the obstacle comes in building your particular vision from it. Veteran players also tend to expect a bit more rules-meat on the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo solve 1) we should expand kindling with general roleplaying advice, call it "Introduction to Roleplaying Games", include the core rules with it, and make the two the "Core Package". That way we retain our nice modular layout (conceptually speaking), and make it more approachable to new players.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo solve 2) We a) release the Fantasy Package, to demonstrate by example how to create modules around the core and/or b) release an "Introduction to Creating Modules", outlining, and giving examples of how to use and build on the Locus system. Hell, it could be part two of the kindling package - we could add suggestions of how to create modular rules to simulate the particular aspects of the scenarios presented, like \u201cCreating the Dragon in Scenario 2 with Locus\u201d. <br/>\n<br/>\n*pencils down 1) and 2) for Beta release Two*<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you folks think this kinda thing would help at all?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biggles" title="biggles"><img alt="biggles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biggles">biggles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361174/#Comment_361174" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T13:34:54+00:00" title="February 21, 2012  1:34PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2012 1:35PM by biggles.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two things:<br/><br/>2. With respect to adding an objective, I had a think about it yesterday and it's an interesting idea. I haven't played Burning Wheel, but it originates from there, doesn't it? I feel like it's the sort of thing that would be better investigated in an add-on module than incorporated directly into core. Partly, I feel like players are implied to be responsible for their character's motivations &amp; ideas. Also because it's something we haven't done previously, an investigation would be in order. Is it something that should appear wherever the 7 elements of Core do, or is it only suitable for particular types of games? Which (if any) models of character motivations contribute to the style of play we're after? Theoretical investigation can shine light on it, but I think it also needs to be considered using design process.<br/><br/>1. I whipped up a little app for online rolling. <a href="http://locus-roll.heroku.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://locus-roll.heroku.com/index.html </a> Apparently it works on someone's Android phone and it works for me in Chrome. I'm thinking the latest JQuery should be sound cross-platform. Should be a convenient tool for people who are okay rolling on a phone or computer. I have a few more edits to make to make it better, but it's certainly in a usable state at the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361202/#Comment_361202" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-21T15:49:44+00:00" title="February 21, 2012  3:49PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2012 3:50PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so my thought is that your biggest obstacle to Locus catching on is that its core features are familiar.<br/><br/>- remove the need for participants to constantly decide how everything goes<br/>- introduce compelling uncertainty<br/>Almost every RPG does this.<br/><br/>- lighten the load<br/>- fade into the background<br/>Every "rules-light" RPG does this.<br/><br/>- simulate probabilities<br/>- enable action via custom character effectiveness profiles<br/>The vast majority of RPGs do this.<br/><br/>- describe levels of success<br/>Tons of RPGs <i>can</i> do this, though the number of those that <i>make a point of it</i> may be smaller.<br/><br/>If you make a Venn Diagram of games that do <i>all </i>of the above, I'm honestly not sure how many games you're left with, but I would guess that the answer isn't zero.  The popular FUDGE and FATE systems might fall in there.  FUDGE is one of the very few systems I know of to succeed as a "universal system" based largely around resolution, and even it had a special feature going for it: +/0/- dice.  FATE is based on FUDGE, but FATE's success comes from taking that resolution system and making a full game out of it.<br/><br/>I don't doubt that Locus's <i>exact</i> system is new, but I don't think it is <i>strikingly</i> different from a lot of older options.  My opinion is that the RPG community has more options than we'll ever actually explore, and thus "striking" is necessary to make it onto the "must play" list.<br/><br/>If you feel I'm off base, here are some ideas for how you might communicate what I've missed:<br/>- pick the single most unique feature of Locus and describe it here in a way that readers can see how it makes a huge impact on play<br/>- relay an account of actual play that illustrates how the system contributed to a uniquely awesome experience<br/><br/>Sorry to be a downer.  I am actually quite sympathetic to your intent!  This is a general sort of system I like, and I certainly wouldn't be turned off by Locus if a friend was using it to run a brilliant scenario.  For my own purposes, though, I don't think I need to Locus to do what Locus does.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361316/#Comment_361316" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-22T09:42:20+00:00" title="February 22, 2012  9:42AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2012 9:44AM by WarriorMonk.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with David. The intent is really good, I can sort of feel you've got an amazing game there. But the rules as they are written now don't get to convey the idea of the experience you had playing it. I feel the rules are missing a key ingredient that is in the way you play it. Perhaps it's a house rule, a way of playing or an entire philosophy of play that by now is probably coming to you so naturally that it looks as if part of human nature, while it's actually something that can't be communicated by the rules. Most probably it's something that could only be fully understood by watching you play or by an actual play account.<br/><br/>See, this came to my mind since I've been reading recently about how different editions of D&amp;D created different ideas of how the game should be played and understood. I was amazed to learn that the games DM'ed by Gary Gygax himself were lethal to PCs and players didn't had to roll the dice as usually as they had to do in 3.5. It gave me a lot to think about. Can Core books actually transmit the philosophy of play they are intended to? Can it be prepared to keep the fun going even when they fall into unprepared hands? Seeing how many unssatisfied players have been created by games with poor, unaccurate, imbalanced, obscure and contradictory rules, I kinda feel responsible. That has taken me to try and test each of my designs to it's limits into the hands of even abussive players and GMs to see if the system can stand the beating and still keep the game as a fun experience for everyone.<br/><br/>I don't mean to preach, it's just that I think that a game is built of everything: rules, settings, graphics, dice, etc. And in it's very core, a philosohpy of play. All together convey a "mood" that some people would like while others not, and there's no way to avoid that, even if you strip it to it's very basics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_362665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biggles" title="biggles"><img alt="biggles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biggles">biggles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362665/#Comment_362665" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-26T04:32:56+00:00" title="February 26, 2012  4:32AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I mentioned to both David and WarriorMonk, we think that their criticism is worthwhile and deserves proper consideration. We'd all had a think about it and when we saw each other today, it seemed like we had a consensus already. That was cool because it left some time to tie up a few loose ends from the end of our last adventure and have an in-character debate on religion.<br/><br/>The conclusion we reached was that FUDGE certainly has some similar ideas to Locus, particularly in terms of the descriptive approach to roll results and the overall descriptive approach. This is cool. We have a special die too (d10 with symbols denoting --, -, =, +. ++) but not the financial resources or market to produce and sell them. Not that that's an issue - we're not a business. There are a few surface differences between us and FUDGE, like how health and damage work - we don't have damage factors, things just wound you or you avoid it or your protective equipment stops it. These aren't big differences though.  I mean, I prefer working in minor/moderate/serious wounds, but it's possible to chop and change that with the health/damage in FUDGE. By far and large, FUDGE and the Locus core exist in a similar tradition.<br/><br/>The big thing that happens in Locus that I don't see much of in other systems is the breaking down of the barriers between GM and game designer. This happened largely without us noticing because for the past three years or so, when we've been GMing, we've also been doing game design. I think that implicitly this happens in a lot of games as-played. When you play a system or game, you often muck around with its internal workings to get it do do what you want. When you have 150+ pages worth of rules for the 'basics', this can be messy. Our solution is to divide rules into modules. This isn't necessarily new, but it reveals what WarriorMonk would call our philosophy of play. The core rules aren't just the basics required to play the game, they're also the primitive concepts you design with. The game modules are there to make designs reusable and easy to recombine. The fact that each module must list which other modules it depends on means that in theory you should be able to pile modules into a library of mechanics from which to design your particular game without looking inside them.<br/><br/>We also do a good bit of making up rules during games. Recently, Willem limited my minor wound recovery because I was freezing cold without my furs. It's not a shocking new rule decision, but it was effective in conveying that I was freezing. This is what I would call a game-specific house rule. If the mechanic gets used a lot, it might eventually become a part of a wider module of interconnected mechanics. One of the reasons that core is small is because specific mechanics are everywhere. The modules that contain the common cases are built through play. Games themselves have all manner of situations that are best conveyed through interaction, many of which will have to be dealt with by the GM as they happen. This necessitates that the core rules are both descriptive and easy to design with - otherwise it would be difficult to plan quickly or improv design. This process mediates design, planning, writing and play.<br/><br/>I think GURPS has a similar module approach, perhaps with less fine-grained modularity, more money-paying. I haven't played it (oh no) The fact that Locus is Creative Commons hopefully makes it more accessible. We hope that more people than just the three of us write modules in the long run. As the number of modules increases, so does the number of different module combinations that can be used to run a game. Want to run fantasy magic in the 1920s? Cool. Pick the relevant modules (fantasy magic, 1920s pricing/economy, 1920s weaponry &amp; combat,  and do a bit of game-specific prep and you're good to go.<br/><br/>Overall, our approach goes something like this:<br/> - Descriptiveness makes rules seamless with interactions.<br/> - Descriptiveness echoes from core to extension modules.<br/> - Light core makes room for improv, modules, and on-the-go design.<br/> - Modules absorb the delicious byproducts of play.<br/> - This folds back into making description tactile.<br/><br/>That's an initial attempt at explaining, at least. If the post seems disjointed it's because I stopped myself from using a computer metaphor in nearly every sentence. If anyone speaks hacker, I can provide you with what I think is a much cleaner explanation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_362737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/362737/#Comment_362737" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-26T13:18:49+00:00" title="February 26, 2012  1:18PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2012 1:22PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From a consumer standpoint, then, I would say that what I would want from a Locus product is to be taught how to design modules to suit my play needs.  <br/><br/>Give me an example of a situation that could arise in play or prep, <br/>show me how to look to the core rules for inspiration and guidance for my mod, <br/>show me the logic and process by which I can create such a mod, <br/>and then demonstrate it in action.<br/><br/>If you make that look more fun and easy than whatever I do by default when I want to hack a game, then you've got me!<br/><br/>(The core rules would then distinguish themselves by their suitability for this process.  I mean, not that they aren't already cool, but "Made for modding" is what would stick in my memory as unique.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
