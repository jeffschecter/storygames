Though it has worked to get the game off the ground, I often sacrifice my own interest in the premise (as producer) to just get a game off and rolling. I have players who don't game much and 'just want to get to the playing part'.<br/><br/>Not only do IAWA do the setting and character for you, but by picking either from Blood and Sex, a Nest of Vipers, etc., you also pick tone.<br/><br/>So, rather than making Oracles on our favorite settings, you could play with the differing tonal aspects of each setting. When does this setting employ Comedy? Tragedy? Romance? Mystery?<br/><br/>In today's game, I want to play high fantasy with a dark murder-mystery tone. Next week we'll go back to comedy, or the romantic soap opera, or whatever.<br/><br/>I've noticed this on tv shows, where a serious show will have a silly episode just to let some pressure off (Angel's 'Smile Time' puppet show episode comes to mind).<br/><br/>Anyway, IAWA already does this for itself (except for the comic tone that some sword and sorcery has...but maybe VB meant to keep the focus on serious tones).<br/><br/>Anyway, I've realized now that a good PTA episode lies just an oracle away. Setting, character, and tone, all set up really quickly with lots of prompts and ready-made ideas. And as a producer, I can make it a game I enjoy by creating the overall Oracle group, or picking the Oracle group I want to go with. Or collaborating on making it with the rest of the players on a different night, so that we only have to do it once!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
