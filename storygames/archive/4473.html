And suddenly it was <b>on</b>.<br/><br/>We played a quick hour of Versus Mode just to get the feel of the rules.  This is a one-on-one subset of the game that takes place after the American Revolution, as the erstwhile patriots are bickering about how to actually run a country made up of states who have little in common.<br/><br/>I selected <b>Alexander Hamilton</b> as my patriot.<br/><br/><i>I have a hand of five cards when duelling.<br/>I can draw a new hand when dealing with money.<br/>I can claim a joker when using newspapers.<br/>I can call for Heart cards when debating<br/>I can always play single Club cards.</i><br/><br/>Rachel selected <b>Benjamin Franklin</b> as her patriot.<br/><br/><i>I have a hand of five cards when playing the diplomat.<br/>I can draw a new hand when politicking.<br/>I can claim a joker when cultivating a good image.<br/>I can call for Diamond cards when corresponding.<br/>I can always play single Club cards.</i><br/><br/>Alexander entered Congress in his steam-powered carriage.  He strode into the chambers full of pomp and circumstance.  He got the attention of the politicians by slamming his fist on the nearest table and shouting, "Damn it all, we will build a strong navy to protect our country from these foreign interlopers!"<br/><br/>Ben Franklin was much more circumspect as he entered the chambers.  He was wearing a wispy outfit that showed a rotund figure.    He connected with all the influential members, addressing them by their first name.  He narrated a brief and entertaining story peppered with humor that was based on experiences in his print shop.  "We need a better dialog with our constituents.  Don't prattle on so.  Concentrate on representing the people you are supposed to be representing!"<br/><br/>The Versus Bout Sheet looked like this:<br/><br/><i>In Saratoga, the People consider Elitism.  Supporters defend a Congressman after Detractors improve a Sailing Ship.</i><br/><br/>After both sides draw their hand of four cards, Hamilton describes how he goads Thomas Paine into a duel (using pistols with the balls secretly removed) over the question of France, as he knows Franklin supports France as well.<br/>(Hamilton draws a fifth card)<br/><br/>Franklin plays the diplomat as he tells Paine that the duel is a dupe.  "And my dear Alexander, you are a boastful and spiteful young fellow.  Shouldn't you challenge Paine to a private debate, instead?<br/>(Franklin draws a fifth card)<br/><br/>Ben suggests that the debate takes place in Saratoga because they have an influential base of lawyers and educators there.  Secretly, Ben knows that the people of Saratoga are anti-elitist!<br/>(Franklin plays A-2-3 of clubs)<br/><br/>Hamilton makes sure the debate takes place at the Saratoga Free Library, where he has secret Mason friends who are staunchly pro-Elitism.<br/>(Hamilton plays a 4 on Franklin's straight)<br/><br/>Hamilton brings in a Frenchman named Jacques Cliquot who got burned by the French aristocracy.  "This patriot fought bravely for the revolution.  But when he returned to his home country, they cast him aside like the rind of a brie cheese.  Is this a country that we should be trusting?  I say not!"<br/>(Hamilton plays 8-9 of Hearts)<br/><br/>At this point we had been at it for about an hour and decided to break off.  I got a few thoughts out of her before she retreated for the television.<br/><br/><b>Afterwards</b><br/><br/>Rachel:<br/>"It would have been better if Paine took a backseat so we could get the story back to Ben Franklin."<br/>"Ben actually created the public library system in America, so it would be fun to play into his advantages there.  I could totally see him smuggling someone into safety using some secret staircase that only he knew about."<br/><br/>Overall we had a good time with the game, although there was a lot of feeling out with the rules.  I was surprised at how into this game Rachel was as she is not used to the whole concept of role-playing.  But once she got over the initial hump, she totally rocked at putting herself in Ben Franklin's shoes and narrated plenty of content that I just wasn't able to get into my notes.<br/><br/>She is used to (card/board) games lasting a 1/2 hour or maybe an hour.  She was surprised that 60 mins barely got us into the thick of the story.<br/><br/>On page 105 it says, "Draw six cards and find their meanings..."  This should actually say "seven cards" based on the seven spaces on the Versus Bout Sheet.<br/><br/>And speaking of the Versus Bout Sheet, we both didn't really understand how that fit into the concept of debating the merits or lack thereof of elitism.  I could work "defending a Congressman" in pretty easily.  But she was stumped a bit at how "improving a sailing ship" would fit in.  <br/><br/>And is there any mechanic benefit of working in these elements from the Versus Bout Sheet?  I couldn't find anything in the rules about that.<br/><br/>Fun game and we both want to play again!<br/><br/>Chris B.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101271/#Comment_101271" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T09:59:24+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  9:59AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When will this game be in my hands?
