Our interaction is framed by "the system". If the system leaves a lot to player-fiat, it is still <i>the system</i> dictating that this is allowed. System does matter. End of debate.<br/><br/>LOL! The debate will continue, of course. Let it. But please do so in another thread.<br/><br/>This thread is for a talk on "system" and "mechanics" and "rules"; are these three terms equal? Some of you seem to have no second thoughts interchanging them. As a designer and player outside this sphere of terminology, I find that strange, and believe it must be a little befuddling for those of you trying to reach a deeper understanding of role-playing games. It seems to me that the theoretical apparatus we apply to role-playing games is limping. There seems to be little coherence between reality and apparatus, and little understanding of how the applied terms confine our thoughts on the matters at hand.<br/><br/><b>My simple alternative</b><br/>I prefer the term <i>game <span style="text-decoration: underline;">method</span></i>, understood as "the way we play the game", including both <i>mechanics</i> and <i>techniques</i>.<br/>- Mechanics are focused on abstracting a character and giving inspiring results in task/conflict-resolution.<br/>- Techniques are focused on how we influence each other and word the fiction, the important storytelling part of it.<br/><br/>I now understand and discuss how we build and play role-playing games by the term <b>method</b>, with the sub-terms <b>mechanics</b> and <b>techniques</b> ...<br/>- and by pairing up method with the term <b>setting</b> ...<br/>- and by applying something that may be called a <i>design staircase</i>; <b>vision -&gt; interaction -&gt; fiction</b>, to my work as a designer.<br/><br/><i>Vision</i> = the idea, and the game-text expressing the idea of the game (including setting and method). This is the step for design.<br/><i>Interaction</i> = the applied method, the way players act to produce a fiction in accordance with the vision. This is the step for game-play.<br/><i>Fiction</i> = the actual and individual result of the game for each and every player. This is the final step; what the game creates, the aim of it all.<br/><br/>I find that this way of thinking on how we play role-playing games, has left me with a slightly skewed, and fruitful, viewpoint. Some minor problems of communication aside (I have to explain my terms a lot, of course, when discussing rpgs), this simple theoretical apparatus has left me less confused, and more able to pursuit my design goals.<br/><br/>So; what about you;<br/><br/><b>- Do you believe the theoretical apparatus of role-playing games is working?</b><br/><br/><b>- Are there insights to be had by a simple change in applied terms?</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309271/#Comment_309271" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-23T23:32:11+00:00" title="January 23, 2011 11:32PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of adopting more popular use of the word Method, by which you mean Mechanics and Techniques.<br/><br/>However, I like to continue to use the term System, and don't think Method is a suitable replacement.<br/><br/>Because our existing use of the word system in RPG talk is flawed.

The problem is how players/designers really understand and use the term. However nice the definition is, you cannot escape the connotations. They are many, and murky, and a constant problem in discussions on role-playing games. <i>Especially when discussing role-playing games.</i> It is important to recognize that role-playing games (and story-games) have a central element which is not very present in board-games and computer-games; <i>the storytelling</i>. The techniques of dialogue are an important and defining part of any role-playing game. And "system" don't really cover that, in spite of the "wholeness" of its definition. The real definition of it goes by unnoticed: most players/designers have problems placing something as central as the storytelling within the whole of "system".<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>However, I like to continue to use the term System, and don't think Method is a suitable replacement.</blockquote>It's not a replacement. Whatever "system" is used as by other players/designers, I find it well covered by different, and more precise, terms in my simple apparatus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309275/#Comment_309275" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T01:22:39+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  1:22AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hell yes!

Most people use "fiction" to mean only the results within the fictional narrative (i.e. what happens to the characters and the world).  For example, in common usage, spending a Plot Point isn't part of the fiction.  However, it is a part of the result of the game.  It sounds like you're trying to redefine "fiction" as everything that results from a game, not just the fictional narrative.  That's just going to lead to confusion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309299/#Comment_309299" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T07:23:58+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  7:23AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>The use of "system" to mean published mechanics long predates D&amp;D3E.  i.e. the HERO System, etc. Really, no definition is technically correct or incorrect if you ignore context.</blockquote>\nTotally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309302/#Comment_309302" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T07:41:24+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  7:41AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas:<br/><br/>Do you want to talk about this word definition stuff, or do you really want to talk about what you call techniques, and making their role more obviously central in game design and in transferring of play processes between people?<br/><br/>Because the second one sounds more interesting and fruitful to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309306/#Comment_309306" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T07:54:56+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  7:54AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, I like where Dave is going here:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Where play techniques derive from the game text, I divide them into Rules (stuff you must do, and when you must do it, clearly specified), Guidelines (stuff you should do, but with plenty of room for interpretation about when and how), and Advice (stuff you might wanna try).</blockquote>\nHe's using simple English words in a way that doesn't confuse their meaning ("How is an unspoken rule like, 'Amy always gets to choose which game we play next, because it's her house,' part of the System?").<br/><br/>The way to get people to catch on to and use terms you like is to write them successfully into games, I think. This kind of debate isn't really going to get much further than the small number of people contributing to this thread.

Or maybe simply more central. Or better communicated in the artifacts.<br/><br/>It becomes even more interesting to me when considering the possibilities for Technique Heavy/Central design+ Mechanics Lite games.<br/><br/>I'm also tempted to say that we already have some pretty good examples of those around, but the emphasis on the familiar mechanics stuff in the arrtifacts kinda leaves those games and game play stuck in oureripheral vision instead of being in-focus for consideration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309324/#Comment_309324" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T09:50:14+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  9:50AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't like using the word method for as described at the top.  To me, a method is a way of doing something, an at a smaller unit than a game.

I'm talking about using other, more precise terms for talking rpgs.<br/><br/>But your main point is a valid objection: I do not agree that it is something we need to care about, though, so let me try to refute it:<br/><br/>- any new terms are subject to incorrect use, of course, but "system" is already too abused to be useful. And in addition we may think of ourselves as a tad more conscious of the nature and potential of role-playing games as a form now, than back in the 1990s, when the current theoretical apparatus evolved. So we may have a better chance of using new terms with more coherence, and thus avoid the pitfalls of wild-growing connotations.<br/><i>(Oh, how I loved writing "the pitfalls of wild-growing connotations"!)</i><br/><br/>- if all of us invent new language, none of us will be able to make sense. I do not feel this to be a threat; role-playing is a young form, and compared to other forms of expression (literature, theatre, movies) there is virtually no terms to describe it. And the terms we use are imported from other forms, and by origin or abuse, they are not very suitable. So I propose for us to use other terms, more suited to the task, and already part of common language.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>No, inventing new definitions rarely gives any insight.</blockquote>I'm not into "making new definitions". I propose to change the apparatus of terms. I have done so, as described, and believe this to be one of the key factors to my design-progress the last years.<br/><br/><b>John</b>: your lecture on the origins, re-definement, and discourse surrounding "system" is much appreciated. It gives those of us not familiar with the history of the term, a good base for informed talk on the subject. I want to note that I advised Ron against supporting that definition of the term back then, on the sole basis that the term was full of mis-directed connotations. He disagreed, and was in his full right to do so. I believe that as a result the discourse on "system matters" went over the head of most traditional players, and made mutual insights harder to come by. It a itsy-bitzy tiny tragedy.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>Most people use "fiction" to mean only the results within the fictional narrative (i.e. what happens to the characters and the world).  </blockquote>I use it to mean what happen within the fictional narrative, as perceived by the players.<br/>I do not see how you can read my definition of it as if parts of the interaction is included, but I will try to rephrase:<br/><i>Fiction = the narrative each and every player partake in, and take with him from the game. This is the final step; what the game creates, the aim of it all.</i><br/><br/>Better?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>do you really want to talk about what you call techniques, and making their role more obviously central in game design and in transferring of play processes between people?</blockquote>YES!!! :-D<br/><br/>I made my small apparatus with this fact in mind; that none of the terms available was aimed at the storytelling or dialgoue-techniques. Back in the 1990s it felt like the great and diverse field of storytelling and dialogue was completely ignored by key figures in the rpg-discourse. To me is was flabbergasting!<br/><br/>So I would indeed like to discuss techniques, and how to find the right balance of mechanics and techniques in any method under construction. There is a whole field of rpg-design out there mislabeled "GM-techniques", by the sole reason that most rpg-designers have failed to really explore them as tools of their trade.<br/><br/>There has been a development, in spite of this, but I would sincerely like to see terms in use, that made it obvious that this is part of any role-playing game a designer is building.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_309330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309330/#Comment_309330" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T10:35:09+00:00" title="January 24, 2011 10:35AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timonkey</cite>To me, a method is a way of doing something, an at a smaller unit than a game.</blockquote>Yes, it is indeed smaller than the game.

I am proposing this as a <i>theoretical apparatus</i>.<br/><br/>In <i>praxis</i> we have to recognize each and every game as a unique whole, and apply these terms only to the degree they fit the game, or as reference-points by which we understand and talk about the game. Any term for describing a phenomenon as complex as a single role-playing game, or as diversified as the form role-playing games, must be recognized as a tool, nothing more. What I give you here is a set of tools that may help you contemplate role-playing games in constructive ways. It has certainly helped me.<br/><br/>Having techniques/mechanics affecting setting-elements is not a problem. They are meant to do so, in the interaction. As players we apply the method to the setting (in most games; some of them is about creating the setting too), in order to create the fiction! The method informs us how to do this, and the setting inspires the content of our fiction. <br/><br/>Some techniques are meant to feed right into the fiction too, as mood-tools. The way we talk at the table, the use of rituals and ceremony, touch and silences, stares and gestures ... all these, and more, are meant to strengthen the fiction by adding some sort of mood/emotion/tension. So the fiction becomes more than a narrative; it is emotions, internal group-dynamics, and a weave of real and imagined relations criss-crossing the table. These layers of the fiction may be hard to perceive, but they are almost always present, and may lend enormous strength to the fiction.<br/><br/>If we progress further along this line of thought, it becomes increasingly clear that the fiction of a role-playing game may be perceived to be as complex as life itself, even though it is an artificially created phenomenon. By being created in fleeting layers of social relations and mutual sensory-stimulation, the fiction mimics nature. The fiction may lend credibility from nature, by being close to it in comparison, but it is still <i>a game we play</i>.<br/><br/>To know it is a game, and still being able to immerse ourselves in the experience, creating a fiction of great power, is at the heart of role-playing games to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer" title="Per_Fischer"><img alt="Per_Fischer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/nKW2CLK56GO7V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Per_Fischer">Per_Fischer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309373/#Comment_309373" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T14:50:12+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  2:50PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2011 2:51PM by Per_Fischer.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><br/><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>Most people use "fiction" to mean only the results within the fictional narrative (i.e. what happens to the characters and the world).</blockquote>I use it to mean what happen within the fictional narrative, as perceived by the players.<br/>I do not see how you can read my definition of it as if parts of the interaction is included, but I will try to rephrase:<br/><i>Fiction = the narrative each and every player partake in, and take with him from the game.

The theoretical apparatus of RPGs is not something that should be taken as singular. Very, very coarsely, as you want to apply theory to improving your play and design of RPGs, you should be passing through three phases:<br/><br/>1) learning a theory (or theoretical apparatus), including its limitations and valid domains of application.<br/><br/>2) learning multiple theories and the framework around them so you can handle both the complementary and <i>contradictory</i> explanations of those theories.<br/><br/>3) learning the craft of building new theory frameworks when you require the additional detail or are in a domain that requires it. <br/><br/>Ultimately a theory is just a codification of insights, concepts, and ideas into condensed form - it compresses knowledge into something we can more easily apply and understand, in exchange for sometimes being wrong or ill-suited to the current situation. <br/><br/>Personally I believe there is a wealth of useful RPG theory to be found, and I use it regularly, switching from theory to theory on different problems. But I rarely use the Forge theory you seem to consider as "the theoretical apparatus of roleplaying games". And, yes, one of the reasons is that it doesn't handle non-mechanical elements of play particularly well. But I don't see the point of trying to make the Forge theory work on everything, it does seem to serve particular design and therapeutic purposes very well. Because, we shouldn't expect any theory to work well for all applications. <br/><br/>My suggestion with what you are trying to do is focus on capturing and communicating your particular insights and codify them into a self-contained theoretical structure. Reference other theory as you need, but don't attempt to retain the unnecessary bulk. <br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309377/#Comment_309377" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T15:30:03+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  3:30PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><b>John</b>: your lecture on the origins, re-definement, and discourse surrounding "system" is much appreciated.

I want to note that I advised Ron against supporting that definition of the term back then, on the sole basis that the term was full of mis-directed connotations. He disagreed, and was in his full right to do so. I believe that as a result the discourse on "system matters" went over the head of most traditional players, and made mutual insights harder to come by.

It resulted in both muddled thinking and muddled communication on his part.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>Most people use "fiction" to mean only the results within the fictional narrative (i.e. what happens to the characters and the world).</blockquote>I use it to mean what happen within the fictional narrative, as perceived by the players.<br/>I do not see how you can read my definition of it as if parts of the interaction is included, but I will try to rephrase:<br/><i>Fiction = the narrative each and every player partake in, and take with him from the game.

OK, now I mostly agree with the first part, but I don't agree that the fiction is the "<i>aim of it all</i>".  A game has both fictional narrative and meta-game narrative.

While a game may aim only at creating fiction - for most, the aim is the whole of the experience, not just the fiction.  <br/><br/>I might want to start a new thread on this, but I'd want to check on whether we disagree first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309402/#Comment_309402" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T17:51:42+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  5:51PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2011 11:12AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Mendel.

Back in the 1990s it felt like the great and diverse field of storytelling and dialogue was completely ignored by key figures in the rpg-discourse. To me is was flabbergasting!<br/><br/>So I would indeed like to discuss techniques, and how to find the right balance of mechanics and techniques in any method under construction. There is a whole field of rpg-design out there mislabeled "GM-techniques", by the sole reason that most rpg-designers have failed to really explore them as tools of their trade.<br/><br/>There has been a development, in spite of this, but I would sincerely like to see terms in use, that made it obvious that this is part of any role-playing game a designer is building.<br/><br/>Well, I'm not entirely sure I'm thinking exactly the way you are Tomas, but I'm decidely interested in the concept of putting techniques more centrally in design.<br/><br/>Let me throw something out here as an example and see if it has relevence to this discussion.<br/><br/>Over in this thread<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13665&amp;page=1#Item_20" rel="nofollow">A good hack-n-slash game for 2-6-year-olds?</a>by Matthjis, there was this exhange between Jason Morrningstar and myself:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Do you need rules for that, Matthijs? I played with my nephew when he was that age and it went like this:<br/><br/>Setup a situation related to Star Wars and ask how he wants to address it.<br/>Provide an interesting choice.<br/>Make him roll for success whenever he tries something! We have one six sided die, I arbitrarily set the target number based on circumstances. Eventually he started setting his own target numbers, which was cool.<br/>Provide another interesting choice.<br/>Fight Darth Vader.</blockquote>\nUm, those actually are rules right there JM.<br/><br/>If you take the part about setting target numbers and replace it with "competing rolls with preroll outcome setting" you get very much the sort of games I played with my daughter at a young age.<br/><br/>As for hack'n'slashiness, that's mostly just context. I mean, I had a bunch of monster minis I used with my daughter, and we still mostly ended up with tween drama type games rather than hack'n'slashiness which is what I'd been expecting a bit more often.<br/><br/>So, okay, if I understand your term usage correctly, when Jason says "rules" you'd say <i>mechanics</i>. Where I say "rules", <i>techniques</i> might be a more appropriate word by your formulation. <br/><br/>In either case, it looks like an example of where there is a recognition that some sort of process is important, and that process is repeatable, but the parts of that process don't add up to what you call <i>mechanics</i>. They're something else; your <i>techniques</i>. However, at some level, we're both talking about your <i>game-method</i>, just different parts of it, both using the word "rules".<br/><br/>Okay, good, but what about my early D&amp;D comment?<br/>Allow me to posit two, among many early formulations of D&amp;D play. Both are using the same <i>mechanics</i>. These mechanics imply things about techniques, but the actual techniques useful to each type of play differ.<br/><br/>Type C: In this type, D&amp;D is played in the social context of a largish pool of players, probably members of a college age (average) gaming club. Let us say the pool of players is 20-30. A different line up of players appear at any given session, ranging from 3-12 non-DM players. Multiple sessions will be played, but supposedly the goal is for the gaming sessions to lead and tie-in eventually to a more traditional tabletop miniatures battle game ( or series of games). The stated goal is to end up as the Big Warlord ( or at least in the Big Winning Warlord's Coalition). However, in the tradition of Weseley's Braunstein/ Banana Republic Braunstein and Diplomacy, clever individual gameplay that skirts outside of mechanics might end up being rewarded with a win or partial win or a public social recognition win.<br/><br/>Type K: In this type, D&amp;D is played in a slighty younger age group, say tweens to young teens, possibly early college age. Further, the pool of players is generally smaller (3-8) and more consistent between sessions. This is more about power fantasy and woo-haa! adventures. The goal here is to build up the characters and team, mostly so even cooler and bigger and more involved fights can occur, or extra-mechanical cleverness can be demonstrated to and appreciated by fellow members of the consistent play group.<br/><br/>Soooo...<br/>In both cases, the mechanics might well be the same, but the supporting techniques might vary wildly ( or at a couple of key points that are immediately notable). And I also recognize that I've used very simplistic and limited type examples above to illustrate my point.<br/><br/>The point of my curiosity though, is what things could look like if the techniques for each were illuminated by a spotlight first or centrally, a bit like in Jason M's example that I quoted above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309423/#Comment_309423" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T21:56:59+00:00" title="January 24, 2011  9:56PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recognize your thoughts.  I had similar ideas two years ago when I started reading games for my blog.  I am using a division into rules/setting/form instead.  Looks like we're just using different words for the same things.  Also, your Technique/my Form; I have seen it being called Convention too.<br/>\n<blockquote><a href="http://wilper.wordpress.com/reading-games/" rel="nofollow">Reading games</a><br/><br/><b>What makes a game?</b><br/><br/>I believe that a game as read from a book consists of three parts.<br/><br/><br/>The setting \u2013 The fictional world in which the game is set.<br/>The rules \u2013 The mechanical stuff, dice and tables.<br/>The form \u2013 The way the game is supposed to be played.<br/><br/><br/>For most gamers the first two ones should be pretty obvious. \u2018A game consists of two parts, the rules and the setting.\u2019 But I think that is not enough to describe a game, perhaps it once was, when games actually just had a setting (a dungeon beneath the city) and rules (how to bash the monsters down there and take their gold), it was implied that you\u2019d play a party of adventurers that went down dungeons to bash monsters and loot. These days games are played in so many different ways, just take the GM for example. Once the natural hub of any gaming group, the provider of adventure and fun. In some \u2018new\u2019 games there is no GM, or the role of GM rotates amongst the players during play.<br/><br/><i>Gamer A: \u2018I don\u2019t like Game X.\u2019</i><br/><br/><i>Gamer B: \u2018I love Game X. You\u2019re playing it wrong!\u2019<br/></i><br/>Provided that the preferences of A and B are similar, why did they have so different opinions about Game X? They played the same game, with the same rules and the same setting. The answer lies in the form. The mysterious set of implied conventions of how a game should be played. Some games make the form very clear, some ignore it entirely and you have to guess from reading the rules and the setting. How did the author play this game? How should it be played? How often should the ninjas attack? Should the characters feel angst after bashing the ninjas? Who decided that ninjas should attack; you, I, the GM, all of us together?<br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_309426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309426/#Comment_309426" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-24T22:29:05+00:00" title="January 24, 2011 10:29PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2011 10:43PM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Per Fischer</cite>It's not "the narrative" either - the narrative could be something I narrated after the game</blockquote>I'm solely focused on what a game is, how we play it and what we comes away with.

I do not see how that has relevance.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>I don't agree that the fiction is the "<i>aim of it all</i>".

The fiction is indeed the aim of "it all" (read that as "the game", if you like). People may have other goals in their gaming (getting laid, meeting friends, etc.), but that is outside the realm of the game, as such.<br/><br/>Please explain your "meta-game narrative", and how it may be said to be an aim of <i>the game</i>. I do realize that a designer want his game to be played in specific ways, and that may be a design-goal for him. Playing the game in a specific way is still not the aim of the game. The game is always directed towards the fiction;<br/>- How do we produce it?<br/>- What will it be?<br/>- How will it engage us?<br/>It is important to your understanding of role-playing games, jhkim, that you realize the fact that such games are really <i>aimed at the fiction</i>. There is no way around this. As an arrow seeks out its target, an rpg seeks out its fiction. It may miss, but that is besides the point. (lol)<br/><br/>Of course; we have to be open to the possibility that someone may want to design a game of purpose beyond the fiction. Say: you may want to design a game that gets all the players laid, for real. Someone would surely play it ... ;-)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>I'm not entirely sure I'm thinking exactly the way you are Tomas, but I'm decidely interested in the concept of putting techniques more centrally in design.</blockquote>W-w-what? "Not thinking like me"??? Inconceivable!!! LOL<br/><br/>Good for you; to be interested in storytelling- and dialogue-techniques. The techniques by which we play our games should be interesting to anyone playing them, or at least; to anyone <i>designing</i> them.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>when Jason says "rules" you'd say<i>mechanics</i>. Where I say "rules",<i>techniques</i>might be a more appropriate word by your formulation.</blockquote>Maybe ... I do not care much for translating my terms. I am more into explaining them in their own rights. They do not cover the same ground as other terms, in my experience. The field of role-playing are divided into different terms in different theories, and this is true for this one to. But my apparatus is less of a theory, and more of a working tool for a designer (me). I am not very interesting in developing it into a detailed and set theory. I have found that detail is better improvised in relation to specific questions or games, and that my apparatus is best left in the simple state it is. It constitutes a anchorage for my thoughts and talks, so to say, and an anchorage to my design work.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>In both cases, the mechanics might well be the same, but the supporting techniques might vary wildly</blockquote>Yes. There are multitudes of ways any given role-playing game can be played, or at least; any given <i>classical</i> game can be played. The GM-fiat is strong, and so is the fiat of the players. they will influence the games they are playing. But they still need informed and pointed guidance to their interaction; to be made aware of effective tools and exciting possibilities.<br/><br/>My point is not to support any specific way of playing, but to open up the field of understanding for designers, enabling them to make better games of any types.<br/><br/>My own appliance of this apparatus has enabled me to strengthen my own classical fantasy game <i>Fabula</i>. But it is still a game aimed at producing different kinds of fiction, as most classical games. What I have found, is ways to strengthen game-play, by giving my players a far better method. Part of this is connecting the method to the setting in better ways than before (using both mechanics and techniques), and to work on the setting too, to make it even more inspiring for free-floating game-play. Some of the tools I serve up in my game now, is indeed very specific, and aimed at creating very specific game-play. I intend for my players to make use of these tools too, and to have a better game for it.<br/><br/>I've also applied this apparatus to my modern games, and have come out stronger for it. I find it a very conductive way of thinking role-playing games, in general.<br/><br/><i>Thanks for engaging in this rambling thread!

Group contract was defined as "<i>The set of conventions the players and GM agree on:  including rule system, but also issues like "The GM will fudge things so PCs won't die pointless deaths", or "Pulp genre conventions take precedence over common sense", or even "Don't let the cat in while we play: she bites legs."</i>  I'd note that "techniques" has a different connotation from "conventions" - and they might not apply to the same things.  <br/><br/>Are there things that are conventions but not techniques, and vice-versa?

LOL<br/><br/>Players come to the table with varying agendas. They may be completely blank on the game, but looking forward to a night with their friends. They may be totally in the know on the game, but still looking forward to a night with their friends. They may be seriously engaged in the game itself, and with less sympathy for chitter-chatter and other social derailments. Most of them have mixed agendas; friends, playing something, challenging themselves, experiencing a gripping tale ...<br/><br/>Whatever agendas the players bring to the table, the challenge for the gamesmith, through his game, is to get them on the same page, and have them discover the true magic of his game.<br/><br/>If your game is any good, it will convince the players it is worth engaging in, and it will deliver them the tools they need to work the magic themselves. And then the players are left to decide; will they set aside their various agendas, and accept the game as their purpose for the evening? That is the great question for any designer, because his game rise or falls with the answer to that question. And the fact is, that <i>one player alone</i> can ruin the chance for a game to shine. If one player insist on ignoring the interaction, to chat with his friend over the table, the game may be lost. Games are not equally vulnerable to this kind of conflicting agendas, but most games that want to work the magic is. There is no magic without the synthesis of game and players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309523/#Comment_309523" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-25T10:46:51+00:00" title="January 25, 2011 10:46AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wilhelm</cite><cite>Posted By: timonkey</cite><br/>In Mouse Guard, one of the players recaps the previous session.

I had similar ideas two years ago when I started reading games for my blog.  I am using a division into rules/setting/form instead.  Looks like we're just using different words for the same things.  Also, your Technique/my Form; I have seen it being called Convention too.</blockquote>I would rather say "your Form/my Method", but my term still has a different meaning (and other qualities as well, look below).<br/><br/>We have similar ideas, yes, but we're not "just using different words". The  reason I have made my nomenclature is that I have found a lot of rpg-terms in popular use to be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inherently unfit</span> for the use their intended, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">largely misinterpreted</span> and often so <span style="text-decoration: underline;">clotted with connotations</span> that their functionality as communicative and intellectual tools are severely reduced. In some ways terms like "system" is indeed a stumbling block to further developments. So my set of terms is designed to un-clutter the field, first and foremost for myself. I present it to you as a gift, to be used or thrown away (much as other gifts). But it is <i>a full set</i>, with terms meant to work together, to support a broader understanding and clearer thinking on role-playing games. If you make use of it, I am sure it will help your ponderings on rpgs.<br/><br/><i>Techniques</i> have mainly been left to convention, yes. There's been little research done by game-smiths, and little engineering done, on tools of techniques. In classical games of old the advice has been rather vague, so there's been a void here (in some cases quite fruitful, but more often not so) that various GMs have had to fill in, thus creating the convention. Games of the new millennium, both classical and modern ones, are generally a bit better. Some of them are quite good. But still; this is a field largely un-explored, and I believe that is our next frontier!<br/><br/>Mind you: I do not propose that game designers of old were bad designer. They were pioneers in a new form of expression! In my view the classical role-playing game <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> range alongside the early drama <i>Antigone</i>, the early novel <i>Don Quixote</i> and the early full lenght feature-movie <i>Birth of A Nation</i>, as a groundbreaking work in its field. <br/><br/>And I do not say that designers of today could have done better. We <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> doing better, exploring and inventing our form of expression with each and every new game.<br/><br/>My idea is to contribute to the development of role-playing games of the future, by helping out in understanding the potential, and by pointing out particular fields of exploration I consider to be worth focusing on.<br/><br/>From Wilhelms blog:<blockquote><b>What makes a game?</b><br/><br/>I believe that a game as read from a book consists of three parts.<br/><br/><br/>The setting \u2013 The fictional world in which the game is set.<br/>The rules \u2013 The mechanical stuff, dice and tables.<br/>The form \u2013 The way the game is supposed to be played.<br/> </blockquote>You are, of course, on to much the same picture I'm trying to paint here. I see that you put emphasis on the way the game is supposed to be played, and that is good!<br/><br/>I see you explains <b>the setting</b> with "the fictional world". The meaning of that is quite clear, and in liege with popular use of the word. Still: to me there is inherent danger in using it like that. Both players and designers have a tendency to think of the setting as something their characters "live in". I hold this perception to be untrue. As I see it <i>the setting</i> is created by the designer, as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a set of tools</span> used to inspire the fiction. And <i>the fiction</i> is created by the players, as they play the game,  using said setting-tools (amongst others). The characters comes alive in the fiction, as does the "world" they live in. The setting has no life, no movable parts; it's a set of tools, to be used alongside the methodic tools to create a movable and dynamic fiction. That's why I use <i>the fiction</i> as a central element of itself in my nomenclature. I am vary of the popular use of it. <br/><br/>I'm not particularly fond of the term "<b>rules</b>". It functions very well in boardgames, were the procedures are set. In role-playing games the term is slightly off, in my opinion. I cannot (or care not) serve any thorough argumentation for this, so lets just leave it at that.<br/><br/>As for the term "<b>form</b>"; I do not like it. For one: the term could be misinterpreted to point towards the art-form. But mostly my dislike is due to the term indicating something stagnant, non-dynamic. I very much prefer the term <i>method</i>, as it carries the definition of "how we do it" in itself, and thus is indicative of something movable and dynamic.<br/><br/><i>I thank you all for contributing to this thread!
