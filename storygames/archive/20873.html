I'm asking because it's got its own answers to all of your questions figured out, so it's sort of the obvious place to look first. The basic premise of magic items in that game is that knowing an item's history is tantamount to mastering the item's magic, so characters are naturally motivated to know more about their gear.<br/><br/>I think (without having any particular sources, just speculating here) that the simple reason for why 4th edition went this way was that they wanted to get rid of the traditional subgame of "guess my magic powers". It involved identifying that an item is magical, hauling it to a sage, having Identify spells cast on it, and so on - a laborious process with no guarantees that adventurers ever find and figure out their items. An idea like attunement conveniently replaces this old-fashioned complication with a straightforward system that guarantees that characters can actually equip and use the gear they find. They could have gone with dirt-cheap and 100% reliable identification magic scrolls like some video games do (and like they did with light sources for dungeoneering), but apparently it would've been a step too far to simply ignore the issue altogether and straight out assume that magic items are automatically usable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458202/#Comment_458202" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-19T16:44:52+00:00" title="November 19, 2016  4:44PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It <i>is</i> handwavy, I agree. This does match the preferences of most D&amp;D groups I've been a part of, though. With magic items being an (assumed and expected) reward, this is just a reasonable simplification of the AD&amp;D/3E way of having a wizard cast Identify during downtime, which, after the 3rd time, just turned into  a chore and counting pennies - making magic even more into something utilitarian and dull.<br/>The only alternative approach that I know of is the hardcore old-school one where you have to discover an item's properties by experimenting with it, with potentially dangerous and sometimes deadly consequences - also depending on how devious the DM's item design is. Even without adding cursed items to the recipe, this approach turns learning an item's properties into an adventure of its own, but it's only reasonable to expend this much efforts if magic items in your game <i>are</i> game-changing.<br/>Where magic items are commonplace enough to be an expected and even assumed component of PC effectiveness, as it was in medium to high level 3E and 4E, then something as harmless and handwavy as those "attunement" rules looks like the only reasonable way to go.<br/><br/>IMO, the problem with magic items in (most flavors of) D&amp;D is that 9/10 of them are totally boring. I'm not sure making it harder or more time-consuming to learn how they work is a viable way to make them more interesting, per se. The point is, in my opinion, that magic items themselves need be made interesting. Adding backstory to each one looks like a reasonable way to mitigate that "run of the mill +1 sword" feeling a lot of D&amp;D games have, and using attunement as the excuse to reveal such backstory to players sounds reasonable, but I agree it isn't enough. If you're going this way, prepping a piece of backstory for each item, maybe you could try to make that story relevant to the current adventure and general campaign backstory, in such ways that meditating over found items becomes a mean to progress in the adventure - use this time to drop hints to the solution of enigmas, reveal secret passages and stuff. But that's a lot of work, and yet not warranted to <i>make magic items interesting</i>... I'd also try and tie the item's history to its powers above and beyond the regular rules, creating rarely useful side-powers and such. Vincent Baker's <i>The Seclusium of Orphone</i> has some interesting stuff in it about this topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JohnnFour" title="JohnnFour"><img alt="JohnnFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JohnnFour">JohnnFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458203/#Comment_458203" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-19T16:47:33+00:00" title="November 19, 2016  4:47PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Earthdawn.

Is it about their history/background? Is it about their personality? Is it about how much control the PC has over their powers?<br/><br/>Figure out what it is that you want to dig into when it comes to magical items. (Those three things above are just suggestions.)<br/><br/>Let's say it's "interesting history".<br/><br/>OK, great! Knowing an item's history is an advantage to the character.<br/><br/>Sample rule:<br/><br/>1. You can "attune" yourself to an item by spending some time with it. This requires some kind of small ritual, and thereafter allows you to use the item.<br/><br/>* There is a "standard" ritual all adventurers learn which can do this. (Alternatively, different classes might know different rituals, explaining why some characters can use one type of item while others can't!)<br/><br/>* When you conduct the ritual, you roll some dice. In a worst-case scenario, you learn what the item is and how to use it, but a better roll carries more beneficial results (e.g. unlocking an additional ability, more charges to spend, more power/effect, better control of side effects).<br/><br/>[It might be better for it to be a reliable process than a roll, perhaps. Adjust to taste!]<br/><br/>* You can get a bonus for tying elements of the item's history into the ritual. For instance, if you find out that the magical weapon you're holding was used in a great war against invading Orcs, then involving Orcs somehow in the ritual gives you a bonus to this roll.<br/><br/>If you like it to be complicated, that could mean actually finding some specific items or material components and burning them during the attuning ritual. If you want it to be simple and quick, just have the player declare their characters adds some words about "Orcs, hated enemies" into the ritual. Either way, though, it requires the characters learning about the item first.<br/><br/>Either way, you now have an incentive to learn about items, and you can use that to create "plot hooks" or tie them into your adventures.<br/><br/>For example, let's say the PCs have a magical sword of great power, and they know it was involved in the Great Orc Wars. They'd like to attune the Fighter with the sword, but they have a feeling it might have greater powers they'd miss out on if they didn't learn about it first.<br/><br/>They beat up and capture a group of Orcs. Now they have an interest in these Orcs! <br/><br/>-"Was anyone here a veteran of the Great Orc Wars, they ask?"<br/><br/>-"No, but our leader, back at our camp, served in the Wars."<br/><br/>The players decide that this Orc chieftain might have important information about the sword they could use during their attunement, so they now have the option to seek him out, instead of using the sword at its "base effectiveness", if they find that interesting.<br/><br/>Instead of the item's history, it could be about the character's relationship to the item (I like the idea of it being a Reaction Roll, which determines something about how the character and the item will interact in the future - perhaps a friendly spirit inside the weapon would give advice occasionally and answer questions, whereas an unfriendly one just stay silent or makes strange and ominous proclamations). Or it could be about understanding its uses better (learning about it teaches you a trick for how to control its effects, or maybe you have to learn about its powers first before you can use them at all).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry" title="Jonas Ferry"><img alt="Jonas Ferry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonas%20Ferry">Jonas Ferry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458237/#Comment_458237" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-21T20:53:20+00:00" title="November 21, 2016  8:53PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><strong>First question, does anyone know the design thinking behind this mechanic? Any designer blogs on it from WotC or elsewhere?</strong></blockquote>\nI play Whitehack, an old-school D&amp;D offspring, which has an attunement system, but not for magic items. One of the classes, the Deft, can attune themselves to objects or living things and use them to perform supernatural feats, think Robin Hood with his bow. The rules on identifying magic in weapons are merely suggestions in Whitehack, but what we do is require a skill roll to figure out if an object is magical, an identification spell to reveal bound spells and their activation words, and then the PC has to spend 12 hours meditating and training with the object to attune themselves. This means that only they can use the weapon, and if the PC dies, the weapon is destroyed. This means that you can't have level 1 PCs that are not afraid to die because they know their next PC gets the +3 sword again. (There's a minor issue here, since this means magic items could never be recovered from slain NPCs, but I've decided to ignore this issue.)<br/><br/>The attunement was introduced to prevent instant weapon upgrades during adventures, and the hand-me-down effect of other weapons. If the fighter has a +2 sword, the thief a +1 sword, the wizard a +0 sword, and they find a +3 sword, they can't just immediately bump their numbers up one step, as this would feel cheap. Also, if the fighter dies with their +2 sword there's no debate whether the thief gets it or the fighter's player's next PC.<br/><br/>I haven't seen, or looked for, any official reasoning from D&amp;D designers on this issue, but it seems like a trade-off between usability of new magic items and having to expend some effort to use them.\n<blockquote><strong>Second, my players like the mechanic, so I'm keeping it. But I'd like to tweak it and am looking for ideas. How to enhance gameplay with magic item attunement?</strong></blockquote>\nI recently read the 13th Age SRD (available <a href="http://www.13thagesrd.com/" rel="nofollow">online</a>) to mine for ideas for abstract combat ranges and stumbled upon their system for <a href="http://www.13thagesrd.com/magic-items/" rel="nofollow">magic items</a>. Skip past the one-use items and read up on True Magic Items, Chakras, and the Magic Item Descriptions. Basically you can attune a number of magic items per PC, but each item has its own personality that bleeds over to the PC. If you attune more items than you can handle, the personality effect is amplified. There are no hard and fast rules for this, but I think it sounds like a wonderful way of introducing the item's backstory into play if it affects the PC's choices in some big or small way. Attuning a really nasty item would give you that +2, but now you have a hard time trusting other people, or whatever the effect is. I will borrow that for my Whitehack game.<br/><br/>Perhaps the personality effect can be discovered through finding out about the item's history, which would be smart to do before you attune yourself? If everyone who carried the sword died alone without friends, perhaps you should think twice before attuning yourself?
