Granted, we chewed the scenery so much that we kept a running tally of truly salient quotes ("The concerns of lesser men are as but feathers to their superiors", f'rinstance), but yeah - totally weirdly, characterization and all that were a big part of play, but only sort of supported by the game mechanics. Granted, <i>Storming</i> just drips Color, and pushes GMs to design settings that are full of the stuff, but strictly speaking, that's a sort of secondary agenda or something. <br/>b) I can have fun with Gamist games - as somebody who had always thought that only something like <i>Donjon</i> could be sufficiently co-creative to make me happy Stepping On Up, I was really surprised to see a well-executed, fun, colorful Gamist game take place, with me a part of it! That's not to say there aren't tweaks and suggestions I'd make (poor wizards!), but the core mechanic was really solid (and not just 'cause I, a warrior, threw double handfuls of dice all the time ^_^)<br/>c) It's likely one may have no idea how a game is going to "look" until you've sat through a sufficient period of play. The phenomenon of "the game text feels unfinished" seems to be a pretty sweet thing to have, actually, as it shows a certain elegance, perhaps (or just bad editing, if it's <i>Hero Wars</i> ^_^) in the rules. <br/><br/>- playtesting my game <i>La Familia</i> (click <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=28997.msg271270#new" rel="nofollow">here</a> for rules), I learned that it's possible for my design to support short-play (3.5 hours, all told), and smaller groups (3 people), but this seems to almost automatically push aside certain parts of play. Only one protagonist's Grudges saw any screen time, some implied non-tagonists never got so much as a cameo (the Bishop of Milan, for one), and Clan Treasures, those grand and mighty assets of the major families, only saw screen time as props, not actually useful devices. <br/>I was extremely pleased that the core mechanic worked as beautifully as I could have hoped - it was both a group experience, and a meaningful one, to come up with Complications for each conflict roll, and said Complications drove play in new directions, fueled by communal creativity, as I'd hoped. Shyeah! <br/>It occurs to me that Pips (each Pip lets you modify one die result by one, up or down) may actually be redundant, or at least need to be more carefully used - we've all probably seen the ugliness that comes from a tiny pool of character traits, when one or two traits are suddenly useful for bloody <i>everything</i>. I'm looking at Buddha's use of his "Scheming" trait, although it might've been Joe's, actually. Anyway, since Clan Treasures grant Pips, but they are very story-ful and can be taken away, it occurs to me that they really need to overshadow trait-Pips, so as to keep the pot stirring. Again, I'd have to actually run a game that included Clan Treasures more in order to be certain. <br/>So - a multi-session storyline, more people at once, etc., will be what I look for next. With any luck, I can drum up some interest at the Strat AND break the Curse of the One-Shot, at least for a little bit.<br/><br/>And... go!<br/>[Edited for writing-fail]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242376/#Comment_242376" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-17T09:02:22+00:00" title="November 17, 2009  9:02AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2009 9:03AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I learned that my game Cowboys With Big Hearts mostly works, and I learned what needs fixing.

Raimond was my protagonist, and I wasn't really sure what to do with him for the first half of the game or so.  This often happens when I play characters with high levels of political/social power who don't really want to leave their throne room, and in games without in-your-face opposition.  So, after the game at Nerdly, I asked Dan what Raimond's player did with their scenes, especially in the early game.  "Well, mostly Raimond indulged his worst instincts and made a lot of trouble for himself and everyone else."  So obvious, and yet, not really something I'd considered.  In games with a tragic bent like Montsegur, I tend to treat my characters as charges for me to guide and protect as best as I can through the disasters to come.  Next time, however, if I'm not sure what to do I'll try having my character massively screw up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242544/#Comment_242544" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T07:11:37+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  7:11AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ignotus</cite>if I'm not sure what to do I'll try having my character massively screw up.</blockquote>\nThis is a great lesson learned!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242549/#Comment_242549" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T07:23:33+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  7:23AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhosmer1</cite><br/>...that I have a Geek Cave to be proud of.<br/></blockquote>\nBoy howdy!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242553/#Comment_242553" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T07:53:14+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  7:53AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Thanks, Dray!</blockquote>\nYou're welcome.

In absence of knowledge of her exact age, I played her as a 6-year-old. She told people when they were mean and hid in dark places to stay safe. I still don't get what people saw that was creepy, except perhaps that folks were bringing in memories of prior games and projecting onto my portrayal of Faye.
