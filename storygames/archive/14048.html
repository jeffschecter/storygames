For Burning Wheel, many of the artha awards are based on peer review.  The "Embodiment" award, for example, is awarded by the Game master to some of the players for your personal judgment that they did excellent role playing..  The "Most Valuable Player" or the "Workhorse" award are other examples of a more general peer review, where the group of players votes for someone. Making a judgment like this regarding my friends around the table makes me uncomfortable.<br/><br/>For White Wolf and Shadowrun, there are similar arbitrary "Good Roleplaying" awards, however these are entirely in the hands of the Storyteller.  Again, this metric of judging other players on how well they role played makes me uncomfortable. My social groups do not favor peer review, and I typically automatically hand out the Roleplaying award to everyone to avoid hurt feelings. I also really don't think that I have any place to judge my friends in this particular way.<br/><br/>After playing games that move away from this, and I'm specifically thinking of Apocalypse World and The Shadow of Yesterday, I found that I really enjoyed the lack of peer review, the absence of these systems that ask the other players to judge your play.<br/><br/>So to kick things off, I really like the advancement in Apocalypse World. There are no peers looking to judge your progress. There are only two instances where the Players and Master of Ceremonies are involved with the advancement.  The first is with choosing a highlighted stat at the beginning of the session, and the second is with History at the end of the session.  The highlighted stat is done at the beginning of the game, and so it places no judgment on what you'll do during the actual session, it just indicates where the rewards can be collected. It encourages behavior, but again, the player's methods are not being scrutinized.   The History at the end of the session is simply an observation of the events, and when it changes it also places no judgment on whether the actions taken were "good roleplaying" or not, simply the effects they had on the people involved.  History can award points whether it's very high or very low, so again, no punishment for the methods taken.<br/><br/>Key based advancement are another thing I really like, from the Shadow of Yesterday.  The Keys place advancement square in the hands of the player. If they do this thing, they get experience.  If they don't, then they don't get experience.  The focus is on the player to award themselves for activities they undertake, and the other players are not involved in that decision making.  For example, the Key of Bloodlust is very straightforward. you get a reward for defeating someone in battle.  You get a little more reward if their skill was the same or higher than yours.  If they do these things, the player is rewarded. <br/><br/>So with this in mind, how can I take the existing experience point systems in these other games that I otherwise enjoy playing, and change how Experience points are awarded?   <br/><br/>For example in White Wolf Storyteller Games, would it be possible to highlight a pair of attributes? A great deal of the rolls are usually Attribute + Skill, so that might work. If a character rolls their Wits + whatever, they get a little mark.  If they get enough marks, they get an experience point. You adjust the number of marks to reflect what kind of advancement rate works for the group.<br/><br/>How about Keys in the Storyteller system? What are the pluses and minuses of using keys in this system?  Would it work?  <br/><br/>Now, keep in mind that my gaming group preference might not be your gaming group preference.  I really don't want this discussion to be about whether or not Peer Reviewing your friends in a role playing game is a good or a bad thing, I want to explore alternatives found in other game systems, and examine how these concepts can be used for games like D&amp;D, White Wolf Storyteller systems, Burning Wheel, or Shadowrun.  <br/><br/>Ideas and commentary on the pluses and minuses of using these different reward techniques, as well as some thoughts on other techniques that could be used (I'm only referencing the two that I think would be intriguing) would be most welcome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318061/#Comment_318061" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-29T10:30:22+00:00" title="March 29, 2011 10:30AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great topic! I remember cringing when I read about that suggestion in Wild Talents. There's a lot of potential for problems with it.<br/><br/>The current thing I really like are FATE Points/Hero Points. FATE 3.0 systems, as well as M&amp;M3e (and more systems likely), have a system of rewarding with X Points if some characteristic works against you. Your lover is in danger and you have to save hir? Have a point! Your unquenchable honesty gets you into trouble? Have a point! Your wings catch fire walking past a sconce with a torch in it? Have a point!<br/><br/>It doesn't sound nearly as good the way I presented it, but that idea of having some sort of reward based on a complication that really has something to do with your character is a great way of handing out points. Now it's not exactly experience, but in that aspect you don't necessarily need to advance, only to change. FATE shuffles around your skills, I think in M&amp;M you don't necessarily advance at all, so having a reward being intermittent ability to be better or to do something out of the ordinary is pretty sweet. Getting XP to increase your hit % by 5, when everything you face gets 5% harder to hit ends up feeling hollow, once you realise what's up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318065/#Comment_318065" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-29T11:02:39+00:00" title="March 29, 2011 11:02AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jon Slack</cite>For White Wolf and Shadowrun, there are similar arbitrary "Good Roleplaying" awards, however these are entirely in the hands of the Storyteller.

Basically it's a "you roleplayed!" reward. Kinda seems pointless to me.<br/><br/>Have you seen the Call of Cthulhu advacement system? Essentially a successful skill use means you have a chance to improve that skill at the end of the session.  The chance decreases as you get better and better at the skill.  Might be worth looking into.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318066/#Comment_318066" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-29T11:11:19+00:00" title="March 29, 2011 11:11AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you already have a Keys-like mechanics in Storyteller: Nature and Demeanor. You'd just need to spell it out in a more specific way. <br/><br/>I think highlighting stats instead of rewarding "good roleplay" would work, for various interpretations of "good roleplay". The only disconnect I see is AW has 5 stats, WoD has 9 Attributes. How often do you roll? How many xp are you expected to get per session in WoD? I don't remember. Also, what's stopping a player from rolling that stat just whenever they want? As far as I remember, the Storyteller calls for rolls, yeah? In AW you know exactly when you roll, and there are reasons why you wouldn't roll all the time.<br/><br/>A lot to think about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_318073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318073/#Comment_318073" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-29T11:45:17+00:00" title="March 29, 2011 11:45AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Comment A: Yeah, I feel like these things fall flat a lot because they fail to encourage what it seems like they're trying to encourage. I know in some editions of VtM, RAW, the RP award only goes to one player (the "best" role player). It seems like the point of this is that the players would be motivated to out do each other in the RP department, thus consistently bringing their A-game. Now, I could see this being an effective motivator in theory, but I can honestly say I've never seen it work in practice.<br/><br/>The one case in which RP awards are cool is when, even though its an ST decision, everyone agrees where it should go. When all the players are actually impressed by a given player's performance, and he gets a tangible reward for it, it feels really good for the whole group.<br/><br/>Comment B: Even though I've never played The Shadow of Yesterday, it seems like some of the criteria for fulfilling Keys is pretty abstract. It seems like peer review would be pretty inevitable here. with disagreements cropping up about whether or not a key was fulfilled or not.<br/><br/>Comment C: Other advancement systems could be easily added onto the WW/Storyteller/Storytelling system. I don't know how fundamentally they would change the game, if at all. I always thought a more "simulation" based system would be more effective in keeping character ability both diverse and reasonable, being able to spend your points how you see fit, with the caveat of "ST approval" always seemed kind of cheap. What counts as a valid reason to dump points into Celerity? When is it okay for the ST to say no? Whereas, a use it you get it system would mitigate or eliminate this problem, while it might cause other problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/318076/#Comment_318076" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-29T12:18:03+00:00" title="March 29, 2011 12:18PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What if the system were changed so that the whole group critiqued itself and awarded benefits and penalties accordingly.  For example, the group could identify their best and worst scene and write down a circumstance about them.  If that circumstance comes up in the game again, they get a bonus to their rolls.  So, if the group thought the scene with Benny went well, they'd get a bonus next time they run into him.  If they thought the scene in the cave went badly, then they would detriment next time they did something in the cave.  This way the group moves towards more role playing in circumstances they like/excel at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
