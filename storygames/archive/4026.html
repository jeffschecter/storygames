Mark made Montrose Solomon, the mulatto ex-slave loa-worshiper. Josh made Dr. Harvey Bridges, the reluctant pirate surgeon. Jim made Billybones Pete, inveterate black-hearted boatswain, and eventual captain.<br/><br/>We managed to get through to claiming plunder (from the Resolute. turned from battle no less) and a little bit of leisure ashore, by way of desecrating a lonely Anglican chapel.  <br/><br/>I for one am more and more interested in Poison'd as a game, although the text is deceptively dense, such that only after two separate sessions am I beginning to catch nuances of text that result in reasonably large changes in actual play.  Specifically, that the stages of ship combat are each their own fight, rather than being one long fight.<br/><br/>I'm a little afraid I'm the only one of us as impressed, though.  Hopefully, the rest of the crew will contribute their own thoughts about the game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90081/#Comment_90081" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T07:52:44+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  7:52AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judson,<br/><br/>Can you talk about what you liked about it?<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90101/#Comment_90101" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T09:08:00+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  9:08AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2007 9:09AM by jim pinto.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We absolutely loved Character Creation.

In another thread, Jonathon Walton said he wasn't sure what he was supposed to be doing as GM, which struck me as completely bizarre, since I felt like I knew exactly what I should be doing.  Granted, that was coupled strongly with teaching the game, so it started out with explaining stats and running through creating characters, up a sort of ladder of scale, with each step cascading into something larger, and the initial situation sets the table at the foot of the ladder and gives them a push to start climbing.  <br/><br/>Specifically, the first thing that happens is Tom Reed, who's just poisoned the captain, is dragged onto the deck, cursing everyone and gloating that HMS Resolute is on it's way to sink the Dagger.  Right away you're presented with elections (possibly for Reed's fate, very likely for captain), bargaining and success checks, to brain Reed or the like.   From there, the ladder climbs with cruel fates (mechanical components of situation), to a ship battle as a series of fights, prizes and plunder, to leisure and ambitions, and from there, it seems to me, the whole table knows the game.  The GM has a clear road in terms of bringing in and managing the various cruel fates, and while they're a lot of creative input from the GM, it's rarely numeric, which is a really interesting way to establish a GM's role.<br/><br/>There's a big character cycle in success checks, fights, plunder, and ambition, that throws off a lot of energy into the rest of the game.  <br/><br/>For example, success checks are made by rolling two of your stats against each other, depending on the kind of action (roughly speaking: enduring duress, deceit and stealth, attacking the helpless, risking life and limb), which means that pirates quickly take on a tone of the things they're good at.  Their stats are a count of sins they've committed, injuries they've suffered, ambitions they're pursuing, so changes in stats have clear counterparts to development in fiction - if you just killed a man for the first time, your devil goes up one, and your soul down.  <br/><br/>If that cycle is the engine of the game, then bargains are its transmission.  Any time you make a bargain, it's parts each have a mechanical effect: until its fulfilled the person you owe can withhold dice from any roll you make, and then you can count the bargain fulfilled.  In order to get a useful part of the plunder, or even just get help being captain, you wind up bargaining with PCs and NPCs alike, forming this web of temporary connections across the game.<br/><br/>The core of my like for this game, though, is just how considered and well structured it is.  Tiny things, that seem like they're just convention or commentary wind up contributing in surprising and fascinating ways.  In discussion afterwards, Josh brought up that your sins seemed to be weighted more heavily, since they influence both your devil and soul stats, and hence two kinds of success checks.  First, yes, that makes it more rewarding for pirates to sin (although soul will never return, once it's been reduced).  But, secondly, that coupling is almost required by the way the stats are related to each other by success checks, if stats are going to remain mechanically interesting.  From the surface though, it looks like just the logical relationship between the two stats.<br/><br/>So, there are some of the things I like about it.  If you're going to be at Gateway next weekend, I'll almost certainly have it in my bag, and I'm decidedly looking to do a little unscheduled role playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90163/#Comment_90163" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T12:09:14+00:00" title="August 24, 2007 12:09PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2007 12:27PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, <br/><br/>I'm in your <i>Shock</i> game on Sunday, so, yeah, I'll be there!<br/><br/>Also, I'm running <i>PtA</i>  on Friday @ 3pm, and Sat @ 8pm.<br/><br/>And <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword </i>on Sunday @ 3pm.<br/><br/>All my games are pre-reg'd booked right now, but there will be slots at the con, and I'd love to have you in a game.<br/><br/>My two free slots are the first slots Sat and Sun, though there's a game I'm going to scramble to get into on Sat. @ 3pm that I might not get into, but I'm gonna try.<br/><br/>So, first thing Sat or Sun for horrible, immoral deeds are my best times, or late night.<br/><br/>See you then!<br/><br/>All the <br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90188/#Comment_90188" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T13:10:05+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  1:10PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2007 1:11PM by Josh Roby.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a sweet little game, and packaged in a very deceptive packaging.  In fact, that'd be my primary complaint about the game: it seems best-suited for pretty significant, long-term play.  The book looks like it presents a couple hours' entertainment.  I didn't read the whole book before playing, but afterwards I went through and, while there are tons of very intricate interconnected bits and pieces, those interconnections are not presented in the book.  It's totally a "trust me" product: start playing, and by the end of hour two, you'll be engaged -- but you need to dive in and play, without really knowing what you're going to get engaged <em>to</em>, in order to get there.  Vincent can just barely get away with this; I wouldn't get to hour two with a game written by somebody else.<br/><br/>We also recorded our post-playtest nattering.  The exchange sort of went like this: "We should take notes." "We should get a digital audio recorder."  "Wait, I have my computer in my bag right here."  And then the next day, the moral of the story is: GarageBand is pretty fucking awesome.<br/><br/>You can download the playtest recording at: <a href="http://kallistipress.com/LAGames/LAGames%20082207%20Poison'd.m4a" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://kallistipress.com/LAGames/LAGames 082207 Poison'd.m4a</a><br/><br/>(Andy, why can't I just link to the file?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90189/#Comment_90189" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T13:11:59+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  1:11PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            we had a fun game but the fun was inspired by aspects of character creation as Jim stated (picking from lists of sins and injuries and ambitions etc) and a few chunks of the rules rather than all the interconnecting systems judson mentions<br/><br/>For example, each of us seized upon one or two of our sins and goals and those shaped who we played the characters: Josh's doc was defined by having no sins and wanting to escape the pirate crew and reintegrate into normal society; my character was defined by idolatry and wanting revenge on a bishop; Jim's by sodomy and wanting to be captain. We had some neat scenes that were marginally improved/impacted by some success checks and the striking of a few bargains. Our main use of the fight/escalation system, our flight from, attempt to board and unintended sinking of Resolute, was the most boring part of the game. I liked the glimpse we got of turning plunder into what's essentially shore leave and the ability to pursue one's ambitions<br/><br/>for that reason when we finished play the first reaction of the three players was that the game was unnecessarily complex<br/><br/>upon talking further, learning more about some of the stuff we didn't immediately grasp when we jumped into it, and thinking about how some of the game's features would work over an extended campaign, we started to view the game more positively (but still in need of more play advice in the text as well as possibly some trimming down of systems)<br/><br/>I'm interested in trying it again and in particular seeing how the bargains work in more detail and using the plunder/shore leave currency to achieve goals as a way of structuring play<br/><br/>My main criticism of the game is the fight system for ship to ship and person to person combat, which relies players' choice of escalating to greater levels of violence. It seems like an import from dogs in the vineyard rather than a good fit for this game, at least based on our session where the sins/injuries/ ambitions were what inspired us the most<br/><br/>for dogs it makes sense to present players with the moral choice of escalating; here it seems weird that our scum pirates have to jump through hoops to do terrible things (although there is a rule where you can spend three resources to just kill an npc). Also, why is there a separate detailed system for combat but not for sex, blasphemy, trading/greed etc?<br/><br/>I'd suggest either:<br/><br/>* get rid of fight rules and just use the success rolls<br/>* get rid of fight system add some escalation steps to the four success categories<br/>* add some additional escalation/fight categories for verbal debate, blasphemy, sex, etc.<br/>* give  players the choice of starting at the TOP of the escalation or the bottom, so you could start ultraviolent and then risk descalating                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Piers" title="Piers"><img alt="Piers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Piers">Piers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90227/#Comment_90227" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-24T14:15:50+00:00" title="August 24, 2007  2:15PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark,<br/><br/>I really like the fact that there is no way to deal with other characters except by fighting them.  It brings back the vibe of early D&amp;D in an interesting way, that "in the end the only way is violence" feeling, which I think is an important part of the game's theme.  Bargaining is a stop-gap which holds the society of the pirates together only temporarily, like Hobbes' concept of contract.<br/><br/>As for killing people in fights: the results of escalation are what happen to the participants more or less by accident during the fight.  I'm assuming that afterwards the loser is helpless, and thus can be killed with a Brutality vs. Soul roll--if the pirate can stomach it.  Damage done during the fight importantly avoids this restriction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90362/#Comment_90362" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-25T08:25:59+00:00" title="August 25, 2007  8:25AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua, thank you for that recording!

The design and presentation are. crazy-good  I don't know how it plays, but in terms of laying out clear situations from drama -- both the blunt opening situation and a matrix of variables on the character sheet that constantly offer the chance to create new situations -- this game is -- well, amazing.

I'm running PtA starting at 8pm.  We need cloning technology at this damn'd thing!<br/><br/>Also -- yes... Long form.  I listened the recording of the notes, and I see Josh's point.  The artifact of the rules makes it look like <i>Munchkin</i>.... <br/><br/>But truth to tell, when I read that little introduction that ends with, "This is what happened next..." I was like, "<i>Oh</i>, this is a <i>story</i>.  Like told over five nights at the tavern in a fishing village on a rocky coast where everyone's been in boats for ten generations."<br/><br/>It cries for the starting situation on that boat to rise into growing clarity that is banished by a few twists, unexpected turns, redemption that no one saw coming, and a fall into hell that no one anticipated as the characters move toward their ambitions and situations shift by choice of the other Players and the GM.<br/><br/>Though compact, the rules are, more than anything else to me, a series situation generators running in parallel -- starting with the mutiny on the ship and driving forward with all sorts of layering of problems and revelations.  Vincent seems to have stripped the damned RPG notion to the bone, but, unlike say <i>The Pool</i>, has provided concrete, yet flexible, guidance for moving a story forward with the varied lists and options contained in the booklet.  <br/><br/>Switch around Ambitions, Sins, and so on and you get a different "telling" of the tale at each coastal tavern you visit.<br/><br/>Yeah.
