I can't wait to play but will have to wait until a con or something because my group just won't go for it.

I can't fit in more than one night a week, typically, at the moment, and neither can most of the other folks I game with, so to take up The New Hotness would basically necessitate at least a break from The Olde Hotness.

My problem is that my gaming group tends to map to my close circle of friends.  A few of us are parents, most of us are writers, and it's hard to find the time to socialize with them AND game.  Finding time for a second group is really hard; it's challenging enough to get my primary group together.<br/><br/>Add to this the wrinkle that most of the group is either DnD focused or system-agnostic (i.e., don't care as long as it's not complex), and I'm the only one with a yen to experiment with new systems.  I've dragged them through Trollbabe, Wushu, FATE, Ars Magica, and a little Heroquest.  Most of the players want long-term campaign play, which also makes it tricky to try new games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211951/#Comment_211951" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T10:32:41+00:00" title="June 12, 2009 10:32AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>At least in my experience, the problem's often one of finding time for more gaming. </blockquote>\nThis, times one million.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211952/#Comment_211952" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T10:33:48+00:00" title="June 12, 2009 10:33AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I did that at one time, Judd, and now both groups are friends, and cross-breeding.</blockquote>\nUs too.

The characters were an eccentric scientist at the University performing experiments on himself (cf. William Hurt in "Altered States"), a Vietnam-vet Black Panther from the bayous of Louisiana and an ex-astronaut (the lone survivor of the Gemini IV disaster) running for U.S. Senator.<br/><br/>Current project is a PTA series entitled "Sanduski's Rock", which is a family drama set on a mining colony in space.  Characters are all children of Conrad Sanduski, the mine supervisor:  Saul, the oldest, is a firebrand labor activist (i.e. a space-Wobbly). Kyle, the middle child, is a high-school jock coming to grips with his sexuality.  Natalie, the youngest, feels ignored and is acting out by seeking dangerous thrills.

Now when I *do* game with the OH group I'm a lot more relaxed and not as inclined to "fix" their gaming, since I know I've got other outlets for my crazy hippie gaming. <br/><br/>So, go gaming polygamy! OK, that sounds deeply odd. Anyway...<br/><br/>In answer to your original question, though, there are a lot of reasons. Scheduling is a biggie for me. I'm married with one child, and my wife and I both work. So, not as much flexibility when trying to juggle commitment to two groups. For other people it might be a lack of interested players, geographical limitations, or who knows what. So, even if the motivation is there, there may be obstacles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212006/#Comment_212006" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T14:11:40+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  2:11PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2009 2:12PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Limited free time is definitely the main obstacle to gaming multiple nights a week.  There was a brief window of time where work, social, and family responsibilities let us all fit in two or maybe even three sessions a week as adults, but that passed as soon as people started getting houses and better jobs and kids.  We make a commitment to play once a week and we can do that, but playing twice?  That ain't going to happen with my schedule.<br/><br/>Our group seems to have sidestepped Judd's problem, though; we tend to run games that have ENDINGS, and the idea of a game lasting years just sounds weird to me now.  (Our games last anywhere from 10 to 24 sessions, I'd guess...3-6 months' worth of gaming.)  And that's not including weeks where not everyone can make it there, when we might decide to play something else or watch movies or whatever.<br/><br/>So when someone has a burning need to test-drive the "New Hotness," well, there's not really an "Olde Hotness" standing in the way.  Wait a couple of weeks until the current game ends and make your pitch, or wait until the Saturday when someone has to work and pitch it as a smaller-group one-shot, or whatever.  If it sounds good, we'll play it.  If it IS good, we'll keep playing it.<br/><br/>Just, you know...not for years and years and years without stopping.  Because 3-6 months from now, we're going to want to wrap it up so that we can play something ELSE.<br/><br/><br/>It's this attitude more than anything else that I think makes playing exclusively with the same gaming group work for us.  Everyone likes endings, everyone likes switching things up and playing in a different genre or with a different GM or with different rules or what have you.  Keeps things from getting stale.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212027/#Comment_212027" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T15:15:48+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  3:15PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like my friends a thousand times more than I like games.

Before 1997 I never thought of gaming as anything other than that weird but fun thing my friends and I did together. <br/><br/>I never collected Dragon magazine, didn\u2019t belong to any online gaming BBs or IRC gamer related channels, and I didn\u2019t read fantasy novels. I would see these inviting new game books at my local library and wonder\u2026 who exactly is playing these besides my friends?<br/><br/>In 1997 I attended Origins, my first convention and wow. Seriously wow. Not only did I have a chance to play different games but play with different people. And I love people. And I love gaming. It was pure joy. Gaming wasn\u2019t some secret thing. Nor was it special. Which was freeing. <br/><br/>Before 2003 I never thought of gaming as anything other than that amazingly cool thing I do with my friends at home and strangers at Origins and Gencon.<br/><br/>In 2003 a friend of a friend of a friend named Aaron started nerdnyc (which at the time was tiny and consisted mostly of Aaron\u2019s friends and a few others). At Aaron\u2019s wedding my gaming friend\u2019s sister met Aaron\u2019s friends and was all like \u201cYou guys play D&amp;D? That\u2019s that thing that my brother and his friends do! You should all meet.\u201d<br/><br/>We did!<br/><br/>And then we met Luke Crane and his crew through Aaron. And it turns out that for many years prior to meeting any of them, I worked 2 blocks from where Luke lived and 1 block from where Aaron gamed. For years I thought gaming was just this weird thing my friends did at home or strangers did at far away conventions.<br/><br/>Before there was an IPR (Indie Press Revolution), Aaron and Luke and friends were essentially IPR (Aaron even helped brainstorm the initial IPR concept with Ed and Brennan who were also part of nerdnyc). They used to sell their friends games and games from the Forge from their backpacks at local NY, NJ, and Philly conventions. The whole indie game Dreamation thing started with Aaron, nerdnyc, Luke, and the burning wheel crew. Luke would run demos of people\u2019s games and then point them to the nerdnyc / burning wheel / indie game booth. <br/><br/>Back to gaming monogamy. I had limited time but I wanted to play as many games with as many different people as possible. And due to Aaron and Luke\u2019s efforts, the local scene was exploding, and there was no shortage of people to game with. <br/><br/>In 2004 my friend Tim and I started pitching in to help organize nerdnyc. And to solve our thirst for more gaming Tim and I came up with the Gotham Gaming Guild. I didn\u2019t want to play or hang out less with my old friends. So we brought all our friends together and all their gaming groups together. And every other Friday for 6-8 sessions, twice a year, we mixed everyone up and formed new groups with new and old friends to play new games! 5 years later we\u2019re still rocking. <br/><br/>Tomorrow we\u2019re running our all day 4 times a year gaming event Recess\u2026 which is partly why I\u2019m so excited and nostalgic (and I just finished listening to Clint\u2019s interview with Luke on the Stabbing Contest podcast which reminded me how awesome Luke is and how much I like him). <br/><br/>Interestingly, as we grew, a significant portion of the new people joining our community were actually former gamers (like used to game 10+ years ago), never gamed before, or were the friends or family of existing gamers. This is how I met the love of my life who used to game and was a friend of a friend connected to someone through nerdnyc. There is a lot of opportunity out there and many interesting and fun people to play with!<br/><br/>Rock,<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212062/#Comment_212062" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T20:36:15+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  8:36PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know heaps of gamers, all of whom know heaps of gamers. <b>Nobody</b> is going to get upset if you join a new gaming group, unless you're actually leaving an old one (in an uncool way) to do so.<br/><br/>But yeah, adulthood.

Most gamers follow the 'weekly poker night' pattern - it is a way to spend time with your friends, and create common experiences by doing the same thing, working on the same skills, for long periods of time. Not that story gamers don't want that, and create it, but on top of that we look for other things - experimentation, intensity, exploration, different story structures besides the heroic journey. On top of that, once you have a group that's been together five years or more, you are probably talking about families and children involved, where the players have an absolute lust to spend time with adults, and that five hours of poker is their time with peers. I've babysat enough to develop a searing hatred of Barney the Dinosaur, something I think every parent of a young child can understand.<br/><br/>Last week my sister begged me to take her to a movie that wasn't an animated cartoon.<br/><br/>MJ's called-shot-sneak-attack-critical-to-the-head that killed the ogre mage in one shot six months ago replace LeBron's 50-point triple-double, D&amp;D replaces watching cars go around a track, or a bowling league.<br/><br/>If your group of six musketeers has been in the same bowling league for ten years, and you start a pool league, the impulse to get everyone on board is natural and powerful, and if you fail to do that, it drains your enthusiasm for the project, even if your group is fine with you doing something new. Another example: inviting someone new to join, or <i>replacing</i> one of the regulars with a stranger, even temporarily, is something that has to be negotiated carefully to avoid stepping on people's feelings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez" title="Omar_Ramirez"><img alt="Omar_Ramirez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/370/nVR0Z4SVM1FWT.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez">Omar_Ramirez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212179/#Comment_212179" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-13T22:11:15+00:00" title="June 13, 2009 10:11PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="color: navy;">In Guadalajara Mexico (where I live, obviously) you will be lucky to find people who RP... let alone people who play anything that's not DnD 3.5 or Vampire: The Mascarade.<br/><br/>People around here are really closed to new games... even to new versions of old games...
