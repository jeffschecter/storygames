I had in the past avoided these games for a couple of reasons, first because I always got the impression they were highly emotional, and don't always feel up to it.  Second, because I doubt my ability to improvise.  Here is a quick summary.<br/><br/>There were five of us at the table, and since I don't know everyone's last name I'm going to leave out names.  I do know that one person at the table is not particularly fond of indie games, at first I felt a little sorry for him because I knew he would have picked something else.  The other people at the table were more or less as seasoned as they come to indie games.<br/><br/>The game works like this: you get a character with a couple of driving traits and a motivation.  I was a seductive one eyed pirate who dressed all in black.  Also at the table was a Cartesian rationalist, an inquisitor who doubted his faith, a noblewoman murderer, and a bavarian scientist.  The mechanics basically give you a scene, and in your scene you have to incorporate a random story element, some other previous random story element, and then pass off to the next character.  We ended up passing to the left, which might not have been necessary, but with five players seemed to keep the complexity down.  Because of this your character ends up linked with the other characters in the game.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game I had multiple affairs, including killing the sister of another character.  I was dealt the motivation of wager, meaning I had made some ridiculous bet and felt obligated to stick with it.  My first random item was the whale itself, so I may have stolen a bit from Moby Dick.  I was surprised at the direction this took.  The other players were much more forgiving to my character than Melville was.<br/><br/>Some other highlights include: a murderous English lady and pirate queen selling the lover of another character to the Turks; a master swordsman inquisitor who seeking and finding revenge for his time as a galley slave; a scientist seeking only ways to humanely kill people, including from poisons to self sharpening swords and guillotines watching has master plans carried off; and a man who sought to understand the true nature of death finding out the hard way.<br/><br/>This was a really awesome game.  My initial internal reaction to the English lady declaring herself a pirate was negative, after all that was one of the two distinguishing characteristic of my character.  But I got over that fast and was glad.  The player who did it was very good about taking it in a different direction than me and not stepping on toes.  Even the person who I know/suspect doesn't like indie games seemed to have a good time, though I don't think it really changed his mind.<br/><br/>In response I went to check the free downloads for Norwegian Style, to see if my impressions about these games were really off.  It seemed like a fifty-fifty mix of what I would expect.  Then I noticed the almost ridiculously low price on lulu (for the length of this book) and was sold.  Hopefully soon I'll have a chance to play some more of these.  I'm definitely looking forward to it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251301/#Comment_251301" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-18T17:06:37+00:00" title="January 18, 2010  5:06PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bravo for taking a chance on this game.

It again delivered and everyone chewed the scenery and seemed to enjoy it a lot. It reminds me of Baron Munchausen, but improved with the addition of focused thematic elements and mechanical reincorporation, so that in practice it isn't people telling isolated stories, but a conversation in which each player's narration builds upon and includes the contributions of others.<br/><br/>One thing I noticed in both games was some confusion around the third of four turns, where things just start to get a little Byzantine and unravel. Tracking the fiction, which by that time has taken many, many weird turns, becomes hard, and people make missteps (like bringing somebody back to life, or declaring somebody a Protestant when it was established that they were a Catholic). I think experience would mitigate this. It was also suggested that <i>not </i>drawing a new element a time or two wouldn't hurt anything, and I think this is true - a story emerges and adding an evil uncle, while fun, may not always make it better.<br/><br/>The cinematic, over-the-top setting, combined with GMless play, makes this game drift toward gonzo on first play, and that's a tone it accommodates well. I'd love to play a game where everybody was trying to keep it grounded, though! It'd be a challenge with all the twins, poisoned perfumes, and interrupted duels!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_251367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251367/#Comment_251367" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T06:55:45+00:00" title="January 19, 2010  6:55AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>You may also like Until We Sink.</blockquote>The same method, but a more low-key setting.

Try it as a game apart from any other, so you get to indulge in the mellow mood of it. Or try to play UWS first, and then something more frivolous.<br/><br/>I find UWS to be, by far, the strongest of the two games. To me it is the one and only game that has become a turning-point in my own work with rpgs; there is the time before I played UWS, and the time after.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251541/#Comment_251541" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T04:34:26+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  4:34AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Weird, we found it a little bit lackluster - we had to work really hard to make it work.

It was a good game, to be sure, but it was a lot looser. Some of this is our play style. My view of things over the last few years of play is that we engage the mechanics hard and are less comfortable than some other groups in free play without mechanics. UWS seems to require of its players the ability to not only engage in lots of free play, but to free associate. In the Belly of the Whale is much more mechanically driven, and focuses the attention inward, toward the center of the characters, instead of outward, toward the world.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I got to ride a poop joke very hard throughout UWS, so that was a blast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251550/#Comment_251550" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T06:23:47+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  6:23AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton</cite>so that was a blast.</blockquote>\n[rimshot]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_251627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251627/#Comment_251627" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-20T13:46:01+00:00" title="January 20, 2010  1:46PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton</cite>UWS seems to require of its players the ability to not only engage in lots of free play, but to free associate.</blockquote>Maybe that is why we Norwegians love it so much ...<br/><br/>A game leaves players with different feelings, and that is alright.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251967/#Comment_251967" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-21T22:56:08+00:00" title="January 21, 2010 10:56PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Magnus loves poop jokes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
