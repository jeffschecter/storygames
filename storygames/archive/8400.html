This is a bit long, and I apologize, so if you just want to skip to the good stuff, it's this: relationship map + GM-less play. <br/><br/>First, a smidge of background: my friend and I (who used to play D&amp;D, GURPS, and...uh, Battletech back in the 80's &amp; 90's with a larger group), got together a few months ago and started playing and playtesting all the cool new games that we'd be oblivious to for the decade or so that we weren't into RP.  The Mythic GM emulator was a big catalyst to this, and has been a faithful companion as we took FATE, Wushu, Savage Worlds, Reign, and others out for a spin, occasionally with other players dropping in for cameos.  We quickly discovered that we're both more into story than mechanics, but that cool mechanics still give us a bit of a thrill.  Also, with the exception of Reign, the role of GM as been largely superfluous.<br/><br/>Anyway, we've been taking the approach of "two spies/normal guys/space marines are plunged into such-and-such situation, and need to figure out the mystery/stop the international conspiracy/reach the goal," plot-oriented stuff, and it's been a lot of fun.  But last time we got together, we started tossing around the idea of creating an ensemble of characters, and mining the inevitable conflicts between them for some character-oriented goodness.  The idea is that we frame a scene we both find interesting, pick the characters we each want to play from the pool, and play it out.  We did one short proof-of-concept using Wushu, and it was pretty cool.<br/><br/>But now we're considering other systems that may work better for this, and so I come to you.<br/><br/>Because of the character issue focus, we're looking to use PTA next time, but all the countless "[PTA] I don't quite get it" threads makes me a little gun shy, especially since we'd be hacking it on our very first use of it.<br/><br/>So...I guess what I'm getting at is this: I know this general idea will work, but I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on a system that might really shine in this instance.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185620/#Comment_185620" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-01T16:01:22+00:00" title="January  1, 2009  4:01PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it sounds like something "Universalis" could do pretty well.  <br/><br/>PTA isn't too hard to get playing in, it just has some nuances that throw people at times.  I was mostly clear on the first run through of it.  PTA does require a Producer/Cast split out of the box, though.<br/><br/>Not sure if "In a Wicked Age" would be a very good 2 player choice, as I have no practical play experience with it.  Can someone else give an opinion?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185622/#Comment_185622" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-01T16:15:44+00:00" title="January  1, 2009  4:15PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ensemble of characters and mining the conflicts between them?<br/><br/>I'd say In A Wicked Age.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185730/#Comment_185730" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-02T12:20:16+00:00" title="January  2, 2009 12:20PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Contenders is a great GM-less game with an ensemble cast of NPCs.
