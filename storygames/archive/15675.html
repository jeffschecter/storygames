In a single session, we may not have enough time for the info on our character sheets, like HX with other players, to move from "words on my sheet" to something we're emotionally invested in. I see players writing, "Bob is my best friend" but then we start playing and it's just words. There is no emotional weight to it. <br/><br/>2. The other issue is there aren't explicit character goals or ways to externalize or communicate motivations. Which isn't a bad thing for regular play, it just makes it harder to hit on what the players actually care about. Of course even if you do communicate these things, you run into problem <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>. Going from just words to emotional investment. <br/><br/><b> Solutions I've seen:</b><br/><br/>1. Meg from Brilliant Gameologists made Highlight Stats part of the fiction. You don't Highlight Stats Player to Player but Character to Character. Sarah highlights Bob's Hot because "last session" (even if we didn't play last session) things were getting hot and heavy between them. <br/><br/>Idea: what if we used our HX as inspiration for which Stats to highlight from the character's perspective?  <br/><br/>2. My friend Jon noted that the way Apocalypse World builds investment is by giving players lots of cool stuff. Moves, Gear, places, vehicles, responsibilities, and people they know. If you threaten the Gunluggers' gun... emotions are high and drama is in full effect. Jon had all of us, for each of our cool things, choose an NPC and say how they are connected to it. This built immediate buy in into the setting but bogged the game down.<br/><br/>Idea: what if you take Jon's idea but only do it to your 2 favorite cool things. You still get buy in but the added benefits of making the process faster and having the player communicate which of their cool things they think are the coolest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355352/#Comment_355352" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-22T16:05:22+00:00" title="January 22, 2012  4:05PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2012 4:20PM by Noofy.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Frontload the situation. Have a couple of fronts and threats and more than one countdown. Outline just how unbalanced the staus quo is. Write love letters to the playbooks based on this situation that drive options toward PvP tension and answering stakes questions through play. This I think is what creates the best immedicay and sucks the players in. We want to play this shit right now! Hatchet City Blues is Vx's example of just this.<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://lumpley.com/apocalypse/hatchetcity.pdf<br/>\n<br/>\nI also like to have props: Barter currency (bullet casings, condoms, bottletops, whatever), scrapbooks of NPC portraits to choose from, a poorly detailed but evocative geographical map &amp; map making equipment (large sheets of paper, art supplies map pins), post it notes, matchbox cars, minis from various board games, a bowl of various cool d6s. Whatever you can think of to immerse your players.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also like to push provacative questions about relationships during chargen to drive the players to outline further details of their connections with other players / NPCs, similar to DW bonds. For each triangle generated I allow them to marrk an experience circle, so that they need less marked stat checks to advance. This advance invariably happens in play and allows them to choose a cool new move.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsk again over at Barf Forth, I'm sure folks will have lots of suggestions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355353/#Comment_355353" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-22T16:12:20+00:00" title="January 22, 2012  4:12PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Keep the setup tight and focused.

Who feels like playing a leader type? Do you want to be a Chopper and her gang, an Operator and his crew, a Hocus and her cult, or a Hardholder and his inner circle? Any of those are fine. We'll play out a serious problem facing the group and see how it turns out."<br/><br/>I might say a thing or two about the "leader" playbooks, but generally people get what they're about.<br/><br/>Then, by doing the setup stuff in the leader playbook (cult, gang, gigs, or holding) you end up with an obvious problem (or several). The GM picks one, thinks of a way to frame it in the opening scene, then off you go.<br/><br/><b>Conserve NPCs!</b><br/>When you're asking questions during chargen, don't ask about each PC's connections seperately, or you'll end up with way too many NPCs to deal with in the one-shot. Instead, ask group-level stuff. "Who do you get your ammo from? Where do you eat? Who makes your clothes?." Just a couple of those are fine. I generally use 3 or 4 key NPCs in a one-shot, and maybe only 1 or 2 of those end up being important to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355354/#Comment_355354" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-22T16:23:18+00:00" title="January 22, 2012  4:23PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2012 4:23PM by John_Harper.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, check out this thread on the AW forums (Vincent shares his demo method):<br/><br/><a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=2240" rel="nofollow">http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=2240</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355358/#Comment_355358" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-22T16:48:03+00:00" title="January 22, 2012  4:48PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John (jenskot),<br/><br/>Here's an idea about using love letters to hook everyone into a situation.

Make the players care about overlapping stuff, and make the PCs deal with each other.  <br/><br/>Maybe this is AW heresy, but for a one shot I'd really want to either (a) turn the PC group into an adventuring party, or (b) have them all opposed and trying to kill each other.  <br/><br/>"You do your thing over here, I'll do my thing over there," while it has given me great one-shots in other games, seems like a waste of an AW one-shot to me.<br/><br/>One technique might be to bring a list of Fronts, ask the group to pick whichever one interests them most, and then ask each player to say why this particular scarcity is central to their character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chroma" title="Chroma"><img alt="Chroma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/n1N2ZVK30JJ00.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chroma">Chroma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355369/#Comment_355369" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-22T17:38:29+00:00" title="January 22, 2012  5:38PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run four one-shot/demos in the past year (that's as long as I've had AW!

Don't spend too long writing this stuff.<br/><br/><b>WHEN YOU START</b><br/><br/>Ask, "Who runs this place?" Wait until someone elects themself, and then toss that set of playbooks at them.<br/>Ask, "Who works security?" When someone volunteers, toss that set of playbooks at them.<br/>Ask, "Who wheels and deals?" Same thing. "Who causes problems?" Same thing.<br/><br/>Then, read the text on the back cover of Apocalypse World. Introduce yourself. Explain what the game is about. Explain what playbooks are.<br/>Tell everyone to pick one of the options you gave them, and then read their flavour text aloud.<br/>Do the character creation thing.<br/><br/>Ask lots of leading questions while you idly sketch a map. Start by turning to the person who runs stuff, and ask, "Whereabouts is your community located?" Then turn to the security person, and ask something about outside threats. Turn to the wheeler-dealer, and ask what kinds of things people do to make ends meet and earn a little jingle. Turn to the problem causer, and ask who's frustrated with the local leader and what they plan to do to change things. Ask questions about the town, as you sketch a map of it.<br/><br/>Great. You've got some ideas. You've got a map. Put it down and say, "Here's our map. We're not going to leave this map during this play session, unless it becomes super necessary. This is the world we're going to play in, alright?"<br/><br/>Continue asking questions. At some point, someone will give an answer that sounds like an opening scene, and say, "Great, let's start there. You say you're having an affair with the bronze-smith's wife? Well, today, where are the two of you meeting?"<br/><br/>Then just follow your Principles and make Hard Moves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355411/#Comment_355411" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T02:50:30+00:00" title="January 23, 2012  2:50AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2012 2:54AM by John_Harper.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like I said in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13941" rel="nofollow">the other thread</a>, I like Joe's method a lot.

They just don't work for me and, alongside the harm rules, are among the few parts of AW that I think could really use some work.  The kinds of setups that Joe and John are talking about work much better for me in practice.  I've actually thought about writing up a convention scenario that's a tighter, more focused version of what Vincent was attempting with "Hatchet City," but haven't quite gotten around to it yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's important to also have a sense of what you're trying to do with a convention one-shot.  For example, at PAX, I ran AW for a table of 7-8 players and there was just no way that everyone was going to be able to be tightly woven into the game.  I was just attempting to show people what AW was, not have a session that was as quality as it would have been with 3-4 players.  So, I made sure that everyone got to make a couple moves, but the session really focused on the issues of a smaller subset of the players, specifically the guys playing the Operator and the Hardholder, who were catalysts for everybody else doing stuff.  The players loved that session and a bunch of them came back and wanted to play again later, so I guess it worked, but you really have to dive right into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking a map as the players are describing where they live and what they do is critical, like Joe says.  I sketched their hardhold and the nearby airfield where they received goods (which they traded buried ammo and scrap from the abandoned military base they lived in).  The great thing about playing an Operator and their crew is that you an start the session with a moonlighting roll, which gets things underway one way or another.  If you just had a successful mission, now you did something probably objectionable or have something valuable and maybe somebody else wants it to.  If you botch the roll a bit, you're in the middle of it and that's a great way to kick off a session.  In fact, for a convention scenario, I'd suggest going with the Operator every time, though some other options work fine too.  The Operator is just the easiest.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that works really well in AW is setting up a couple NPCs as being total merciless badasses that want nothing more than to destroy everything the players care about.  Just pick a name off the name list and be like: "Tum Tum, shiiiiiiiiiit.  That guy will slit your throat just as soon as look as you.  He and his gang are a bunch of dead-on cannibals that everybody is terrified of.  They mostly hand out over here (draw area on map)."  That gives the game a nice vibe, that the world is full of crazy desperate people, and makes the characters feel sympathetic even if they are murderous bastards, because there are total sociopaths out there to provide some contrast.  "My job is 'doing murders' but at least I'm not a cannibal chieftain like Tum Tum."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355451/#Comment_355451" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T09:06:41+00:00" title="January 23, 2012  9:06AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is all amazing! <br/><br/>Please keep it coming if you have more to share.

First, I joined a game that was already in progress, though we started as a seperate group playing in the same setting, before the two groups were combined. The MC sketched out the map of the territory and we decided where we were and what we were doing. The second time, I suggested a game set in Near-Earth Orbit, and the players then picked what kind of space station they had and what was going on. Setup still works the same, but -- with a general premise already established -- the MC has the ability to cultivate a mind full of appropriate apocalyptic imagery and evan have a couple of ideas about Front before the first session begins, which lets you jump into things a bit more. I still think you want to start with the characters handling some normal day-to-day activity, but in AW that's awesome and dangerous, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, I think the official MC play materials for handling Fronts are also not super useful and don't help me run the game very much.  The countdown clocks are cool, but listing all the characters associated with it and all the other stuff you have to do... just not as evocative and immediately helpful as it could be.  Honestly, the first thing I'm going to do before running AW again is come up with some better Front sheets, listing the Front moves, room for custom moves associated with that front, the stats for gangs or important stuff the Front has, and other handy tools. And tying all that more interestingly to the fundamantal scarcity would be cool too, because that always seems to get lost somewhere along the way. Also, a better Homefront sheet would also be great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355480/#Comment_355480" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T12:13:19+00:00" title="January 23, 2012 12:13PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should note that I have never run Apocalypse World as a convention game but I've played in over 10 con games with different GMs and players.

The front creation stuff is good for inspiration but I've found it impossible to do as written - my problem, not the game's.<br/><br/>This weeding-out-playbooks advice does not apply to AW hacks at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355482/#Comment_355482" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T12:19:20+00:00" title="January 23, 2012 12:19PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>The front creation stuff is good for inspiration but I've found it impossible to do as written - my problem, not the game's.</blockquote>\nI'd love to hear more about that, Jason!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355483/#Comment_355483" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T12:22:56+00:00" title="January 23, 2012 12:22PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 23, 2012 12:24PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me there's too much stuff happening before contact with the players in a one-shot when you build fronts as written, so I look over the lists of threats, which are great, and come up with some vague ideas, and then wing it.

And, y'see, I find myself really wanting to ignore some of the most common advice by giving my players pregens. Everything I've read so far suggests that chargen is one of the most fun bits of the game, and I shouldn't skip it. Here's why I want to ignore that advice:<br/><br/>1) In the past when demoing BW at cons (and other one-shots) I've moved away from Luke's advice regarding beliefs and gone for ensuring my pregens all have intersecting, conflict-rich beliefs and instincts. Why? Well, I tried it the other way, and it both took too long for some players to come up with them, and some came up with pretty lame ones despite my influence and encouragement. We also kinda went at the speed of the slowest player, and it led to some players getting gazumped by others from cool beliefs (man, he wants to burn the heretics? I wish I'd played the priest!). On the other hand, when I made an overly-complex matrix of intersecting and contradictory beliefs, players still got to choose which ones to focus on, and nobody ended up with weak reasons for being in the thick of the action. (Like, you want to kill X and/or fuck Y and/or steal Z - which of these agenda do you want to pursue?)<br/><br/>2) I'm looking at 3-hour slots and don't want to run out of time - I want to create something meaningful and meaty in that time. In my own con-GMing, I tend to think of the 3 most important things as pace, pace, and pace, so I don't want anything in there that might rely on us moving at the speed of the slowest player - if you get my drift?<br/><br/>I'm thinking of providing pregens but leaving some phases of the setup in as a group exercise - either the Hx relationships ('cause I think the players will dig them, and they have their own pacing mechanic), or the initial setup (because the Hx thing might be confusing!), or some love-letter-style initial move to determine the status within the setup.<br/><br/>Is this heresy? Is it doomed to failure? Am I just a con-GM control freak?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357867/#Comment_357867" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-05T09:41:59+00:00" title="February  5, 2012  9:41AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2012 9:42AM by Ross_Cowman.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My advice, try it before you hack it.<br/>In some other discussion John Harper said this cool thing about trying to meet a game at its own level. I think that is a great approach, esp for something like apocalypse world which really asks for a different set of GMing principals then other games you may have played. <br/><br/>I worked really hard to MC this game. I'm still working on it. But I can say that it really does work, every time. Even in a 3 hour game slot. You really gotta let go and trust your players to enjoy this game. <br/><br/>The thing is, making characters and explaining moves takes half an hour once you got it down, and you're still playing the game. Asking questions, drawing stuff on the map, setting up PC NPC triangles, finding out those little details that start to form the world.<br/><br/>"You're wearing a <i>Suit of Armor</i>? like from the middle ages?"<br/>"No like from a gaming store."<br/>"awesome."<br/><br/>If you want to write a scenario out, pre-gen the characters, be my guest.

But there's nothing wrong with start with semi-pre-genned characters either.

But just to be clear, the MC should come to the game with a strong creative vision, preferences, and goals. You're not a blank slate or merely a mirror to hold up to the players. Cultivate that head full of apocalyptic imagery. Dream up a bunch of cool NPCs, problems, situations, and slot them into your MC bandolier, ready to be deployed during setup and as you go. Definitely ask questions and disclaim responsibility <i>sometimes</i>, but don't be afraid to lay down the law and have a strong hand, too.<br/><br/>That said, I would never do pregens for AW.
