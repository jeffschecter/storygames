                    First, this deals with something from traditional Game Theory, not RPG Theory (though, of course I'm applying it to RPGs).<br/>
<br/>
Second check this out: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem</a><br/>
<br/>
Very basically, some effects of probability are what's termed "Verdical Paradoxes." That is, they seem paradoxical, but aren't. Meaning that they are highly non-intuitive.<br/>
<br/>
Most RPG players aren't interested in the effects of the game mechanics farther than generally understanding the overall propensities of the system. That is, to somebody rolling 2d6 and adding them together, they're more interested to know that getting a result outside the center is less likely than an end result than to know that the exact chance of getting a 12 are 1:36.<br/>
<br/>
There are various reasons for this, but in most cases it comes down to the fact that decisions made in these games have little to do with the expected values over many repititions. Though, I have to admit, I've seen it in D&amp;D - lesse, if I have a 50% chance to hit, and do an average of 4.5 HP damage per hit, and the opponent has an average of 15 Hit Points, then it'll take me an average of eight rounds before I bring him down, as compares with his output rate of....<br/>
<br/>
Well, you get the idea. Even here, however, we're dealing with relatively simple odds, and a situation that Ralph Mazza once refered to as something like "dice-pool resolution stretched out over several sets of rolls." Even in D&amp;D, in most cases, the player will simply take a stab at his odds to figure out if he has a chance to win (and then will usually stick around to see if he beats the odds, even against a bigger foe, until it becomes unsafe not to run).<br/>
<br/>
So you largely have players doing gross estimates of their chances to win, or have a particular effect, and the system promotes X or Y depending on what those percieved odds are.<br/>
<br/>
But this is where the perception and reality gap comes into play. There are many cases where the acuall odds don't match the player's perception of what they are. Going back to the 2d6 example, we have what's often referred to as a "Bell Curve" that actually being the shape of the classic 3D6 curve from D&amp;D. The RPG gaming community knows the shape of that curve in large part due to Mr. Gygax putting it in one of his books to educate us (I daresay that's where I started my lifelong penchant for probability and statistics that eventually lead to my current job doing business analysis). But for somebody unfamiliar with the idea of the "Bell Curve," many people think that rolling an 18 is just as likely as rolling an 11.<br/>
<br/>
But, OK, because of gamer education, we don't have to worry about this (though that does leave the uneducated non-gamer out in the cold a tad, no?). Let's look at one that the gamers all get wrong, too. Heck, even designers get this one wrong too. Came up recently in a discussion of a system where you roll a d20, 1's are fumbles, and 20s are crits (not HQ, actually). Basically somebody commented that these results created a lot of excitement when they occured. Which would, in part, seem to be predicated on the idea that they're rare.<br/>
<br/>
But, in the system in question, you roll the dice a lot. So the actual chance of getting very far without getting one of these special results is actually pretty low. Basically the event in question is being given special credit for being rare that it simply doesn't deserve.<br/>
<br/>
There are better examples of this effect. In some dice pool system, for example (I got thinking of this based on Shreyas' latest mechanics ideas, which actually are not examples of this, though The Pool is), you check for something like any sixes coming up as being victorious. What most people will think is, "Aha, if I roll 6 dice, then I should get one six." And that is the "expected value." But many would be surprised to learn that the chance to roll at least one six on the dice is slightly less than 2:3.<br/>
<br/>
Players, of course, will act on their perception of the odds. Now, over time, with many rolls, the system can sorta inform the players of what the actual odds are. But even then I think that the original perception remains, and the player will still make decisions not propelled entirely by the actual odds.<br/>
<br/>
I know Sorcerer does this to people, players who do not realize that the system strongly favors the underdog.<br/>
<br/>
Now, that said, I think Ron's aware of this, and left it in the system for a reason.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That leaves us with two subjects for discussion:<br/>
- Do these problems of perception cause problems in some games in that the mechanics don't produce the desired behaviors because people don't understand the actual odds?<br/>
- Are there times when you'd want to use this perception difference to effect? How would you do it, and why? If you did, what would be the affect of the rare person (nerds like myself, basically) who came to understand what the actual odds of the system are?<br/>
<br/>
Or is this effect too negligible to matter?<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts?<br/>

                            Mike, <br><br>I think the "wiff factor" that frustrates so many players in so many games is partly due to this syndrome. Especially in cumulative roll situations, ie "Well I need an 11 to hit this guy and I've missed the last three rounds, so I must have a better chance of hitting with this roll! It would be statistically improbable for me to miss three in a row!" I know folks who've been playing for 20 years who still do that. <br><br>Situations like this can be troublesome in gamist games played hardcore, as if someone doesn't realize and doesn't learn what their odds really are they may have real trouble being competative. I've seen it happen to folks in D&amp;D con games: one time too many they put their faith in the bell curve (or more accuratly, what they think the bell curve means) and then are shocked as hell when they get lower than a 7 on 2d6, because the "average roll" should have been good enough for them. <br><br>As far as using it to effect: well... couldn't it be used for illusionsit/participationist systems? I mean, if you could build a system in which the actual odds of fatal failure (or plot-breaking overwhelming successes) was actually minute, but where it seemed to most players like there was a real danger of sudden death on every roll, it could help give that sense of tension based on false risk that we all know so well.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Heya,<br>
<br>
In games where the object is to "win" something, then knowing the statistical odds could be important.  As Brand mentioned, a Gamist player may look at a 55% chance of success and make a gutcheck call to go for it because the odds of winning are slightly better than not.  However, if he had no idea what the odds are, then his decision will be based on feelings.  Does he "feel" he can win?  Does he "feel" he needs to at least try to win?  Does he "feel" like risking something at this point in the game?  I think this is what Ron called the Crunch and the Gamble in his Gamist article.<br>
<br>
I'm glad you brought this up.  A designer should know what sort of decisions he wants the players to make.  Does he want them to make decisions based on statistical odds or on feelings?  Once he understands his answer to that question, he should write rules, procedures, and hints that support making those kinds of decisions.  At least, in my oppinion he should.<br>
<br>
Peace,<br>
<br>
-Troy<br>
<br>
PS: I know that your questions go way beyond Gamist agendas in play, but it's what I'm familiar with.  So that's why I answered the way I did. :)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            It's certainly easiest to analyze this question in light of gamist play, given that Game Theory certainly applies most directly to Gamist play.<br/>
<br/>
Let me clarify that. Game Theory comes from the field of mathematics, and, as such is rather rigorous. So it can, at times, have difficulty dealing with abstracts such as social rewards. Oh, sure, in gamist games, social rewards exist, but they're usually directly linked to hard game determined rewards.<br/>
<br/>
In games that are more about theme, the question becomes how to estimate the value of something like a social reward given for good roleplaying.<br/>
<br/>
But it's not impossible. For one thing, we usually constrain ourselves to what the hard game rules will tend to produce as a subset of what the overall social contract will produce. Further, even where there's ambiguity, Game Theory allows for this by having ways of estimating the value of rewards in gross terms.<br/>
<br/>
So, yeah OK, go with gamism examples where they clear things up, but try to extend them beyond if possible. Or, if you think that Game Theory breaks down at this point, please explain why.<br/>
<br/>
Troy, you bring up the idea of directed design in this way. Ron said once of Sorcerer that he was happy that the odds were opaque to the player, other than they know that more dice is better. Because that means that they will place the same value on prety much each die (with a beneficial diminishing return, so that people don't try for more and more and more bonus dice). I'm dubious that he planned it that way, but I believe he's honest about the outcome being effective - because having played it, it works.<br/>
<br/>
Brand, I'd agree that there's some potential there for Illusionist play potentially. But that's a problematic form of play made all the more problematic if you used something like this, and, as I mentioned, a player discovered the actual odds. Then what?<br/>
<br/>
And, yeah, the Coin Flipping Paradox is a classic - "I've flipped a dozen heads in a row, the next one is sure to come up tails!" The question is what happens in this case? Is this really a question of the player making a mistake? Or is it more often an excuse to play with a different agenda than trying to win? If it is an actual mistake, how does the game compensate? In D&amp;D, I'd suggest it doesn't, and that this is what leads to "fudging" quite a lot of the time. Can a game compensate? Should it?<br/>
<br/>
Should the game inform the players in the instructions as to what the actual odds are in this case, so that they're informed? If a player refuses to read the material, is he at fault somehow for not playing right? Or should he just take his lumps as a bad player?<br/>

I've seen an GM make this mistake. My character faced a series of challenges, with victory requiring success in them all. To making the contests interesting (not a foregone victory or defeat), each probability of success was broadly 50%. The resulting probability of success was very low, which made the entire process futile.                        </div>

                            Although I'm far more interested in non-numerical aspects of RPGs (story and character development, immersion, etc.), I'm still enough of a math geek to be very picky about roll mechanics.  It's one of my pet peeves that not only so many gamers don't understand math and probabilities, but so many <b>game designers</b> are also stomped by the topic.  One example that came into play not too long ago when I ran an <i>octaNe</i> two-parter game: people had trouble grasping the fact that subtracting one die from your dice pool is not at all the same thing as knocking the highest result from a roll after the fact, i.e., the probability curve is very different because the results are no longer independent events.  (Then I saw on a 'Net discussion that author Jared Sorensen had originally missed that fact too...)<br/>
<br/>
My impression is that people have an easier grasp of measures of the concepts of central tendency and most probable number that of the concepts of dispersions, distribution, and skew.  Examples of games that seem to produce hinky results because of this include <i>Earthdawn</i> and the original version of <i>Deadlands</i>; in both these games, going up a level may actually be a bad thing because although your median expected result may go up, the difference in variance due to different dice type/size/pool may make success (rolling above an average difficulty threshold) <b>less</b> likely.<br/>
<br/>
As for the effects of the "rare nerd type"...  We have an example in our current gaming group: we have a statistician who loves to play narrative and story games -- and to "break" dice-rolling systems.  We usually entrust him with finding the flaws of new systems so we can patch them up or find a workaround ASAP.  He's currently helping us pick <i>Burning Empires</i> apart.                        </div>

                            Mike,<br><br>In my experience I have found that a subset of players get very frustrated when the probabilities for a roll are not transparent. And I have found that some players cannot parse die pool probabilities at all. Of those who think they can parse die pools, I found that nearly no one understands binomial distribution in the pools. And, playing into Mrs Anemone's disappointment, I did not objectively understand the probabilities for Burning Wheel when I first designed and released it. I thought I did! But I didn't.  I tried to remedy all of that by putting a probability chart in the Monster Burner. Burning Empires has a rough and rounded probability chart right at the front of the game. From my standpoint as a designer, it's in there less to inform players and more to cut down on complaints. <br><br>Why so? First, because I get bored with waiting for players to factor odds. In BW, you need to know if it's easy, kinda hard or really hard, that's it. Most of the time, that's pretty obvious. And second, because the probabilities for Burning Wheel are STILL opaque. Once you factor in exploding sixes into the equation, the probabilities of a test become monstroulsy difficult to determine.<br><br>-Luke                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

True that.  And of course the level of transparency depends both on the roll mechanic and the player's math skills.  I'm certainly one of those players who like to have at least a rough idea of odds when considering an action, which is why I tend to favour mechanics that use d10s -- I can multiply and divide by 10 faster than by 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, or 20!  :-)  <br><br>Going back to the Monty Hall veridical paradox, that particular example is similar to my <i>octaNe</i> example in that the two choices (picking a door out of three possibilities, and choosing whether to switch doors after being shown one of the goats) are not independent random events; the first choice influences which two doors will be left to pick from at the end.  Most people forget the difference, or have trouble understanding the difference, between independent and dependent events.                        </br></br></div>

                            Benedict, that's a classic example. I think that this effect is, in fact, the single biggest thing that leads to GM fudging strategies. My favorite example is the CoC module, "At the Mountians of Madness," which railroads the PCs into making dozens of skill checks, many of which are adventure-enders, if failure occurs.<br/>
<br/>
"Where do we go next?"<br/>
"I dunno, I failed the skill check."<br/>
<br/>
Bryan Bankhead wrote a series of rants on CoC that included this flaw over at the The Forge, if anyone is interested. But the adventure in question if 400 pages of source material, and if you're going to get through even a significant portion of it all, the GM is going to have to somehow mitigate some failures along the way either with fudging, or with manipulating the situation to make failures non-adventure-enders.<br/>
<br/>
So even in scenario design we see the problem of statistical ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
And, yeah, Sophie, it occurs in general design as well.<br/>
<br/>
So that's one obvious problem. The only solution I can see, however, is for designers to learn their probabilities - at least to the extent that they can judge general trends in what they're doing so they can avoid the aforementioned Earthdawn Step System problem - or to hand them over to somebody who does know them for review. This is the sort of problem that has the advantage that the solution is clear. Even if many people somehow miss the solution.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The problem with Paradoxes is less clear, however. Do we have to instruct players of the difference between a dependent and independent event, and how to identify which is which? At what point in a system do the odds become difficult enough to calculate that you need to do additional education for players? Or is it best to simply put in complicating factors so that the odds are relatively opaque? So that players make the judgments based on less information?<br/>
<br/>
With Burning Empires (or Wheel), it's enough to know that more dice mean more success. Right? Are there really players out there who sweat the question of precisely what their odds are with complex die pool systems? That said, if the odds are somewhat opaque, should a general sense be provided in terms of a chart like Luke does? Or is it enough that you give a sense of what a character's chances are by labeling the numerical level of their ability in a way that indicates how competent that level is likely to be? For instance, saying X dice is novice and Y dice is "expert." Does that suffice?<br/>
<br/>
What's interesting with BE is that, while there is an indication of how many dice equal what level of proficiency, often the level of actual dice rolled varies with things like FORKs. To what extent does BE assume that dice will be FORKed in (or otherwise included), when determining what level of ability is "expert?" Does the player need to realize that he has to do this FORKing to be capable? Or is the initial level large enough relatively speaking to give an idea of what the outcome tendencies will be?<br/>
<br/>
Or should systems try to be easy to calculate, like d20 (everybody knows the "multiply by 5%" algorithm)? Maybe a better question is whether or not that's actually as easy to understand as it seems, or whether the complexities of other rolls along with these standard skill rolls make what seems to be a transparent system actually opaque. Again, this is the case with Benedicts' example.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, with a game about player challenge, I think you can leave these calculations as precisely that - a player challenge. In which case, I think that we don't have to worry too much about transparency. But with a game in which you would rather the player be making decisions based on other criteria, I think this becomes a much more complicated question.<br/>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lukzu</cite>Why so? First, because I get bored with waiting for players to factor odds. In BW, you need to know if it's easy, kinda hard or really hard, that's it. Most of the time, that's pretty obvious. And second, because the probabilities for Burning Wheel are STILL opaque. Once you factor in exploding sixes into the equation, the probabilities of a test become monstroulsy difficult to determine.</blockquote>
See, an exploding dice pool <em>should</em> resolve down to a pretty simple equation.  My recent stabs at it on the back of an envelope reduce down to the probabilities for an unmodified die, though, so I suspect there's an error in my series somewhere.  Has anyone successfully produced this math, or is anyone interested in double-checking my work?                        </div>

                            It's true that games, both designs and the way people make choices, sometimes suffer from a lack of understanding of the probabilities or even just the mathematics involved.  Sometimes it's even basic math stuff that's really frustrating--for example in Shatterzone, where you can trade accuracy for damage in a shot.  But because successes over the difficulty get added to the effect anyway, that choice is nonsensical; it lowers the chance of a hit and doesn't yield more damage for the same roll.  Then again, this is the game that tells you it's easier to hit something far away than up close, because it doesn't move as much within your field of vision (which is true, but of course, moving the barrel of your gun a tiny bit has an incrementally higher effect on where your shot goes the longer the distance is, which is a much more important factor).<br><br>A couple of years ago, I actually started writing a book about math and dice probabilities specifically for gamers (RPGs and wargames) and designers.  I've still got the partial draft sitting on my HD, but my plan was too ambitious at the time (I wanted to provide complete charts and suggestions for all important roll decisions in the most important dice systems, and calculating those is obviously a huge undertaking).  Maybe I should just take the written sections and put them somewhere as introductory articles, because I still see a lot of misconceptions floating around even among supposedly educated gamers.                        </br></br></div>

                            Re: exploding dice.  It depends on whether the die can explode once or endlessly.  If once, the calculation is not that hard; each die produces on average 21/36 successes (hope I did that one right in my head <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.  That'd be 0.58 successes per die.  If you want to calculate the chance that you get at least once success, that's 1/2.  If you need two successes, your chance is 1/12.

                            As a general rule, exploding dice don't make that much of a difference when you are looking at getting an average result, but make a huge difference when getting rare results.  For instance, getting a 7+ result on 2d6 summed is exactly the same odds as getting a 7+ result on 2e6 (2d6 that explode on 6's).  [Why is this?  Missing a 7+ means none of the first two dice you rolled were a 6 =&gt; if any of the original two dice explode, you hit the target anyway].  However, it's a lot easier to hit 12+ on 2e6 than on 2d6. Still hard, but a lot more doable.                        </div>

                            I think it's instructive to look at gambling.<br>
<br>
Over time, your payout from gambling is always negative, always. You will always lose every penny of your money if you spend enough time gambling it in a casino, no matter what game you play, no matter how much money you have, no matter how lucky you are, you will always lose every penny eventually, period.<br>
<br>
Yet gambling is insanely popular and hugely addictive and fun.<br>
<br>
So even if we do have an accurate view of the payoffs over the long term, you still get that burst o' seratonin if you win something now. That's why there's not a lot of longitudinal probability analysis among gamers - like gamblers, that's not why we're playing.<br>
<br>
Could be interesting to design a game that relied on longitudinal stuff - or is that really what this 'scene resolution' jive is all about at its heart?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

Christian,<br><br>You can too.  It works out as an infinite series, and I'm reasonably confident that it converges.  Ergo, there's a finite sum equivalence.  I just keep screwing up the math.  I need to sit down and do it properly, but amongst other things I'm not certain about the finite form.  <br><br>And, it should go without saying: we're talking about the expectation of an exploding die.  If we're just looking for the chances of the result exceeding X, then we can figure the chances of exploding enough times to get in the range - that's cake.

Ed, <br><br>Also not so.  Certainly the example of 7+ on 2o6 (do you mind this notation?  2e6 looks like 2×106 to me) is valid, but any value more than 7, and exploding does have an impact.

The 7+ number was carefully chosen to make that statement true.  Paradoxically, the odds of hitting exactly 7 go down if we're using 2e6 instead of 2d6; if we roll a 6,1 on our first two dice it explodes to at least 8, whereas nothing explodes into 7 from less than 7.
<blockquote><br>but any value more than 7, and exploding does have an impact.  Obviously, 13+ is where you get the biggest effect, since 2d6 can't roll a 13.<br/></br></blockquote>
Right.  But as a general rule of thumb, exploding becomes more and more important the larger the  targets are.  It makes hitting an 8 a little easier it makes hitting a 12 or 13 a lot easier. <br> <br>And by "easier" I'm thinking "number of rolls to success".  If I've got 2d6, it will take me on average 36 rolls to hit a 12; if I have 2e6 it will take many fewer tries. If I'm trying for an 8 it will take about two rolls with either 2d6 or 2e6.<br><br>I do like the 2e6 notation (e for "exploding", clearly).  I will bow to precedence in the literature, of course.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>
