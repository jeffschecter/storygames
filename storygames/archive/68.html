                    Yeah, the topic name is intentionally inflammatory to get your attention. Ha. The fact is, I totally agree that play experience (and specifically, playtesting) is, like, the most important thing I can do as a game designer. <br/><br/>I want to talk about all the stupid fucking rationalizations I and other people use to justify sitting around and writing armchair RPGs.<br/><br/><b>I don't have time to play!</b> <br/>Yeah, but I have plenty of time to fuck around on Story Games and The Forge and RPGNet and LiveJournal/Blogspot. I apparently have enough time to twiddle with my dice mechanics and rewrite my rulebook for the ninth time. <br/><br/>I ran a one-hour demo of my game, Verge, for some fellow Forge Twunts at a small con in North Carolina a few months ago. I got valuable playtest feedback out of it. That made me realize that I don't need to run a 6-hour Saturday game to playtest. Maybe I could have one or two friends over on a weeknight, eat some pizza, and game for an hour or two. <br/><br/><b>I can't find people to play my game!</b><br/>Whine. If I can't find people to game at all, because I live in Montana or Nunavut or something, but I have Internet access, there are ways to play games online. If I have a regular gaming group or know a bunch of Vampire or D&amp;D players, but I can't convince them to give my weird indie game a whirl, why should I expect anyone else in the world to play it? <br/><br/>At the very least, post a link to your PDF on the Forge or something and ask people to play it for you. If your game is grabby enough, someone will try it.<br/><br/><b>But it's not done yet!</b><br/>And it never will be, at this rate, huh? I need to get my ass off LiveJournal and finish it. I have to put a "good enough" version out there on the net for people to read. Why isn't it done? Probably procrastination. Why am I procrastinating? Oh, the usual reasons: fear it isn't good enough, stuck on some aspect of the reward system, can't figure out how to explain the rules properly, rehashing and rewriting till my fingers bleed. <br/><br/>The best cure for all of those things is playtesting. It isn't good enough? Playtest and figure out why. My playtesters know it isn't done, or it wouldn't be playtesting. I'm stuck on some aspect of the rules? Playtest and figure out how to fix it. I can't figure out how to explain the rules in your manuscript? Playtest and explain the rules to a complete noob. I'll come away with a better idea of what is important to understand in my game. Rehashing and rewriting? I must be stuck on something or maybe I don't understand it well enough. Cure for that is -- yes, that's right -- playtesting.<br/><br/>What other dumb excuses do we use to justify armchair design, absent of playtesting, absent of playing other role-playing games?                </div>

                            In reference to "I can't find people" - post links to <a href="http://findplay.anvilwerks.com/" rel="nofollow">FindPlay</a> everywhere you post or write about games. Then use it.<br/><br/>How about <b>It's not good enough</b>. As you say, it's a subset of "but it's not done yet," but a particularly powerful one. There's a fear that actually playing something that you've poured time and energy and soul into, that you don't feel is done, will make everyone else sour on your game, and on you as a designer. This is gamer baggage. At some point you need to playtest, or it will never be good enough.                        </div>

                            One thing that kind of bothers me about this is, say I come into this enlightened new world with aspirations to be a game designer, and people say "well, if you wanna be a game designer you'd better play a whole damn shedload of games", and they're right, right? But it seems that often it's people's <i>bad</i> actual play experiences, rather than the good ones, which lead to the biggest inspirations. So does this mean I should deliberately subject myself to a load of bad gaming experiences, just so that I know what to design to avoid?<br/>
<br/>
(Yeah, so the comeback to this is: if you have nothing but perfect game sessions, why do you need a new game? I'm not saying that I don't get bad sessions, but there are bugbears of past game design which seem like totally bad ideas I'd like to avoid, and saying "yeah, I heard that that mechanic produces effect X, which sounds like it sucks" is a crappy way to justify a design decision.)                        </div>

                            The surest way to have lots of bad gaming experiences is to play lots of different games with lots of different people. Playing one RPG with the same group you've been gaming with for twenty years isn't going to make you a great designer.<br><br>And a "bad gaming experience" doesn't have to mean that the game is interrupted by a fistfight. Maybe most of the game that afternoon was good except for this one part where this particular rule just totally sucked. Inspiration results.<br/><br/>Should we intentionally subject ourselves to bad gaming experiences? Well, no, not intentionally. How about we subject ourselves to <i>diverse</i> gaming experiences -- and some bad ones will probably result, but that's not the goal -- and the diversity is what gives us a broader perspective on design. <br/><br/>When all you've seen is Ford minivans, you're probably not going to design a Volvo sedan or a Ferrari sports car or a VW Beetle or a Mac truck. You'll probably design shorter four-door minivans, really fast minivans with fins, cute little round minivans, and giant minivans for hauling freight. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>If you have perfect gaming sessions, why do you need a new game? Well, you might have the perfect Fantasy gaming sessions, but still need a good SF or Horror game. If you have the perfect game for all gaming you do, you probably won't design any more games. Other people might hate the game you use though, so they'll still design games. Not every game appeals to every person, no matter how well it is designed.                        </br></br></div>

                            the fact that a lot of people shoot of their mouths without thinking is not shocking to me. what is shocking is when tenured, talented designers say stupid shit like "I don't need an editor" or "playtesting is too time consuming".

                            The one that gets me is established companies who have fans who will playtest the fuck out of their game, who end up using playtesting more as a "proof of concept"  or way to create buzz than a serious look at the mechanics.  <br/><br/>One of my friends was playtesting a game and complained how the author simply dismissed his group's input because "You're not supposed to do that" (though it doesn't say that in the rules...).                        </div>

                            Yea verily, you speak the truth, Adam.  I have finally got a group of guys that I'm playing with regularly in a intentional and analytical vein, and I cannot believe how much it helps absolutely everything.  I have another reason why we often don't go out and play / playtest:<br/><br/><b>Fear of Gamers</b><br/>Gamers are barely-socialized, rarely-showering, living-with-mom wannabes that will corner you and tell you about their character for two hours, right?  We bristle at the suggestion, sure, but <em>we know they're really out there anyway</em>.  Going out and playing games means (we think) opening ourselves up to attack by cat-piss men.  Luckily, this is not the case -- there are good ways to find good players and avoid bad players -- but it is a powerful discouragement, nonetheless.                        </div>

                            I'm down with Fear of Gamers.  It was a huge leap of faith for me to look for cool new people by pinging folks local to me on the Forge.  It worked out great, but I still fear the cat-piss men in uncontrolled gamer situations.  Maybe I'm damaged, but honestly, I don't want to have anything to do with them, in person or otherwise.                        </div>

<br/>
I agree the value of playtesting, but I think it has to be balanced by reflection. Every one of the best design ideas I've had was created and taken to a working level without any playtesting. Playtesting can polish things, refine them and improve them but it can't form them in the first place. Great Ork Gods is a case in point, all the fundamentals of the game where formed before it ever saw playtesting, playtesting merely refined it.The resolution system in Chanter didn't come from playtesting it came from pie-in-the-sky discussions about roleplaying theory, yet it worked on it's first outing in actual play.<br/>
<br/>
Play without understanding is worthless to design.                        </div>

                            Oh, absolutely. But Playtesting will help you take that idea (which you came up with At The Desk) and put it into practice to see if it stands up or fails, under what kinds of loads (3 players vs 6 players, 2 hr game vs campaign, etc). Sure, playtesting won't give you brand new ideas, but through playtesting, you might be able to see that:<br><br>Your Idea/Scope -------- Which Birthed ---------&gt; A Rule<br><br>Turns out, that rule was crap.

                            Ok, but quite seriously - Has anyone (outside of WOTC) ever done any of this on a scale that could legitimately considered statistically significant?  I'm going to guess not, but I'm willing to be pleasantly surprised.  Given that, our science gets a little dodgy. :)<br/>
<br/>
I'm certainly not saying that the scientific method is not a usable tool in this, but I'm unlikely to concede it's the only, or even the best, tool.  There are other legitimate models of revision in writing, graphic design, painting and even finance and business, and in some ways I'd be more excited to see how those get applied.  The scientific method is an old workhorse, but it is a perhaps too familiar one.<br/>
<br/>
So that said, lemme stand outside of the we in question, and let me also add that Adam, i think you just illustrated my point about the shape of standards-driven design and why it works, whether or not it's for everyone (and possibly about culture too) more effectively than I did.  :)<br/>

                            Maybe I did, Rob. I'm not convinced though.<br/>
<br/>
You can still play games, see people problems, have theories about how to fix them, create a testable hypothesis, then experiment -- and still have people-oriented design. Convince me that people-oriented design works best without the scientific method.<br/>
<br/>
Role-playing games are an odd mixture of engineering, psychology and sociology, technical writing, and theater. The scientific method addresses the first three things pretty well. Other tools need to address the latter two things. I think if you try to address the sociological or the engineering aspects of gaming with models drawn from art, it will produce some interesting and useful results, but they'll be laden with problems.                        </div>

                            Much depends on the order you place those elements - as listed, they're pretty much in descending order of how applicable scientific theory will be.  if you view it as engineering first and foremost, then scientific method becomes a powerful tool, but if you view it as theatre first and foremost, scientific method becomes an interesting afterthought.<br/>
<br/>
This is going to get very rambly, so hang on tight.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there's a definition gap to bridge.  The scientific method can, probably _eventually_ do anything that any other model can (and vice versa) if only through simple persistence.   If you keep trying things you will eventually hit on _something_.  And, frankly, if that's all the standard it needs to be held to then sure, rah rah, go scientific method.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming we're a little bit more demanding, then we can say that the scientific method is fairly, for lack of a better word, methodical.  It's approach is thorough and incremental and it depends on having metrics that can be measured (because without them, any determination of which is a better outcome is just a judgement call, and if that's all we're doing, then cool, but best not call ti scientific).  Now, god knows that we're all big fans of inventing entirely bullshit pseudoscientific metrics and terminology, but people have been paid far more than us to measure whether a game is any fun, and still suck at it.<br/>
<br/>
"But are we measuring fun?" one might ask.  I, naturally, say "Of course we are, what the hell else are we looking for if not that?"  This is hard, of course, because you can't measure fun, and it's hard to codify the way you can certain design goals or even those slices of fun one may peel off, like "engagement" or "energy".  Thing is, ultimately, the standard by which one comes up with those metrics is the same standard by which they are judged, and in terms of pure process, that's dirty pool.<br/>
<br/>
So if the question is instead about something with the trappings of scientific method, but is really just a way to make "my good judgement" sound more authoritative, that's totally cool.  Viva la pseudoscience.<br/>
<br/>
But if you really are sticking to that which can be measured and incremental improvement, the weaknesses should be as obvious as the strengths.  It's harder to discard an entire branch of thought based on gut.  It's hard to throw in an entirely new idea since you can't fairly metric it yet. It can't measure fun, only its shadow.<br/>
<br/>
And here's where we hit the real rub: is this art or science?<br/>
<br/>
It's probably both, depending on who you are and what you're trying to do, but the danger emerges (as it always does) when science says "Can you scientifically prove that art is the better path than science?" (as it does when art asks "That's nice, but is it art?").  If you accept the premises that make scientific method the best possible tool, then every test you run will prove it is so, and again, dirty pool.<br/>
<br/>
So let me change the criteria to something a little more answerable then - how much does a given design _trust_ a given GM, and by trust I mean expect that the GM will take the game and make it his own.<br/>
<br/>
The scientifically proven game is very low trust by its nature because it has _science_.  It's the _best possible game_ for this, at least by all of its own standards.  Given that, the question is whether this _should_ be a standard.<br/>
<br/>
There's an underlying assumption in a lot of games that they're finished. That they should be played according to the text because that is the _best_ way to play them.<br/>
<br/>
And _that_.  That right there.  That is not designing to people.  That is designing to the game. The goal is a great game for people, but it makes no consideration for who those people might be.<br/>
<br/>
So what's the alternative?  Clearly we can't design games to be customized to each individual player. It's simply impossible.  However, every _GM_ has this ability, so the question then becomes "Can we give him the tools to make the very best game _for him and his group_ (with all the potential chance for failure that comes with this)  or do we want to give him the best damn game we can make and remove that chance of failure?"<br/>
<br/>
There is a real difference between those games.  One is sloppy, one is restrictive.  Both work, but does one work better than the other? I dunno, but I'll certainly say that one is more popular locally. :)                        </div>

                            I think the key isn't so much massive playtesting but diverse playtesting. If you managed to get 100 hardcore D&amp;D fans to playtest your game you won't get the results you'd get if you managed 3 D&amp;D fans, 4 Finnish LARPers, your parents and some random people from the break room at work.<br/>

                            Hey Rob, I hear you on this issue:<br/><br/><code>Q: When a game says "When [thing] happens, the GM should use her best judgement to resolve it" does it mean:<br/><br/>A) that the design is sloppy<br/>B) that the author trusts his audience</code><br/>For me, it totally depends on the context.  Right now I'm translating that Tenra Bansho game.  It came across kind of a rethought "Golden Rules" section, where it tells (newbie, primarily) gamers to let the GM decide if the rules don't cover a particular activity.<br/><br/>That's cool.  <br/><br/>The only problem is that I later found rules that were unclarified, didn't have examples, and could cause a total standstill or meltdown for a newbie group. Blah. I asked the designers, though, and got a lot of solid "this is what we do/did when playing" feedback which is going into the game as rules, optional rules, and explanation. That's stuff that could have had a better explanation, which could have been found through tossing the book to a new group of gamers and seeing what they did with it.<br/><br/>I think we'll for the sake of argument let the part slide about "When rules don't explain or cover everything". Not all games need a total currency for all human activity.<br/><br/>Where Adam's comments come into total clarity is with rules that the designer clearly meant to mean/do one thing, but end up doing something else (or having further ripple-effects that are "bad") that weren't noticed because it wasn't playtested enough.<br/><br/>Sometimes it's clear that a game was not playtested enough.  Ex: Eric (Technocrat) has a game he's working on, with some solid mechanics. We playtested two Fridays ago, and will play again this Friday.  Last session was OK, but sucked some: The rules in places clearly didn't do what Eric meant them to do. In another place, one rule fell apart, but he didn't notice it in earlier playtests because in our session we did things that other groups didn't do. If he had published the game before playtesting with us, it would have sucked.  As it is, he found the flaws and was able to re-engineer the rules to be closer to what he intended them to be. And I'm looking forward to it.<br/><br/>Some games don't need a lot of playtesting, because they don't do anything new. They just build on the backbone of What Everyone's Seen Before, like all the "vanilla sim systems" out there: They just have to make sure the points for various abilities seems balanced, and can do that through math without even playtesting.<br/><br/>Other games that do new things, or have rules that are new and are meant to do something specific for that game, require more playtest, as there could be flaws that are only exposed through play with critical groups.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            See, I think this "trust" issue is a straw man. Let's say I totally trust the people for whom I'm designing a game. Let's assume that it's impossible for me (or anyone) to deliver a 100% complete game, and that we have to trust the players to deal with whatever isn't there.<br/>
<br/>
Should I give them a game that is 50% "complete" or 90% "complete"? <br/>
<br/>
Also, you keep mentioning giving players tools to handle things. I don't differentiate between "rules" and "mechanics" and "tools." It's all tools. It's all rules. It's all mechanics. If you intentionally design so that your players must do some design-like work as part of play, that's cool. If you just leave gaps without really thinking about it, that's not cool.                        </div>

                            True enough regarding tools, so replace my references to tools with "general purpose tools" rather than "Specialized/single task" tools.<br/>
<br/>
And sure, nothing is ever 100%, but the question of whether it shoudl be 50% or 90% is less relevant than 85% vs 92%.  In terms of numbers, the 80/20 rule seems to apply here as well as anything else.<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure, whatever else is going into things, 80% of a hypothetical game is gonna be about the same no matter what the priority going in is.  The question is what that 20% is going to look like.  It may not seem like much, but the last mile is always the bitch.  What is done and what is left undone, and which of those decisions were made for thoughtful reasons rather than accident or habit? <br/>
<br/>
That said, there are lots of specific things that can be drilled down on.  Want a simple yardstick?  Look at how _profound_ an impact on a game the decision to go with task based vs effort/scene based resolution has.  Why is that decision made? Is it because it boils any conflict or scene down to its essentials, or is it because it's a shortcut that simplifies things to the point where they are manageable, but less interesting? ;)  Depends who you ask, and, again, depends on priorities.<br/>
<br/>
But that's a whole other kettle of fish.<br/>

If you ask me, I say you give it to them when you have hit that 'wall'.  I've seen plenty of my friends that are designers 'hit a wall'.  They know what they want the game to do, but for whatever reason, it's just not doing it.  And they can't figutre out why.  That's when I think it needs that hot, buttery, different point of view, injection.  <br/>
<br/>
Run what you have for your group of playtesters. Maybe one of them will see what the game needs.  Maybe one of them will say something that causes a spark in your brain and you'll be able to keep moving on with it.  Or maybe you'll realize you need to set all your notes on fire and start the whole thing over.  <br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, if you push and push all you're going to do is give yourself a headache and you'll end up putting it to the side for an indefinite amount of time and nothing will become of your ideas.                        </div>

                            Part of the problem here is that we have this crazy idea in our heads that playtests should be fun.  They shouldn't.  The ideal playtest is miserable, awkward, and painful for all involved.<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
Because the goal of playtests is not to have fun.  The goal of playtests is to find problems with the system.  If you have fun, you're likely to overlook problems -&gt; failed playtest.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, it is best to start playtest as soon as your game is at all possible to play.  I take Shreyas's IRC Torchbearer playtest -- where the game broke down completely before the first conflict even finished -- as an ideal.  Why?  Because it gave him a clear idea about what needed to be done with the game.  Miserable game, good playtest.<br/>
<br/>
Whereas my recent Bliss Stage playtest was fun, and confirmed that I'm doing some things right, but didn't light a huge fire under me about what needs fixin'.  I've got one or two bits out of it, but that's it.  Good game, so-so playtest.<br/>

If your playtest group like picking crap apart together and suggesting other ways to do things that don't go well on the fly, it can be fun - just, not the same kind of fun.                        </div>

                            Amen, Ben. Biggest problems I've run into in testing have come from trying to keep it fun, and the best sessions I've had came when I just said "screw it" and just threw in ninjas and new rules.<br/>
<br/>
Not that the productive sessions weren't fun to _play_, but by absolving myself of the responsibility to entertain, I was much more free to abuse the system.<br/>

                            Ben, I can't say I totally agree. Both fun and un-fun playtests show you different things about the system. Obviously, un-fun playtests highlight problems. But fun playtests show you what's working or how to make the game work---which isn't always obvious.<br/><br/>I had a couple of un-fun playtests with tMW, which showed things that were problems. But I had this one playtest that went surprisingly well that showed me tons about the proper way to GM the game. I learned more that day than with any other playtest.<br/><br/>If your mechanics or whatever are broken, making the game un-fun, you'll never get passed them to the point where you can focus on informal techniques, which can be crucial to the proper functioning of a game.                        </div>
