I know people who dislike BDtP because it breaks the usual "flow" of TSOY by forcing the intentions on people, which some feel as a straightjacket to what can happen in-game.<br/><br/>So, in the thread mentioned above, couldn't the shouting-down-storms and stuff be handled as complex actions where one collects bonus dice for a simple ability check? That should allow for the same amount of in-game to-and-fro, without the hassle of BDtP, where you're forced to passive actions to change your intentions, which draws out BDtP (unneccessary). Or is it just a matter of people not setting their priorities (-&gt; "intentions") correctly, and forgetting that it's important to give early, give often?<br/><br/><br/>PS: Personally, I'm fine with BDtP as is (with a fix for group conflicts provided by the finnish translation), but as I want to convince people, I'm looking for supporting arguments.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64690/#Comment_64690" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-23T04:42:34+00:00" title="April 23, 2007  4:42AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a group we still struggle with giving in BDTP, although we're getting better.

There aren't any rules changes, per se; things are explained using different terminology, and different aspects of how it all works together are emphasized.  Same system, same basic execution, looked at from an angle that's rotated 134 degrees on the horizontal plane and 32 degrees on the vertical: in cliched terms, it's just a different way of looking at it.<br/><br/>My impression comes from the fact that I've run a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">six-</span> seven-character BDtP very recently in which, during a given round, there were never less than three different goals amongst the participants, and only <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">two</span> three characters didn't change their intent during the whole conflict (largely because they didn't <i>realize</i> that the other Goals were present until after it was too late to do anything about it, and they'd been abandoned or become irrelevant) -- during that conflict, using only the English version of the rules and applying them logically, we did <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exactly</span> what Eero's version implies.<br/><br/>Which isn't to say I don't <i>like</i> Eero's version/wording -- I think his phrasing might be clearer to some of my players, though we all seem to get it already.<br/><br/>The on-topic bit:<br/>I'm entirely in agreement with Jason on this: in my experience, BDtP doesn't happen so often as to drag down play, and when the player's call for it, it gives the scene more weight and electricity and (as one player put it) "mechanical heft."  Generally lasting Harm is enough of a pain in the ass that people seriously consider whether they want to stay in, everytime they take a hit, and have clear opinions on when it's 'too much.'  Then again, I set smallish stakes when I can.<br/><br/>First edition BDtP used to be a not-often-fun PitA -- BDtP in the 2nd edition is not significantly more complicated than simple conflicts where people are rolling 'secondary' skill rolls for bonus die -- we're still driving along at the same rate, we're just using more of the gears, because the road got all curvy.<br/><br/>But the curvy roads are the fun bits anyway, right?  Provided the WHOLE ROAD isn't curvy -- that's tedious. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(Yeah, I like that analogy. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64701/#Comment_64701" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-23T07:15:56+00:00" title="April 23, 2007  7:15AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Doyce.<br/><br/>I sense no offtopicness in your opening comment: If Eero is saying the same thing as Clinton did, so much for the better. IMHO there is a subtle difference in the way group efforts are handled (which is the 'fixing' thing I mentioned), which solves a cognitive problem for a number of people I know (that aren't native english speakers - maybe it's just the conciseness of Clinton's wording plus a sample conflict that partially follows the old rules?), namely that the one unskilled character that does the final ability test can spoil the efforts of an arbitrary number of grand masters. Also, the group members are not limited to helping or standing around, and can defend the group as a whole against other attacks as well.<br/><br/>So, is it right to say that SGs should set stakes in a way that BDtP does dominate a session if  the characters want to get anything done, but should rather build up tension for highlights (that best work used sparingly)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64706/#Comment_64706" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-23T07:47:25+00:00" title="April 23, 2007  7:47AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2007 7:49AM by Doyce.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: oliof</cite>Hey Doyce.<br/><br/>Also, the group members are not limited to helping or standing around, and can defend the group as a whole against other attacks as well.</blockquote>\nI see your point about explicitly mentioning/allowing/advocating that as an option for people in a group BDtP -- it's helpful to specifically state that for everyone.\n<blockquote><br/>So, is it right to say that SGs should set stakes in a way that BDtP does dominate a session if  the characters want to get anything done, but should rather build up tension for highlights (that best work used sparingly)?</blockquote>\nI think that declaring the Goals for Bringing Down the Pain is very much like Dogs in the Vineyard conflict -- setting up smaller, more-giveable Intents/Goals from the NPCs and encouraging the same from the PCs means that BDtP doesn't always have to go down to the bitter end -- usually won't, in fact.<br/><br/>In my head, as the GM, I'm trying to set goals for the NPCs that "balance out" against Harm in an even way -- where it's up to the player to decide which result (Harm, vs the NPCs goal) is worse... and the answer isn't immediately CLEAR to anyone.<br/><br/>If the answer IS immediately clear, I either set the stakes too high, or set them too low. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64708/#Comment_64708" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-23T07:55:09+00:00" title="April 23, 2007  7:55AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Uh ... how quickly do you people <i>heal</i> your characters, anyway?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I try for two BDtP sessions in one game then my character usually comes out looking like <b>hamburger</b>, even if I win both of them handily.

That means that all damage collapses into the low end of the harm tracker. As an example, if you had checks at 2, 3, and 6 on the harm tracker, they'd collapse to 1, 2, and 3 after Bringing Down the Pain. This applies even to harm from before Bringing Down the Pain, so feel free to get in a nasty scrape if you're hurt.</blockquote> and <blockquote>When you're physically tore up, get in an argument and Bring Down the Pain. If you've been socially massacred, get in a fight and Bring Down the Pain. Harm shakes out afterwards. A tussle's good for the soul.</blockquote>(Thank you, Creative Commons!)<br/><br/>These imply, to me, that "after BDtP" implies the whole conflict, not the initiation. Like, if you went into BDtP and immediately took a level 6 wound and backed out, you'd end up with a level 1 wound right after the group figured out how the conflict went. Which also means that you have to keep any harm already built up at its current level until an entire conflict -- which is why CRN advises us to go for a conflict in an area where you haven't build up penalty dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64937/#Comment_64937" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T08:21:00+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  8:21AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2007 8:21AM by Doyce.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite><cite>Posted By: Doyce</cite>Afterwards it shakes out to three bruised results.</blockquote>Uh ...

They can take out the big baddie in one (successful) hit if they want to without going to BDTP.  They are told that the GM doesn't have to kill off that baddie; they can escape, "come back", etc.<br/><br/>However, some folks interpret that to mean "the big baddie can ONLY be shut down with BDTP". That's not the case.<br/><br/>The GM basically has that "ability" to bring back baddies if BDTP isn't used, as a stopgap measure to make sure that the players don't just buffer up their ability into one big blow and take out every baddie with the intention, "My Intention is that "I kill him"! Gimmie all your gift dice!  Hooo, I succeed! Another baddie dead!!!"  The GM has the right to bring those guys back.<br/><br/>But the GM doesn't HAVE to bring them back. And just cause the players don't use BDTP doesn't mean that the big baddie ISN'T put down for good in that one blow (physical or social).  Sometimes, the GM is totally fine with that, and it works out better/cooler for everyone to finish the big baddie with that one hit.  But the GM, if dissatisfied with the outcome, has the ability to bring that dude back at a later time.

Things were just chugging along too quickly for anything but plot movement.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that said, we only had one BDTP that I recall (and it was pretty much near the end). Perhaps if people had gotten more battered up, they would have called for more refreshment. But this wasn't even a particularly "Gritty" game - just Malador. Just situationally compelling. As it was, we had burned through our pools pretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider that a GMing goal, when playing TSOY. Can you get folks down to the point where they're pushing on, even though they're pretty badly hurt? Can you get a BDTP to happen where players have their characters go in hurt? And come out really bad off? If you can, then you've provided players with some really compelling stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake them want to risk their resources, and even their characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65773/#Comment_65773" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-27T12:05:35+00:00" title="April 27, 2007 12:05PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or, start having normal Conflicts come with Harm, based on the Success Level.

Ther result is that the character either looks very cool in defeating a tough opponent, and probably blows some resources to do so, or they now have to make the decision to BDTP (with it's attendant consequences). By doing this, you can constantly be draining resources from the players, which makes the decisions more and more pressured as time goes on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go easy on the characters, then the pressure rarely builds.

Nonetheless, I quote the second paragraph of the rules regarding BDtP (emphasis mine):\n<blockquote><br>Any player involved in a conflict can Bring Down the Pain after a resisted ability check. Normally, a player has to abide by the results of this check. However, when a character belonging to a player - a player that is not the Story Guide - loses at a resisted ability check, that player does not have to accept the outcome. Instead, she can ask that the Pain be Brought Down. On the flip side, a player can demand this even when she succeeds at a resisted ability check.<br>This not only allows her to zoom in the imagined camera on this conflict, but <b>is the only way to permanently injure or get rid of a major named character controlled by the Story Guide.</b><br/></br></br></blockquote>\nYou seem to say "this paragraph doesn't explicitly mention 'unless the SG is OK with permanent injury or removal of a major named character without resorting to BDtP', which a lot of people misinterpret as 'the SGCs have special protection from permanent effects outside BDtP'". <br><br>Thinking about this for half a minute from a "by-the-book" view point yields the following conclusion: Even without the explicit wording the SG could end BDtP in the first open phase with "OK, I give, he's dead, Jane."<br><br>So, if I got it right, please say so, if I am totally off the tracks, please say so too. Thanks in any case!<br><br>PS: In the course of development of TCGs, someone developed the idea of an un-rule: Since tapping was one of the major mechanical things in Magic: The Gathering, other TCG rules had to explicitly state that you don't have to tap the cards for an effect if that was the case \xe2\u20ac\u201c an absence of untapping rules was not enough to pass playtest without problems. Maybe this is a similar case where the "un-rule" of SG-approved BDtP-less permanent injury/removal of SGCs could be added to clarify the issue?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65797/#Comment_65797" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-27T12:58:34+00:00" title="April 27, 2007 12:58PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Un-rule.

I've read but not played TSoY, so I have no deep extertise here, but. . .seems to me that there's actually NO WAY for the permanence of an adversary's defeat to <i>not</i> be at the ultimate discretion of the SG. I mean, it's one thing if a specific rule says "in this circumstance an NPC is dead dead <i>dead</i>, and brining them back is cheating." But going the other direction, it's entirely up to the SG to decide whether to bring a character back. All he has to do to maintain permanence is simply not use that character after their defeat. In a way there's really no difference in the long run between these two scenarios:<br><br>A) "You run his sword through his heart and he falls dead at your feet.
