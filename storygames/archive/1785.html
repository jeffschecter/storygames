                    First off, I am not from Seattle. I live in phoenix.<br/>
<br/>
However I will be moving to seattle around april of 08.<br/>
<br/>
I am a big gamer, having been gaming for close to 20 years off and on.<br/>
<br/>
Lately I have been into alot of the small press or Indie Press games<br/>
like Dogst in the Vineyard, Dont Rest Your Head, Little Fears,<br/>
Polaris. But I have a solid grounding in the more traditional games,<br/>
D20, Rifts, WW, etc. etc.<br/>
<br/>
I would list my current favorite games as Ravenloft, Shadowrun, and<br/>
PrimeTime Adventures.<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone like to talk on email? maybe get an IRC or Play By Post<br/>
game started? I would love to have some built in gamer friends when I<br/>
move up to seattle.<br/>
<br/>
Thanx<br/>
<br/>
