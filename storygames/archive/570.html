<p>No, I'm not talking about any social-contract dreck like "By becoming a more skilled GM" or "By earning the trust of the players."  Damned hippies.</p>
<p>In many games, as I'm playing, my character becomes a more effective instrument of my righteous awesomeness.  My fledgling little 1st level mage becomes an unstoppable 20th level juggernaut of mystic might.  He becomes a better tool for me to do the things I want to do.  I, as a player, make this happen.  It is my reward for being cool, and it draws me forward.</p>
<p>I know of <strong>no</strong> games where the GM is similarly rewarded.  Where are the mechanics that will let me advance my world from one where the biggest real threat is a band of goblins (and everything else is "far away") to one where elder dragons flap in to have tea and subtly threaten genocide against the mud-races?</p>
<p>Why must the poor GM, selfless martyr that she is, be deprived of the simple pleasure of advancement?</p>

                            Basic D&amp;D.  As you advanced from the Red Box to the Blue Box to the next box (never got that far), the DM would get to play with bigger monsters, traps, and different settings (the Red Box only had rules in it for dungeons, with the Blue Box you got rules for the wilderness).                        </div>

<p>Hiya Tony!</p>
<p>D&amp;D <em>totally</em> has advancement for the DM.  The DM get's to move from small creatures to large creatures by <em>loosing</em> confliccts.  The more conflicts (battles) the DM looses, the more powerful the PCs, the more powerful the PCs, the more powerful the monsters the DM is allowed to bring into the game.</p>

                            I was going to say D&amp;D, but someone beat me to it. Even without the boxes playing "by the rules" for ECL still keeps the levels of challange faced by the PCs in scope. <br/><br/>The thing about D&amp;D though is that it's an odd beast for DM advancement. You have to advance the players in order to be able to advance yourself, and as you're supposed to be running opposition for the players, it can lead to an odd tangle. <br/><br/>I know that back in the way back machine, I used to give players way, way too much gold and Xp because I wanted to rush them through the booring part of the box -- I'd already fidgeted about with all the current encounters and monsters (even if the players had never gotten to them) -- and I wanted to get them to the level where they could fight the next cluster of enemies. So I'd cheat them out of their ability to step on up by Monte Halling everything, giving them toss over challanges that would skyrocket their Xp, and then rushing them into the next cool thing. <br/><br/>Hmm. How about Rune? I've never actually played it, but doesn't it have something where the GM is contrained, but as the group advances the resources avaliable to the GM advance as well?                        </div>

                            I did the same thing, Brand; especially with new characters. Because the notion that characters had to advance in-game was very strong (this was Das Schwarze Auge, btw), we made shit up like, here, have a mirror, there's a Basilisk over there, yay, 5 levels gain! And all legit (sort of).<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays I'd just start characters at higher levels. Then they can step on up at that point without us wasting time.<br/>
<br/>
But yes, that's the way the GM "advances". And it's not odd that the GM has to lose to advance. The opposite would be a death spiral. The person whose job it is to provide challenges has to make them appropriately beatable. It's not the other players' job to provide a challenge to the GM. That's just the way a GM-led Gamist system works.                        </div>

<p>And, now I think of it ... how <em>whacked</em> is the way I even <em>said</em> that?</p>
<p>"The GM <em>could</em> throw elder dragons at a first level party" when what I ought to be saying is "The GM <em>could</em> throw elder dragons around in a first-level world."</p>
<p>I'm unconsciously assuming the dynamic where the GM advances only when the PCs advance, because the GM has no independent ability to advance on his own.  That's screwy, man.</p>
<p>Imagine a D&amp;D game where you know, <strong>know</strong>, that the GM is going to advance from goblins up through Ogres to fucking arch-liches step by step based on how well he can hose you ... and that if you back down, if you don't smack him around, you're going to be a tenth-level party facing fifteenth level enemies, and you will be up shit creek, because you didn't keep up with the GM's advancement by advancing your characters.</p>
<p>Imagine, likewise, a D&amp;D game with the same rules where the players outdo the GM, and so they're cooler than their opposition.</p>
<p>Those would fuckin' <em>rawk</em>.  Why the hell don't we do that?</p>

                            I'm not sure the GM <i>should</i>. Seriously, but it might deserve some explaining.<br/><br/>If the GM's job is to create adversity for the players (I know this is making assumptions about the GM's role in a particular game), then some sort of mechanical balance between the GM and the players seems logical. Acheiving mechanical balance is extremely difficult, especially if individuals advance independently of one another.<br/><br/>It would seem easier to tie the one of the sides' power to the other, and since players are stuck on <i>their</i> character's advancement, that means it would seem easier to tie the GM's power to that of the players'. Off the top of my head, both PTA and Raven's <i>Orx</i> are games that tie the GM's power to the player's power.                        </div>

Why? Because it would create a power spiral. If you lose the first couple of conflicts, then you're screwed.                        </div>

<p>Huh?  It seems totally easy to me.  You use negative feedback.  Make people advance more quickly (<em>cetera paribus</em>) when they are the underdog.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>EDIT:  Yes, D&amp;D would have a positive feedback cycle.  The more powerful you are, the more you can pursue more power.  Like sticking your microphone in front of a speaker this could create a death spiral of painful feedback.  But that's just one way to arrange rewards vs. current-power-levels.  If it becomes easier to pursue more power when you are relatively weak then the problem is self-correcting.</p>

                            Tony, <br/><br/>It isn't hardcoded, no. It's strongly suggested, but there isn't any mechanical enforcement that I can find by skimming the ECL sections of the DMG atm. (Though I do seem to remember at least some d20 books having notations that if you through encounters above a certain level at players you are effectivly just killing their characters, which you shouldn't do. But still, its a "shouldn't" not a "you can't.") <br/><br/>Also, would the underdogs thing work for the GM to? Because that could create an interesting dynamic where when you get on top you want to remake as much of the world as you can, as lastingly as you can, before the other side regains advantage. When the PCs are up they want to use their power to create institutions and alliances and do the forces of good a lasting favor. When the GM is up he wants to work to ruin everything good in the world -- because thats the way to gain lasting impact when the currency of power can flow up and down with time and tide.                        </div>

                            In my opinion, the GM's role is to create a world for the players, or a story, or motivation.  So it seems the GM is already above and beyond the players, knowing more, having more things at his/her disposal, etc.  As GM you are a god; how do you get better than that?<br/>

                            Nancy, <br/><br/>By playing games in which the GM isn't god. <br/><br/>If the GM is facing limits as stern and unflexible as the PCs do (or more so) then suddenly the whole balance of power shifts. Once you can say to the GM, as a player, "No, you cannot do that, you must do this" then the whole idea that the GM has unlimited powers goes away like mist in the sunlight. <br/><br/>So if you have a limited GM, and limited players, and the players get to get cooler, then doesn't it make sense that in that kind of setup, the GM should be able to get cooler as well?                        </div>

<p>Sure.  Sounds good.  I like the dynamic you're talking about there ... especially since it makes room for tactics like <em>stalling</em>.</p>

Now you want to oust the corrupt barons and reinvigorate the order of knighthood, before the pendulum swings back and I (as GM) get the resources to raise an army of undead dragons.

                            Oh! I hadn't even considered stalling! That's brilliant! <br/><br/>It also helps replicate a certain rythem in many heroic stories in which the heroes climb the mountain, then stand there uncertain what to do until everything falls apart and then they climb the mountain again. That's damn hard to do in a lot of games, in which you want to constantly up your power, control, and coolness of your character -- but if you have mechanical reason to stall out your own advancement...<br/><br/>I like this idea more every second.                        </div>

                            Another game to consider is Xcrawl.  It's a D20 implementation that shifts the context of the game; the "adventurers" are a team of competitors in a dystopic future arena sport with roots in pro wrestling.  The dungeon master is a character, who has a budget for the monsters and traps and such that he puts in the maze.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you can ALSO play outside the arena, dealing with managers, mafiosi, rival teams, and the like.  I never picked it up (I have a policy of not buying expensive games unless I have concrete plans to get my money's worth) but it takes some of the power out of the dungeon master's hands, to put unlimited obstacles in the way of the PC's.                        </div>

I have rules for GM advancement in The Holmes and Watson Committee.  Admittedly, the GM advances only as the players advance the plot.  But it's an early attempt by me to the GM resources similar to the kinds of resources players have.<br/>

<blockquote>Huh? It seems totally easy to me. You use negative feedback. Make people advance more quickly (cetera paribus) when they are the underdog.</blockquote>
Is it really that easy? I had a homebrew that did that, and we still ended with a power imbalance between players. It tended to spiral. One or two players would gain an advantage over the others, at which you ended up with one of two situations---either you had tough enemies that challenge the better characters, and the lower characters couldn't compete effectively, or you had easy enemies that the better characters just mopped up on. We ended up having to balance thru the Social Contract, everyone had to agree to cooperate so that everyone would stay more or less at the same level.<br/><br/>Now, I'm sure there's a better way to do it then I did back when, but all I'm saying is it's not neccessarily that easy.                        </div>

I forget) which is suppose to be the player's levels or something. In other words, the monsters are suppose to be tied to the character's levels.

                            Brand and John Harper both mentioned <b>Rune</b> -- but for those who aren't familiar with it.  <br/><br/><b>Rune</b> is a 2001 game by Robin Laws, a game of fantasy Viking action based on the computer game from Human Head Studios.  Both players and "runners" (i.e. the person running a given encounter) gain victory points.  But Runners don't get Victory points purely for beating the heroes.  They get victory points for: <ul><li> "Almost Down, But Not Quite Out" <br/> Taking a hero almost entirely down without killing them.  </li> <li> "Chortle at the Misfortunes of Others" <br/> Player failures at specific rolls. </li> <li> "When Terrain comes into Play" <br/> When terrain or traps get used either way in a fight (max of four times for 80 points). </li> <li> "Proxy Score" <br/> Half points for the runner's own PC score (controlled by another player during the encounter) </li> </ul>
Note that the runner is the person controlling the scenario, which could be pre-packaged or designed by someone else.  If he's also the designer and he got points from each of the other categories, then he gets an extra bonus.  So the runner gets blackjack points of a sort.  He wants to heavily wound but not kill the heroes, and wants to drag in terrain up to four times.                        </div>

I know that the default method is that the role of runner/GM switches rotates among the group between encounters/scenerios/whatever. Can Victory points be used to boost your character or the environment?                        </div>

I don't recall completely the thread on the Forge, but I believe that as the player's clan advanced the GM got more points or something like that.                        </div>

                            Bear in mind that I haven't played it either, so take what I say with a grain of salt.  But I've got my copy on the shelf by me at the moment, so...<br/>
<br/>
Victory points can only be spent to increase your own character's abilities.  However, when a majority of the group of players passes certain thresholds of total victory points, then the designer gets extra points to build encounters with.  <br/>
<br/>
Note that you yourself get victory points by running an encounter.  So increasing your victory points helps increase the number of encounter build points you'll get next time -- but you have to get a little under half the other players to cross the threshold with you.  <br/>
<br/>
For example, suppose there are five players.  I'm GM/"runner" for this encounter.  If me and two other players all pass 500 total victory points in this encounter, then for my next encounter I'll get 50 more encounter points.                        </div>

                            Related to this: games where players give the GM a budget, but the reward they can get is directly tied to that budget as well.

<blockquote>See, I'm still confused how that spiralled. A group of two 5th level characters and 2 2nd level characters take down a 3rd level monster. How many XPs (just ballpark numbers, mind) do the 5th levels get? How many XPs do the 2nd level get?</blockquote>
The issue was it wouldn't 4 players against just 1 monster, there would likely be 3 4rd lvl monsters, 3 5th lvl monsters and maybe 1 7th lvl monster. The players would get a general amount of Exp for participating, but then they would gain extra depending on their actions. There also may have been some sort of bonus for "going it alone" against a monster, I don't quite remember (we played a bunch of homebrews back then).<br/><br/>An added issue was that a 5th lvl hero had no problem standing up against a 5th lvl monster. But if a 2nd lvl hero went up against the same 5th lvl hero, he risked getting taken out by one or two hits. So what ended up happening was that the weaker players concentrated on weaker enemies and never really got a chance to catch up. <br/><br/>Like I said, I'm sure there's a better way to do this, but it's not neccessarily that easy.                        </div>

<p>Okay, I was trying to whisper this, but that's tricky to notice on this board.  Anyway ....</p>
<p><code>The players would get a general amount of Exp for participating, but then they would gain extra depending on their actions. There also may have been some sort of bonus for "going it alone" against a monster, I don't quite remember (we played a bunch of homebrews back then).</code></p>
<p>Okay, you are describing absolutely <strong>classic</strong> positive feedback here.  A 2nd level fighter is going to get the general amount of XP and nothing else.  If he tries for something more (and particularly for "going it alone" bonusses) he dies.  So, because he's the underdog, he gets the bare minimum of resources.  This tends to make him more the underdog as time goes on.</p>
<p>Likewise, the 5th level person gets the bare minimum, <em>plus</em> achievement, <em>plus</em> going it alone.  He skyrockets away.  Again, very characteristic of positive feedback.</p>
<p>Consider, by comparison, this sort of system:  Everybody gets XPs for every monster killed by the party ... doesn't matter who killed it.  You was there.  You get <strong>nothing</strong> for anything less than your level killed by the party.  You get 100 points for any monster of your level killed by the party, 200 for your level +1, 400 for your level +2, etc., etc.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>So, your players go against 3 4th level monsters, 3 5th and 1 7th.<br/>
  Your 5th level characters get (3 x 0) + (3 x 100) + (1 x 400) = 700 XPs.<br/>
  Your 2nd level characters get (3 * 400) + (3 * 800) + (1 * 3200) = 6800 XPs.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>That way, the underdogs actually get rewarded more than the powerful.  With those numbers, it doesn't take very long (at all!) before everybody's very, very close to the same levels again.  That's negative feedback in action.</p>

D&amp;D ends up being more complicated than it needs to be by both giving lower level PCs more XP for the same monsters, and requiring less XP to gain a level.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

<p>Anyway, you can apply negative feedback techniques to the question of maintaining balance between two parties who are in competition.  I like the idea, frankly, in terms of GM vs. player adversity.  It does interesting and good things to pacing, as Brand and I were chatting about up above.</p>

<p><code>Actually, in what games are the players rewarded? In most that I know of, the characters are rewarded, not the players.</code></p>
<p>Suppose you're playing a character who is a knight in a D&amp;D world.  You do a mission, and your king rewards the character by taking away his old sword and giving him a new, better, magic one.</p>
<p>But ... the game has also just rewarded the player by taking away your old character and giving you a new, better, more effective one.</p>
<p>So what games reward the players?  To my mind, all of them.</p>

                            Well, most games in general don't reward the player.  I guess exceptions would be poker and other gambling games, or Magic: The Gathering where you win cards that are staked.  But usually rewards are only to tokens within the game.  <br/>
<br/>
However, as Jack notes, a traditional GM has unlimited tokens.  You have to change the original, unrewarded GM position in order for rewards to game tokens to mean something to a GM.  So, I'm inclined to think that the answer is either to change the original position, or change the nature of the rewards.                        </div>

                            Hey Tony, does this count re: what you're thinking in terms of advancement?<br/>
<br/>
Suppose players have a resource they spend on stuff, like your basic spendable XP. When they spend like 20 points cumulative on things, the GM is then allowed to implement a new rule, or to release special monsters, or unleash a special adversity upon the players. At 40, the GM gets another neat thing to do, and so on.                        </div>

                            As for the GM being rewarded - you can't say that 'gaining access' to the higher CRs in D&amp;D is a reward for being a DM - he has access to those at any time, and could, in theory if not in reality, deploy them.  Asshattery aside, that means that the progression of the DM is determined in large amount by the ability of the players, not their own ability.<br/><br/>In my old group, we rotated DM responsibility, and at the end of the DM's term secret scores were assigned based on how good you thought the DM did (any player-based problems aside).  The scores were aggregated, high and low dropped, and the resulting number was multiplied by 100 or something and that could be turned into experience or loot.  Then the DM's character was reintroduced (along with a snazzy story hook) back into the group narrative as the next DM took over.<br/><br/>Mind you, this requires that you have rotating (or at least shift-work) DMing, which I advocate anyways.                        </div>

                            For some time back I had some thoughts about GM reward, where I wanted to reward the GM for using character flags. But every thing I tried seemed to turn the game into a direction I did not want it to.<br/><br/>GM reward can properly work very well in competitive games like D&amp;D, but it is hard for me to see how it can work in games that focus on stories and social conflicts. The problem is, before you can reward the GM you have to limit the GM, and it seems strange to me to limit what a GM can do with the story.<br/><br/> - Anders                        </div>

<p>Okay, this is wandering into very negative territory (thanks largely to YOU, Jack ... sheesh ... "because it was boring" ... Mr. Helpful).  I'd like to focus it down a little and see if we can go from theoretical agreement that this <em>could</em> work to talking about the craft of how it <em>would</em> work.</p>
<p>So ... advancement in many games is by increasing the player's power to impact the game.  The player's power to impact the game is a bundle of things which are often called "the character."</p>
<p>This is totally <em>not</em> a representation of one person and their abilities.  That's a historical artifact that colors people's perception to the point where they say downright <em>stupid</em> things like "Well, the strength of the world-wide Templar Order is a character ability of Sir Frederick," when any sensible person would say "Uh ... aren't there a few more people in the Templar Order than just Sir Frederick?"</p>
<p>I got no problem with that.  There's no dysfunction that I can detect.  People want to (a) give players vast powers to effect the story ("Templar Order") and (b) anthropomorphize those powers into the shape of one particular avatar ("Sir Frederick").  They seem to achieve both goals with no more than a small mental sleight of hand, and I think that's cool.</p>
<p>But it does put us in a sort of strange position when we try to visualize the bundle of things that represent the <strong>GM's</strong> input and control over the game.  We don't (usually) have a handy face to slap over that bundle to anthropomorphize it ... and so a lot of our ideas of advancement get left out in the cold.</p>
<p>So:  can <em>the world</em> advance as a bundle of narrative levers?  Can the GM be given progressively more powers as his bundle of levers increases?</p>
<p>And, also, what kind of choices would she face along the way?  If I'm advancing my Mage, I make some decisions:  do I seek out magic items in ancient tombs (making a gadget-laden James-Bond-esque mage?) or do I spend time at the books (making a potent scholar with access to many personal spells) or do I branch into some sort of specialty path (illusionist, necromancer, multi-class)?  All of these result in <em>different</em> bundles of narrative levers for me down the road.</p>
<p>If I'm a GM, advancing my World ... do I establish relationship maps between the principals, or do I bulk up on threats and adversity, or do I branch off into some specialty path (political intrigue, epic destiny, comedy)?  All of these could (with the right system support) result in different bundles of narrative levers for me down the road.</p>

                            If you define the GM's narrative levers that way (and there's nothing wrong with that inherently) then what happens to all the levers that are unassigned?<br/>
<br/>
What happens when a PC says, "I'm going down to the docks and hire a ship to the Western Isles."<br/>
<br/>
It's entirely reasonable for him to do that... but the GM has nothing in his toolbox that can reasonably be used to provide opposition for the PC's trip to the Western Isles.<br/>

                            Hmm, could you structure things so the longer the players remain in an area defined by the GM, the more points the GM gets for defining that area. If a player goes off somewhere new, the GM gets points to define the new area, but not as many. There should be some tradeoff for the player also.<br/>
<br/>
If you structured the system right, there would be an incentive for the GM to keep making the areas that already exist interesting to the players, but there would still be room for expansion (either player driven or GM driven).<br/>
<br/>
As a side note - the GM should be rewarded for making the PCs look cool. In a gamist game, this means setting appropriate challenge. For a simulationist game, it means helping them dream and validating their dreams, for narativist play is means helping the players address premise. But play as a whole should make the GM look cool, well all the players.<br/>

                            Tony, have you looked at my game-in-playtest Agora yet?  In it, each scene rotates who is running the opposition (eg "the GM") but whatever they run as the obstacle for that scene then gets put into the "obstacle library".  Later GMs can either create a new obstacle or pull an old one out of the library.  Reintroducing an old obstacle is almost always the more powerful option for the three or four times.  Which is all, like, tangential to what you're talking about.  <em>But!</em><br/><br/>Imagine a GMed game with structured situation creation and a similar library of reusable world details.  The GM has to start with a relatively simple situation based on his budget -- the Masked Marauder is destroying the city.  In the next situation, he uses his budget for a new nemesis, the Crimson Rake, but since he reuses the city setting or reuses an NPC that one of the PCs got the hots for last situation, he can invest more points in the Rake.  Then in the next situation, he can reuse even more stuff, and his budget stretches even further.  He might even, in situation four, bring his three former baddies back as the Superteam of Ultimate Evil Badassery.  The budget for each situation doesn't even have to grow if the GM has access to bits of setting that he's used before.                        </div>

<p><code>It's entirely reasonable for him to do that... but the GM has nothing in his toolbox that can reasonably be used to provide opposition for the PC's trip to the Western Isles.  ... What happens then?</code></p>
<p>Sorta depends on what type of GM they're facing, doesn't it?</p>
<ul>
<li>Political specialist:  Oooh, sorry, it looks like people in court have a vested interest in keeping you around (or, alternately, a vested interest in your delivering <em>their</em> message to the Western Isles rather than your own).  The easy way to deal with this is to politick with whoever has <em>de facto</em> control of the docks, because otherwise you're going to be tied up in red tape until doomsday.</li>
<li>If you've got a good relationship map, the question becomes "Who stows away on your ship with you?"  What sort of little microcosm of the world do you make, depending on which people you stick on that ship and how you bump them together?</li>
<li>If you've bulked up on resources for making monsters and adversity then you're talking sea serpents and storms, ship-wrack and difficulty.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of those are perfectly legitimate ways to apply the GM's narrative levers to the question of taking a boat to the Western Isles, yes?  Does that answer your question, or have I (perhaps) misunderstood what you're asking?</p>

                            Alright, I'm replying mainly to the original post rather than the discussion that followed, because man you guys type fast, but:
<blockquote>Where are the mechanics that will let me advance my world from one where the biggest real threat is a band of goblins (and everything else is "far away") to one where elder dragons flap in to have tea and subtly threaten genocide against the mud-races?</blockquote>
Tony, do you know the "Scale" mechanic in Trollbabe? At the start of the game, it's set at "personal" or "small group" level - gradually it rises through "village" to "army" to "kingdom" to "world".  On the surface, it might <i>look</i> like a measurement of PC power, but really the Scale mechanic determines what Stakes the GM can set for each story, and what opposition she can throw at her players, and what changes the story can make to the world. And the players decide when to increase the stakes, so it's like a reward they give the GM - just like all the player advancements that are handed out by GMs.                        </div>

<p>You're right.  I hate it.  We <em>discussed</em> this exact issue, way up-thread.  Question's been raised and addressed.  Look for timfire's concerns, and a few fun posts about the applications of negative feedback.</p>
<p>But mostly I'm wondering why you keep posting in this thread at all.  You think it's a pointless discussion and we're wasting our time?  That's cool.  How does that impact you in any way?</p>

                            Tony, no, you're missing the point.  The "Western Isles" was a metaphor for whatever area of play the GM didn't have explicit resources available to cover.<br/>
<br/>
The way ...in Spaaace! handles it, is that if the PC's short-circuit an obstacle and Just Go Somewhere Else, the GM gets to "cash in" the obstacles that have been obviated by the PC's, and use those points to buy NEW obstacles that get in their way in the new direction they've taken.                        </div>

<p>Uh ... yeah.  I'm with JBR (as I so often am).  You're <em>creating</em> the problem there, by tying the GMs resources to one area of geography, aren't you?</p>
<p>It's sort of like "How do you deal with the problem of a scene where the player's character isn't present?"  Big deal in Vampire.  Not so big in PTA.  The difference there is (at least in part) how tightly the player's ability to influence the game is tied to their character.</p>

                            Hi!<br/>
  This is just my two cents, but I think the road to success as a GM is to become invested in the Player's Characters. So, when the group succeeds, you succeed.<br/>
  I know that some GMs take an adversarial role and other GMs take the role of a referee and still others are some kind of independant film directors. But, I feel like the successful ones take an interest in the characters and are invested in their success. Consequently, when the characters advance, everyone is happy. That's not to say that conflict, opposition and danger are not to be used, that would be just as boring for the GM as for the player if there were no exciting events. But, that in the back of their mind, the GM is rooting for the players, you know?<br/>

                            Wow . . . I'm reading this discussion, and realizing that it has little-to-nothing to do with the way that I play, so I hope that what I'm posting here is still relevant.<br/><br/>I'm a freeformer at heart, so I tend to toss mechanics around at the drop of a hat.  This means that mechanical methods of GM limitation don't appeal to me all that much.  I don't really want points, or rules, or cards - not as a player and not as a GM.<br/><br/>What I do want is the ability to shout "HARDCORE!"<br/><br/>This is a pretty freeform social mechanic that we've developed in our group.  Basically, most of the time we agree to bounce challenges back and forth between players and GMs that are appropriate to the power level of the characters AND to the theme and tone of the game.  However, at any point, the players or the GM can ask the group if they can do something hardcore.  This generally means introducing some game element which is way out of line with the rest of what's been happening.  Someone will say, "Can I be hardcore?"  And then the rest of the group will shout, "YES!  HARDCORE," or they'll say, "No, not right now."  Sometimes there'll be a negotiation.  "How hardcore, on a scale of 1 to 10?" someone will ask.  "A 7 is too much.  Can you tone that down?"<br/><br/>So, as a GM, I've been advancing by earning my players' trust, and by having my HARDCORE!! be exciting and meaningful to them in the past.  These days, I rarely get turned down, and neither do they.<br/><br/>It may not be as sexy as having mechanics to handle GM advancement, but for our group, it works.  When I suggest something and the approving shout of "HARDCORE!!!!!" goes up, I get a little thrill down my spine.  It means that I've just earned advancement as a GM, and I know just how much my players are enjoying what I can do for them.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<p>Jess:  First off, with a smile, and in keeping with the first post ... you hippy! :-)</p>
<p>Second, I am intrigued.  Are people allowed to say "HARDCORE!" before anyone has asked whether they can go Hardcore?  Like, can it be a <em>demand</em> that the GM think up something bigger and tougher, rather than simply allowing the GM to deploy what she's already thought up?</p>

                            I'm totally in denial about being a hippie, but you just might be right.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>In any case, the actual use of "HARDCORE!!!" is mostly controlled by social contract, but it's kind of a mechanic for requesting or verifying escalation.<br/><br/>Often players will ask for the hardcore.  Usually they will have a character or a situation in mind.  For example: "Can Julia Perfidia be hardcore now?"  Or, "I want some hardcore plot with the Filii of Mercury."  Sometimes the players will just say, "Be hardcore now!"  That's a little harder to handle, but so far, so good.  And yes, it pretty clearly is a demand when the players initiate it!<br/><br/>Also, there is the understanding that asking for "HARDCORE!!" will always offer a benefit to the player who asked for it, in the form of interesting plot and GM attention . . . even if it screws the character over.  When the GMs ask for "HARDCORE!!" then they get the benefit of having a really interesting situation to respond to.  <br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<p>Well, dantai, as Jess points out, the GM <em>doesn't</em> have godlike omnipotency.  They skim on the delicate surface tension of what the players will let them do, just as the players are restricted by what the GM (and other players) will let them do.</p>
<p>Characters, and other mechanical tools, are a good way for people to communicate about that sort of thing, and lend authority in the case of conflicts and disagreements.  It's good for players, why wouldn't it be good for GMs?</p>
<p>We're not revoking the GM's godlike omnipotence.  We're waking from the pleasant but misguided delusion that it ever existed in the first place.</p>

If the other players have mechanical limits, why wouldn't the GM-player have mechanical limits? Or, if the GM-player's limits are all social, why wouldn't the other players' limits be purely social?                        </div>

                            I think one of the problems with all limits being mechanical, is that RPG's are an infinite game, generally speaking, and if the only limits are mechanical, then you're converting it into a finite game, which I'm not as interested in.<br/>

That's the point I was trying to get to earlier.<br/>

The reason to leave some limits implicit rather than explicit is so that there are tools available if the game veers out of the fun zone.                        </div>

<p>Explicit rules are not more "finite" than implicit rules.  They're just more explicit.  If I say "Make a character by picking five traits (a word or phrase) and assigning numbers to them" then I still have all the infinite possibilities of the english language (from "I've known pain - 5" to "Gobble the run bubblegum - 2" and everything in between) at my disposal.  That's not a finite system.</p>

<p>Well, I'm thinking pretty seriously about actually giving the GM a character sheet, with abilities and skills, and shit like that.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">

  PC:  Correct-a-mundo.  But since we captured Geezo I figure we can just lean on him until he spills.<br/>
  GM:  Okay then.  If you lose then you are taken into the hidden base in chains, and thrown in a dungeon to await Lord Hotori's judgment.<br/>
  PC:  Rockin'!  I roll with Heartless + Scary.<br/>
  GM:  Works for me.  You lean on Geezo and he immediately gives up the location.  I roll with Plot Twist + Adversity.  It turns out that Lord Hotori <strong>let</strong> you capture Geezo, knowing that you'd wrest the information from him.  Rolly, roll, roll.<br/>
  PC:  Whoa!  Look at those dice.  I can't beat that.<br/>
  GM:  Indeed, you walk right into his trap.  Foolish mortals!  To think you could outwit Lord Hotori!</p>

<p>... and then, of course, you could plow resources into raising your Plot Twist, or buffing up your Relationships score, or specializing in Dumb Fuckin' Luck, or some such thing.</p>

I said "converting" rather than "have converted" for a reason; the transformation is not complete.<br/>
<br/>
Every time you take something nebulous and nail it down, the conversion becomes more complete.<br/>
<br/>
Consider the following progression, for character generation:<br/>
<br/>
"Write three paragraphs about your character."<br/>
"Write three paragraphs about your character, and then underline nine words.  These are his 'keywords'"<br/>
"Write down nine sentences that describe your character."<br/>
"Choose nine traits for your character.  These can be any descriptive phrase, from 'strong' to 'wrestles full grown horses to the ground daily'"<br/>
"Pick nine traits for your character from among the following list:..."<br/>
"Assign 400 points to the following nine attributes..."<br/>
"Roll percentile dice nine times, and assign the numbers to the following nine attributes:..."<br/>
<br/>
The further down the list you go, the fewer options you have in creating your character.<br/>
<br/>
JoshNeff:<br/>
<br/>
The more locked-down a game gets, the fewer tools the GM has to bring things back into balance, the more carefully balanced the mechanics have to be, at least until you get to the level of KKKKK where things are SO locked down that they can't possibly go out of control.                        </div>

                            Let me follow up on what kleenestar was saying about "hardcore" in our games.  <br/>
<br/>
Addressing Mo specificially, when a GM not involved in a scene calls for hardcore they may be saying something like "can I be hardcore?" which is asking for permision to enter the scene and radically change its direction.  The permission is being asked of both the players and the GM already involved in the scene, which is pretty important.<br/>
<br/>
Its also worth noting that players (and GMs) can ask for less hardcore as well as more, which is pretty important, I think, since its suposed to mediate between between GMs and players.  Its not a very useful tool if you can only turn up the volume, so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
When a player says "that's a little too hardcore" they might be saying anything from "that level of supernatural weirdness strains my suspension of disbelif" to "I had a hard day at work and don't want to do an emotional scene right now" to "I'm more interested in other aspects of the story."  When a GM says it to another GM it maybe trying to anticipate player feelings, moderate the pace of the story, or the like.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, "Hardcore" is not really a simple tool as we use it.  Its not just about negotiating power in a scene, it can also be about story pacing and flow and out of game concerns of how much time is left in a play session.  <br/>

<p>So, then I was thinking, "Why doesn't the GM have a similar resource sheet?"</p>

<p>Which opens the door to questions like "Gosh ... what does it <em>mean</em> to give two players in our game two <em>different</em> resource sheets?  Like, if we give the GM resources to do X and all the other players resources to do Y, what does that do?"</p>
<p>A subset of that question that's started fascinating me:  "What things, essential to the story and the continuance of the game, should be doable <em>only</em> by the players, not by the GM?"</p>
<p>Like, in the simplistic example above, if you make a fantasy game in which <em>only</em> the players have "Heroism" on their sheet, but the GM has "NPC is inspired to heroism by a PC" ... that <strong>says</strong> something.</p>

                            Addressing something Tony is saying:<br/>
<br/>
"I don't really think of it as "converting" social limits into mechanical ones. I think of it as "exposing" social limits through mechanics. They're still social, they're just a lot easier to see in action."<br/>
<br/>
I guess I don't see why exposing all the social limits is a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
I think we can all agree that just about every novel follows the introduction, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution patern.  Hopefully our RPGs follow the same structure.  Books could have chapter headings like "third part, of six, of the rising action".  For me, at least, such a book would jar me out of the story and distract from the enjoyment of the text.  A similar roleplaying game, where I can see the climax coming from the build up of beads on the GM's sheet, also distracts me from the story being told.<br/>
<br/>
And what about things that have nothing to do with the story at all, but effect it none-the-less.  Social contract is a huge category from who can kill PC to who buys the pizza.  How do you expose the social limits on the actions a GM can take on Bob's character the night after Bob has just broken up with his girlfriend?  Is it even a good idea to expose such limits if half the group knows about the breakup and the other half does not?<br/>
<br/>
I am not arguing against limits on GM power (which already exist, as you say) or against exposing the social contract (explicit ones lead to less drama).  But I don't belive that totally exposed mechanics are benificial to a story nor are they suficient to run a story.  Implicit rules and non-mechanical solutions will always be needed.<br/>
<br/>
But I can totally agree that exposing some parts of the social limits can be useful, the question is where can we expose and where must we obscure?<br/>

I honestly have no idea what you're talking about there. Why is it the GM who has to bring things back into balance? Why does anyone <i>need</i> to bring things back into balance?

                            Joshua Neff:<br/>
<br/>
The other day, when we were playing ...in Spaaace! over IRC, I ran into a problem in the token economy.  (if you haven't downloaded the rules yet, do so, it's critical to the discussion of this topic)<br/>
<br/>
Many times when I, as GM, won a conflict (and thereby handed a token out) the narration I won would cause the players to laugh, which resulted in them EACH passing tokens back to me.<br/>
<br/>
In order to win conflicts, you have to have tokens.<br/>
<br/>
Winning conflicts gives you more opportunities to make people laugh.<br/>
<br/>
When you make people laugh, you get tokens.<br/>
<br/>
There was no way, in the game, that I could hand tokens back to the players, except when they 1&gt; made me laugh (it happened, just not as often) and 2&gt; lost conflicts.<br/>
<br/>
Do you see the problem?<br/>
<br/>
There was no way for me, as GM, to say (for example):<br/>
<br/>
"You didn't make me laugh, but that was a cool play anyways so I'm going to give you a token for it."<br/>
<br/>
"You lost SO big on this conflict that I'm going to give you THREE tokens."<br/>
<br/>
The reward system, being completely locked down, gave no room for me to adjust the token economy back on track.<br/>
<br/>
JBR:<br/>
<br/>
The Dogs GM sheet is iconic of the ideas presented here, but there's nothing in the rules that says that you have to use precisely six NPC's per town.... so the GM has the option, there, to have as many NPC's available as he wants.                        </div>

                            Is a GM sheet a regulation on GM power Joshua?  Were I to run Dogs I know that I'd write in the town section in pretty light pencil and change what I had to suit my understanding of the needs of the story.  Its not my impression that the Dog's sheet is intended as a public document, more of a worksheet to help the GM construct a "Dog's style" situation.<br/>
<br/>
It would be very interesting to see what a Dogs game would run like where the GM was not allowed to change his initial sheet, or to two so only in some systematic way.  What if the GM's sheet is as public as a player's sheet?<br/>
<br/>
And Tony -- it is a big topic, I don't mean to hijak your thread!  Maybe a more managable and relevant question is, "What are the limits on what power a GM can purchase in their advancement?"  Perhaps that can help frame the question of how a GM advances.<br/>

Because we were trying out the system for the first time, to see how it worked.  You can't see how a game works without playing it strictly by the rules.<br/>
<br/>
As it was, towards the end of the game, I threw up my hands and gave out tokens whenever the PC's did or said anything I felt was even mildly amusing, whether it made me laugh out loud or not.<br/>
<br/>
I have since put a question up on Greg's bb, to see if my experience was unique.                        </div>

                            I wasn't being clear.  The Stranger Things and Dogs GM Sheets are not implementations of this idea -- not yet.  But they are very potent tools that can very easily be used as inspiration for future implementations of this idea.  Chris' suggestions are a very good way to approach doing just that.<br/>

<p>Fred, two things.  First, you're shifting your ground massively here.  Your original claim was that games with rules were finite.  Now you're claiming that games with rules are constrained.  Those are wholly different arguments.</p>
<p>The set of all odd numbers is infinite.  That doesn't mean that there are even numbers in that set.  "Infinite" isn't the same as "everything."  The fact that there are things you cannot do in a game system does not mean that there are only a finite number of things you <em>can</em> do.</p>
<p>Second:  What the <em>fuck</em> is the relevance of this to ... dude ... <strong>anything</strong> that anyone else is talking about?  We're sitting around a table discussing shit, and you're like running off into the distance yelling "C'mon!  Follow me!  This is where the discussion is!"</p>

<i>The Dogs GM sheet is iconic of the ideas presented here, but there's nothing in the rules that says that you have to use precisely six NPC's per town.... so the GM has the option, there, to have as many NPC's available as he wants.</i><br/>True. But to use more than one GM sheet, the GM has to have more than six conflicts, each with a different NPC.<br/><br/>Of course players have generally had this freedom also, at least in the same serial sense that Dogs forces. Players have generally been able to roll up a new PC and introduce him if their first PC is dead (totally out of resources).<br/><br/>I think it's pretty cool that in Dogs, every player, GM or regular player, only gets to use one character at a time. If additional characters are helping you, you get an extra 2 dice plus a trait.<br/><br/>Hmm, and the GM in Dogs certainly gets to advance from town to town, in that he can push the players harder and harder on the issues that are interesting to the group.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

                            Tony, this has EVERYTHING to do with GM advancement mechanisms.<br/>
<br/>
There has to be some kind of dial that someone, somewhere can turn, to adjust the strength of the adversity that the PC's encounter, or else they start winning or losing all the time, which is boring.<br/>
<br/>
Well, no, I guess there doesn't HAVE to be a dial like that.<br/>
<br/>
You could have a game where the antagonists and the protagonists are in actual, real competition for dominance of the game, and when one side or the other achieves total dominance by advancing faster than the other, the game comes to an end and one side "wins."   But that's a finite game.<br/>
<br/>
On the topic of finite and infinite games, I'm using the meaning from the book "Finite and Infinite Games" by James P. Carse.  I probably should have mentioned that, and for that failure I'm sorry.<br/>

<i>Is a GM sheet a regulation on GM power Joshua? Were I to run Dogs I know that I'd write in the town section in pretty light pencil and change what I had to suit my understanding of the needs of the story. Its not my impression that the Dog's sheet is intended as a public document, more of a worksheet to help the GM construct a "Dog's style" situation.<br/><br/>It would be very interesting to see what a Dogs game would run like where the GM was not allowed to change his initial sheet, or to two so only in some systematic way. What if the GM's sheet is as public as a player's sheet?</i><br/>Hmm, are you talking about changing the one page town writeup, or changing things on the 6 proto-NPCs sheet? Definitely changing stuff on the later would be "cheating." I think also changing stuff on the town sheet, at least the sin hierarchy, would be "cheating" (what the NPCs want from the Dogs is certainly open to change, though I wouldn't change any particular character's wants until they've had a chance to be affected by play).<br/><br/>Changing the sin hierarchy strikes me as the GM attempting to judge.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

I also don't see what it has to do with what you said before about the GM being the person to bring the game back into balance.

What I mean by balance, is that state of being, where the probability of the PC's overcoming the adversity provided by the GM is greater than zero, but less than one.<br/>
<br/>
If the GM isn't the one providing adversity, then the problem disappears.<br/>
<br/>
If the GM can advance independently of the players, then, concievably, the level of adversity can grow independently.  <br/>
<br/>
If the GM's resources are not used to buy adversity, then this problem disappears.<br/>
<br/>
If the GM's adversity can grow independently of the PC's, then either side can, concievably, become dominant, and create a situation where either the adversity or the PC's can win virtually any conflict.<br/>
<br/>
If the participants don't find one-sided conflicts boring, then this is not a problem.<br/>
<br/>
I maintain that:<br/>
GM's usually provide adversity<br/>
GM resources used for buying adversity is what we're talking about (correct me if I'm wrong)<br/>
participants usually find one-sided conflicts boring.<br/>
<br/>
In ...in Spaaace! the GM resources are used to buy adversity.  If GM resources would NOT be used to buy adversity, what would they be used to buy?  What aspect of the GM's job would they fuel?                        </div>

                            Fred - in Dogs, certainly the PCs could advance to the point where they have a silly amount of dice, and the only way the GM can push them is to bring in mobs. Does that mean the player "wins?" No I don't think so, but the player has made a pretty strong statement. Of course the GM can still push hard on the issues. Because he can say "well, is Y still true when the mob does X?"<br/>
<br/>
So yea, I agree, to have an infinite game, one does need to have a way to constantly offer adversity.<br/>
<br/>
But here's a question: in this sense, is an infinite game actually desireable? Years ago, I would have said definitely yes. These days, my answer would be no. Now I think I still don't want a real hard stop, though in one sense that would be a lot better. Of course even with a hard stop on advancement, the game need not necessarily be finite. Since the early days of D&amp;D, people in long term games have retired characters, yet even years later, when perhaps even the players are no longer the same, let along the characters, it's clearly the same game since everything that has gone on before is still part of the game, and often informs current play ("Remember when...." - that's a statement trying to bring something into the SIS, and if the group accepts it, it becomes a contribution to the current SIS - whether the memory was something from earlier that session, last week, or last decade...).<br/>

                            Just as a potential clarification, here, Tony's been talking about GM Resources in a very abstract form -- rolling Plot Twist and Mysterious Development, rather than in terms of actual, concrete NPCs and set dressings.  I'm not entirely sold on that idea, but there's little-to-no worry about these very generic resources being out of place or inapplicable, whether in terms of geography or power balance.                        </div>

<p>I'm talking about the panoply of options.  Balanced adversity is <em>one</em> of them.  When that's not working, you go to another one.</p>
<p>For instance, if you'd started throwing brutal, vicious adversity at your players in In Space, you would have <em>trounced them</em>, right?  You would have utterly devastated them.  They wouldn't have stood a chance.  Man, that would have been fucking <strong>funny</strong>.  A GM just <em>has</em> to laugh at people as they squirm like little insects beneath his huge and grinding heel.  And, having laughed, he has to give out tokens, because hey, their suffering made him laugh!</p>
<p>Balanced adversity is a nice tool.  It's not the only tool.</p>

<p>I thought the discussion with Timfire (<strong>way</strong> upthread) about negative feedback as a balancing mechanism had covered that.  <em>If</em> that's a balance you want to achieve, that's a way to achieve it.</p>
<p>Does that not strike you as a feasible answer?</p>

                            Tony, you seem to be disputing the assumption that participants usually find one-sided conflicts boring, without actually saying so.<br/><br/>I don't think many people are terribly interested in playing a game based on the narrative structure of Kafka's <i>Metamorphosis</i>. (for those of you who were not subjected to this book in high school, the main character wakes up one morning to find that he has transformed into a giant cockroach.  His life goes downhill from there, and he eventually dies worthless, forgotten, and alone)<br/><br/>Yes, I did throw brutal, vicious adversity at the PC's.  They were puppets dancing on the end of a string.  They didn't stand a chance.  It was boring as hell.  Luckily, they found some of the descriptions funny... which meant that the tokens went right back into my hands.  I thought I already described that part?                        </div>

                            Okay, so let's say I've got this game. In the game, each player has one character that he or she plays (let's call those Player Characters, or PCs), except for one player--the GM--who plays all of the other characters (which we'll call GM Characters, or GMCs). Let's say the GM stars off playing [PCsx2] GMCs, so if you have 3 PCs, the GM starts with 6 GMCs. Conflicts are always between PCs and GMCs, so if any character has a conflict with something that isn't a PC or a GMC, you say yes and don't roll the dice.<br/><br/>Now, in this game, the GM is not responsible for providing adversity. All players are responsible for providing adversity for all other players. So, you could have PC vs. PC conflict, or PC vs. GMC conflict. Let's also say that as the non-GM players play and win conflicts, they get more resources to use in play. And as the GM plays and wins conflicts, s/he gets more resources to use in play--say, more GMCs to play with, or maybe more powerful GMCs, or something.<br/><br/>Or let's say there's a game where the GM is solely responsible for scene framing. As the non-GM players get more resources through play, so does the GM, so that through play, the GM gains the ability to frame flashbacks or flashfowards or dream sequences. (Hmmmm. A <i>Lost</i> RPG?)<br/><br/>Fred, if you're assuming that it's the GM's responsibility to provide adversity, I think that's only sometimes true, but not always. If you're assuming it's the GM's responsibility to make sure the conflicts are always balanced, I think that's only sometimes true, but not always. Do you see where I'm going with this?                        </div>

                            A negative feedback mechanism means that the GM isn't advancing independently of the PC's.  His advancement is tied to theirs... which addresses one of my concerns, which is with <i>independent</i> GM advancement.<br/><br/>If GM advancement is dependent upon PC advancement, then you have a system much like DnD's challenge rating system, where the GM earns the right to throw bigger monsters at the PC's because the PC's have grown big enough to take them.                        </div>

                            Sort of, Tony.  I'm talking fit adversity, not balanced adversity.  Balanced adversity is basically a moderatly complicated math problem that can be solved with a little effort and trial and error.  Fit adversity has more to do with hitting player flags in a meaningful way, making the challenges that they face significant and engaging rather than merely offering them a mechanically-difficult-but-possible-to-win tactical situation.<br/><br/>I can see the GM being rewarded for providing those kinds of challenges, but then if that's the GM's role I don't see why he gets all jazzed about upgrading to fire-breathing dragons when he can probably get more emotional oomph out of the scullery maid who's having a PC's bastard child.  Unless you somehow define the GM resources in terms of relationships and thematic impact, but then you're basically giving the GM a budget of a dollar fifty and telling him that he needs to spend two dollars if he wants to make another dollar fifty for the next session.<br/><br/>Obviously, we're tinkering with the root role of the GM, but can you give us an idea, Tony, of what you think the GM's role might be under such a system, and what the draw would be for a real person to want to take up that role?                        </div>

<p>Is there any chance we can convince you to split this argument off into its own thread so that was can get back to the productive discussions we have when we aren't wrestling with your preconceptions?</p>

<p>So ... what's your issue here?  Do you believe that making the GM's resources and their growth explicit through mechanics (rather than implicit and social) will make it <em>harder</em> for the GM to hit those player flags?</p>
<p>Or are you simply saying that making the GM resources explicit won't solve that problem?</p>
<p>Because the second ... yeah, I agree.  It may give us some new tools to address the problem of how people communicate and make stories, but it's not going to solve the problem.</p>
<p>The first though ... I'd need to hear some reasons to worry about that before I started worrying.</p>

Or as was mentioned way above, let the GM cash in other unused resources to re-apply them to the player's request.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

<p>Uh ... again, question.  Are you saying that there is no <em>inherent</em> connection between letting the GM do new things and helping to hit the player flags?  Or are you saying that it is <em>impossible</em> to make an advancement system that makes it progressively easier for the GM to hit player flags?</p>

<p>No.  That sounds like it might be <strong>one good way</strong> to build a reward system, but I'm sure as shooting not saying that it is the only possible way.</p>

There are pitfalls that need to be addressed when making a system like this (just like any other system) and I believe that we have identified where a few of them might be.   That's an important thing to do when striking out into uncharted territory.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I think, it's time to actually start hiking.                        </div>

<blockquote>If we're talking about GM advancement, then there has to be a GM, and he has to do GM tasks. I think that's a reasonable assumption.</blockquote>
Yes.
<blockquote>Since a GM can't "advance" if his resources are, mechanically if not in the social contract, infinite, we're talking abut a situation where the GM's resources are, mechanically, finite.</blockquote>
Yes.<br/><br/>Well, as much as a player's resources are. As Tony said, a player may not have to spend any resources each time a PC swings a sword. It's reasonable to assume the GM would have the same kind of freedom.
<blockquote>One of the main differences between GM tasks and player tasks, is that GM tasks are performed at the request of the player.</blockquote>
And you lost me. <i>In some games</i>, GM tasks are performed at the request of the player. That is not necessarily true for all RPGs ever, especially ones that haven't been designed yet.
<blockquote>What happens when the GM doesn't have enough resources to fulfill a player's request, or to satisfy a player's unstated need? Does it go unfulfilled? Is that fun when it happens?</blockquote>
The player fulfills the request him- or herself? Another non-GM player fulfills the request? What happens when a player doesn't have the resources to fulfull a GM request? ("Dammit! I really want you to defeat this bad guy so you can move on to the big boss!") We don't know yet because we're talking about a wide range of games in which player and GM tasks and responsibilities may be different.                        </div>

                            Tony, OtherOtherJoshua, I'm going to agree with Fred, here.  The bulk of your arguments so far have been, "Well, there might be a reason that you'd want to do this."  Until we have reasons to advance the GM, which more-or-less means a (re)definition of what the GM does in a specific game, we can't really progress very much further, here.<br/>

<p>So I'm rewinding way back to before we were talking about whether we were supposed to be talking about general cases ... four hours and <em>fifty</em> posts ago.  Sheesh.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm pretty fascinated by trying to apply the traditional "ability + skill" dichotomy from many games to the GM issue, particularly in the way that Storyteller games did, where skills were not a sub-set of abilities, but rather the two could be cross-producted in many ways ("Manipulation + Driving" anyone?)</p>
<p>The whole dichotomy between in-bred talent and trained ability is ... well, wonky at best.  But the idea of deriving totals from the combinations is a great tool to boost creativity, and I'm up for stealing it.</p>
<p>But how would you divide things?  Here's a proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abilities map to what you are actually doing to the story ... Plot Twist, Adversity, Relationships, etc.  </li>
<li>Skills map to the type of story element by which you are doing it ... Mooks, Politics, Circumstance, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Already, even with the small list, I see possibilities:  Plot Twist + Mooks, Adversity + Circumstance ... I know how to combine these things.</p>

                            I have been watching this thread with the kind of horrified interest that most people watch millipede dissection with. It's fascinating but horrible and I don't want to touch it without sterilized gloves on and a sharp implement in my hands. However, it took a turn and I do want to kick in a little bit with a "middlin'" mechanic I put together for MURPG. Now, for those of you who aren't one of the nine people who bought the Marvel Universe RPG, this game is played with "stones" of effort, you put stones in the action boxes on your sheet that your character is doing and those are compared to a target number or the stones of their opponent.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I have always tried to do in comic book games is to simulate the rising and falling action of the badguys.  That is, no matter how wuss the villain or how brazenly idiotic their plan, in the first segment of the plot arc, they're winning, they can do nothing wrong, the heroes are falling all over themselves just to keep things hanging on.  Once the heroes gather some information, have some personal crises, and so on, they start to win, and by the end, no contingency plan, however masterful, can save the villain, no matter how powerful.<br/>
<br/>
In Adventure!, I did this by giving a boatload of Inspiration to the villains, but not allowing them to regenerate it, as the heroes did.<br/>
<br/>
In MURPG, with the stone mechanic, I implemented the following rule:<br/>
<br/>
There are two Drama Pools, one for the Villains, and one for the Heroes. (Note that non-villainous NPCs cannot draw on any Drama Pools.) All stones in Drama Pools are red stones. <br/>
<br/>
The Heroes' Drama Pool starts with one stone for every player character. <br/>
<br/>
The Villains' Drama Pool starts with one stone for every player character, plus one stone for every rank of EITHER: Wealth, Intelligence or Influence that the main villain of the scenario has. If there is a team of villains, they must pick a single stat from a single villain.  (Ed. note - I wanted the masterminds to have a longer arc than the brutes, after all their contingency plans are what make things last so long in comic book arcs).<br/>
<br/>
The Drama Pool provides extra red stones to any Action at any time. The normal "cap" of the Action Number still applies, and you cannot use more red stones from your Drama Pool than you are using from your own Energy Pool. (Put another way, at least half of the red stones you are putting in the Action must be from your own Energy Pool.)  (Ed. note - I wanted it to be a boost but not to completely get rid of the underlying fatigue/injury/effort system.)<br/>
<br/>
When Villains spend a stone out of their Drama Pool, one is added to the Heroes' Drama Pool. (The reverse is not true.)  (Ed. note: Thus, the Heroes' pool is constantly being replenished as villains beat on them.)<br/>
<br/>
When a Hero faces a Limitation, a red stone is added to the Drama Pool. (Ed. note: "Oh no, everyone hates mutants...I guess I'll go beat up evil chicks with bad hair...!")<br/>
<br/>
When a Hero takes blue stone damage, a red stone is added to the Drama Pool. (Only one stone is added no matter how many stones of damage the Hero suffers.) <br/>
<br/>
Drama Pools are restarted after every Mission. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps to show a "middle path" whereby this sort of thing can be added to "regular" systems.                        </div>

<p>Tony: How do you see the ability + skill system for the GM working with NPCs?</p>

<p>I'm thinking that skill one.  "Allies + Recurring NPC," "Plot Twist + Organization," that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Heh.</p>
<p>Neon Genesis Evangelion has a specialist-high Organization skill, coupled with a broad base of abilities like "Allies," "Plot Twist," "Adversity," "Relationships" and so on.  So everything the GM wants to do, he does using NERV.  It is father and lover and enemy and mystery, all in one.</p>
<p>Likewise "Dude, <strong>of course</strong> he's your father!  You thought George has been sinking all his level-ups into Relationships and Untouchable Enemy for the past three months because he <em>wasn't</em> going to roll them together one day?"</p>
