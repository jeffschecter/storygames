It was good!<br/><br/>What I did: I facilitated Fiasco (Rainbow Mountain), The Venetian Tragedy, How We Came To Live Here, and Love in the Time of Sei\xf0. I played Pickets and Blinds, and Time and Temp. Realized that the DC crew is part of my local posse now. Played some board games, hung out with distant friends, made some fun plans.<br/><br/>Highlights: A father shot his own son to preserve his crumbling cult. Justice was meted out to a traitorous daughter beneath the hooves of a trampling horse. A brave man make a cowardly deal with a monster that would ultimately destroy him. A bestial bride got brutal revenge on her evil groom. A cop gone astonishingly bad was felled with his own gun, by his own wife. In return for saving the universe from paradoxical erasure, five temps negotiated a half day on Friday.<br/><br/>How about you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Esarel" title="Esarel"><img alt="Esarel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Esarel">Esarel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314569/#Comment_314569" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-27T17:24:23+00:00" title="February 27, 2011  5:24PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dreamation was awesome this year.<br/><br/>I got to try Apocalypse world, Freemarket, Human Contact, and How we came to live here for the first time.

Meanwhile, the poor native engineer who had designed a better form of android and thus put himself out of a job was reduced to an unemployed drunk after he had a final confrontation with his Academic ex-wife, when she tried to convince him that his attempts to create androids who could genuinely reproduce was a bad idea, and he tried to cast her out of his life, once and for all.<br><br>- In Apocalypse World, the Hocus convinced the leader of a rival religious biker group, the Paladins, to kill himself with his sword in order to guarantee the safety of the rest of the Paladins, both from the orgy of violence which the Hocus had caused with Frenzy, and from the incoming fog rolling in from the sea and the horrid creatures hidden therein. The sword that the Paladin leader used to kill himself was the Hoarder's one and only goal (HIS HOARD DEMANDED IT), making it that much more awesome. Eventually, the fog rolled in, and the Hocus was perfectly content to let the Paladins try to get back to their bikes and leave town. The Paladins didn't make it. They were found the next day in neat chunks of flesh.<br><br>- In Fiasco, after getting the Bared Blade, a rogue-ish Zorro type trying to resist the conquering might of the First Emperor, to train him by coercion, the impetuous youth (my character) screwed up a heist by killing a tax collector, and grew a taste for blood, ultimately leading to a final confrontation in which he had decided to kill the governor in a fit of misguided rage (at his father, for having left him to go fight in a war), but the Bared Blade returned from what had been assumed to be his death (when he and his love went over a cliff on a flaming, out-of-control ox-cart), and tried to prevent my character from committing the murder. This resulted in a rooftop duel, in which the impetuous youth cut off the Bared Blade's mask, revealing the latter's identity, and then allowed himself (the impetuous youth) to be captured by the Imperial guards in order to give the Bared Blade time to run, only to then be released by the guards when the impetuous youth's father turned himself in, falsely claiming to be the brains behind the Bared Blade, in order to preserve the impetuous youth's freedom. (Which didn't last for long, as the father was ultimately executed in prison, and they imprisoned the impetuous youth shortly afterward.)<br><br>- In the Saturday night session of Human Contact, it turned out that the entire reason there was a religious schism between those who worshiped, but did not understand, the machines, and those who wished to understand them better, was because those machines, which governed reproduction and genetic traits, were running a program designed to increase survival, and were rolling back previously enacted changes which had been necessary for survival at the time, but were no longer necessary. Then, the Academics attempted to fix the system, with one attempting to make the reproduction system write the "machine-worshiping" traits back into the colony's population, while another attempted to run an anthropological study by having the reproduction systems write in a new caste, a "god caste", for the society's in-born caste system. Meanwhile, the High Priestess (or, Mkuts, in the colony's tongue) of the machines stepped down from her post in favor of her clerk, in order to convince the rebelling religious faction that the machines were, in fact, holy, and expressed the will of the Divine. She defused the rebellion, but the situation was engineered by another Academic to fix their caste system in order to allow individuals to rise above their born stations. It was much more likely to lead to the destruction of this society's order and structure, of course.<br><br><br>(Breathe out.)<br><br>Sorry for the long descriptions and the fanboy run-on sentences, but man.

Here I go again<br/><br/>Dreamation was a great time as always. I enjoy the opportunities to see familiar friendly faces and to meet new folks that I hope will become familiar.<br/><br/>On to what I played:<br/><br/>1) Happy Birthday Robot! - We made a cute little story about Robot and the surprise party planned by his friends the shy ninja and the space pirate. I bought this game, because I think it will be great to play with my son.<br/><br/>2) Bulldogs - I played the pilot of our little crew that had to lead the group as they tried to track down and retrieve their stolen cargo without getting killed or worse having their pay docked. My character did end up getting docked in pay as he attempted to shield the rest of the crew from the captain's drunken anger. I have to throw props out to Frank (whose last name I've forgotten) who had me almost in tears laughing with his portrayal of our forgetful robot engineer.<br/><br/>3)  Trail of Cthulhu - The big bad was cool, but the tensions built into the characters of the scenario we were playing was the best part. My character wanted to protect his former master's son (Warren) while at the same time trying to become a cultist and prevent Warren from taking revenge on the cult. He succeeded in that first goal but failed to prevent the group from stopping Kutha. Feeling broken and defeated at the end, he accepted a bullet to the head from one of the other character's since he felt that he didn't have a reason to live anymore.<br/><br/>4) Fiasco - I got to play the Bared Blade, who tried to save his people, his girl, and his protege. He failed spectacularly at all of these when his protege unmasked him and he cowardly ran from the fight. (Apparently I also play a decent evil governor.... must be the goatee)<br/><br/>5) Prehistoric Ties - I got to run one playtest of Prehistoric Ties. The parents of our little family unit were constantly bickering. The mother thought that the child needed a constant watchful eye and her mate wasn't stepping up to provide that. The father felt that his kid was a genius and would be fine on his own, but had issues with the quality of his wife's cooking. The game ended after the parents managed to roast a Tyrannosaurus in a forest fire. The mother's view of the the father shifted so that she now simply thought that he spoiled the boy. He felt that the cooked dinosaur was great, but she could still improve more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314611/#Comment_314611" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-27T20:42:57+00:00" title="February 27, 2011  8:42PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Time &amp; Temp<br/>Zombie Cinema<br/>Venetian Tragedy<br/>Human Contact: touching humans, touching you<br/>Freemarket<br/>Lady Blackbird<br/>Fiasco<br/>indie design roundtable<br/><br/>so much laughter<br/>great people<br/><br/>thank you all                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314689/#Comment_314689" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-28T07:38:06+00:00" title="February 28, 2011  7:38AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2011 7:40AM by Brian_Minter.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was only there on Saturday, but my friend Troy and I had a great time.

And it was only 2.5 hours (started 30 minutes late, ended an hour early).<br/><br/>Brian's reading of the intro was the best game introduction (the text was great but Brian's delivery was heart pumping) that I have ever experienced (no exaggeration). <br/><br/>Then we hit our next highlight\u2026 Todd teleported. <br/><br/>That doesn't do it justice. Imagine you're having lunch with your mom during thanksgiving in real life and she says, "I'll be right back" and she teleports! How would you react? That's what happened. Even the GM didn't know Todd (his character, maybe) could teleport. <br/><br/>From that moment on\u2026 man I can't possibly do the actual play justice\u2026 trust me, it was moment after moment of epic hilarity.  <br/><br/>Brian, if you are ever in NYC, let us know and we'll throw you a party in exchange for a sequel!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314737/#Comment_314737" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-28T11:13:02+00:00" title="February 28, 2011 11:13AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll talk more about my games and the wonderful people I played with later (I hope).

Then, the Academics attempted to fix the system, with one attempting to make the reproduction system write the "machine-worshiping" traits back into the colony's population, while another attempted to run an anthropological study by having the reproduction systems write in a new caste, a "god caste", for the society's in-born caste system. Meanwhile, the High Priestess (or, Mkuts, in the colony's tongue) of the machines stepped down from her post in favor of her clerk, in order to convince the rebelling religious faction that the machines were, in fact, holy, and expressed the will of the Divine. She defused the rebellion, but the situation was engineered by another Academic to fix their caste system in order to allow individuals to rise above their born stations. It was much more likely to lead to the destruction of this society's order and structure, of course.<br/></blockquote>\nI was in this game as well.  It was awesome.

The group I had Saturday night took a little while to warm up, but the chemistry really clicked near the end of the first game (Regina's Wedding Playset)... Regina sacrificed herself to save her mother's life, rescuing her from the poisonous scorpion she herself had placed in her mother's shoe as an attempt to break out of the lesbian mother-daughter relationship that had been fostering for years. Incestual mother-of-the-bride realized the deep emotional scarring she had caused and threw herself off of the church steeple. The last thing she heard was her daughter barely squeak out "No, mother!" just as mother hit the pavement. At that moment the father of the groom, outed as a child-wife-stealing polygamist, shot his only son, then used his body as a human shield against FBI agents to escape by crashing through the stained-glass window. A rogue agent (who until this point was only known as the m-of-the-b's drug dealer) pummeled the priest for ruining his moment of glory and nearly blew up the church, witnesses and all. Only Regina and her nearly father-in-law survived the ordeal, Regina to search out the man who ruined her life, and the father of the groom, to live an Orwell-esque life wasted on booze and loose women. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere were a few other note-worthy moments as well, but I would end up writing a novel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doug%20Bonar" title="Doug Bonar"><img alt="Doug Bonar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doug%20Bonar">Doug Bonar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314832/#Comment_314832" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-28T19:03:15+00:00" title="February 28, 2011  7:03PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brian Minter</cite><br/>I got to play in Bill White's 'Rex Rich and the Warlord of Mars' SotC game, which was great.

I\u2019ll testify, brothers and sisters!<br/><br/>I played Shock: Human Contact with Joshua, Witt, and Amber. You probably know that Human Contact is like a hard-SF Star Trek, the Federation cross-bred with Iain Banks\u2019 Culture. I played a smug linguist with strong participationist leanings (prime directive, shmime directive) who wanted to change the culture of a colony world orbiting inside a Dyson Sphere so that its oppressive intellectual property regime would be overthrown. My favorite part was convincing Witt as my antagonist, an observationist conflict specialist, to help me because that was the only way he could <i>scientifically</i> show that I was wrong. \u201cIf you falsify participationism, you\u2019re a scientist,\u201d I said. \u201cIf you <i>suppress</i> it,  you\u2019re a politician.\u201d But it was all great fun, and really intriguing, and I think we all felt really <i>smart</i> about the world we'd created.<br/><br/>I had fun SageFighting, but I need to fix Daniel\u2019s comment or else I\u2019ll feel self-conscious and ashamed:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>Bill White is totally <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">cheating!</span> losing.</blockquote>\nThere, that\u2019s better.  Seriously, though, SageFight! was a good time. There was a great energy in the room, and Daniel did a great job of bringing people in and getting them involved. It was a nice way for me to end the convention.<br/><br/>I ran <i>Spirit of the Century</i>, and I was pleased that \u201cRex Rich and the Warlord of Mars\u201d was so much fun. The players were marvellous to a man\u2014Brian Minter as girl genius Skipper Redstone, Rich Flynn as tough guy PI Max Mensch, Doug Bonar as teenage rocket scientist Snap Redstone (and his barnstorming older brother Jack when necessary), Steve McFadden as the eponymous Rex Rich, Greg Phillips as Tan-Gliil the Man from Mars, and Brian\u2019s friend Troy (Walker?) as Dr. Einstein, the World\u2019s Greatest Mind. I think even with six players the spotlight time was pretty equitably divided, and everyone had a chance to do something cool. I think I did a nice bit of GMing during the final confrontation with Air-Baron Zevo when Rich Flynn was disappointed that Rex Rich had stolen Max Mensch\u2019s thunder by sending gyropack-equipped goons to attack by proxy, when Max had risked life and limb by jetting over to the Zevodrome himself and mixing it up personally. \u201cListen, Max,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Rex Rich <i>does</i>. You work for him; you know that.\u201d Rich pressed his lips together and nodded, ruefully resigned. I should have given him a Fate point for Max\u2019s aspect: <i>Oy vey,</i> this<i> I need</i>.<br/><br/>I also ran two sessions of <i>Trail of Cthulhu</i>, my own \u201cThe Big Hoodoo,\u201d and Jason Morningstar\u2019s soon-to-be-published \u201cMany Fires.\u201d  Both went very well. \u201cThe Big Hoodoo\u201d was creepy thanks mainly to jenskot\u2019s portrayal of Tony Boucher\u2019s abandonment of Roman Catholicism and whole-hearted embrace of a Mythos-fueled occult religion. And \u201cMany Fires\u201d was neat; the high point of the adventure wasn\u2019t the big fight against the cult at the end; it was the showdown among the players <i>after</i> the big fight so that they could reveal the secrets they\u2019d been carrying around (and mystifying each other with) for the whole game. It ended in a player-on-player bloodbath, with Dave Cleaver\u2019s character gratefully accepting the bullet to the head that came his way, since his dreams had already died.<br/><br/>And I started the convention by running two playtest sessions of a game I\u2019m working on called <i>The New World</i>.  Those sessions were extremely productive and useful for me, although in telling Sam Zeitlin about it, he joked, \u201cShow me on the doll where the players touched your game, Bill.\u201d But it\u2019s not like that; what happened was I got to receive a ton of indie-scene story-gamer crowd-wisdom as well as some savvy insights from individual participants. So in my head the game is now <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i> meets <i>The Selfish Gene</i> via Roger Zelazny\u2019s \u201cGame of Blood and Dust,\u201d with the players as self-replicating memes fighting to force history down alternate branches.

I got to play with a ton of great people like John (Jenskot), Ralph Mazza, Daniel Solis, John Parish (I think I'm spelling his last night correctly), Buddha and Jason, and so many other great people. <br/><br/>I only ran games this time around, so I ran three different games to try and get in as varied a play experience as possible. My first session was Whispering Vault, which I enjoyed but I felt like the scenario didn't quite sing. The players were great and really put the work out there, but I think that I may have dropped the ball a little on prompting player response and narration. Also, it felt a little unpolished to me. All together, not bad, but I think I could have pulled out better work. If I run WV again, I'll probably go back to running my first scenario, London Falling, which works much better. <br/><br/>Then I ran Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 3rd, which rocked the hell out. There were bloody battles, giant Chaos-mutated Norscan raiders, villagers pushed to blasphemy and terrorism by starvation, and so much smack-talk and inter-party conflict from the PCs that I was laughing uproariously for probably half the game. Three of the four players at the table had never played WFRP3 before, but you couldn't tell by looking. They really grabbed on to the mechanics and in-the-moment rewards of WFRP3 and came out full-swinging within just a couple of minutes of starting gameplay. They reacted in fun and cool ways to the problems, both physical and moral, set before them and really made the game their own. The troll-slayer ran up the length of a nine-foot long sword to deliver a killshot, the Sister of Sigmar brought the most savage of peace to a dying woman, the road warden brought pathos by the shovelful, and the Grey Wizard breathed shadows. That game was metal. <br/><br/>Saturday saw me run another playtest of Criminal Element, which ran wonderfully. I'm still seeing some minor issues in conflict resolution that I need to work out, but the game ran damn fine. The crooks went on an Italian Job by way of Michael Mann style revenge trip against a former friend and stole wives, corrupted security chiefs, and killed a bunch of child slavers, and topped it of with a heaping helping of explosions. The players really grabbed onto the helping mechanics and constantly shifted cards around the table. A solid playtest, and a great session. <br/><br/>I cannot thank my players enough for showing me such a great time during the con. Thanks, guys!<br/><br/>I did get to play in one other game though, and that was Sagefight! I had a blast voguing my way around the room, karate chopping my enemies. Thank you, Daniel, for organizing such a fun game. And Dave, I will always defend my Master! Deadly Cleaver Clan for life!<br/><br/>As always, I didn't get to hang out with people nearly as much as I wanted to, but I'm thankful for the time we had together and I cannot wait until we get to hang out and play next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314949/#Comment_314949" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-01T11:59:38+00:00" title="March  1, 2011 11:59AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cleaver Clan?

Thanks to Brendan, we ran five tables of Human Contact. Every one was excellent. Amber brought the highlight, though; abandoning the two other envoys on the planet, she launched the Messenger out to another orbit to get in a space battle and meet with the leader of the single actual union (as opposed to the all-encompassing astroturf union that was creating the Dyson sphere). While Bill's Envoy, a linguist, bickered about who was doing real science, Amber's, an engineer, was <em>gettin' shit done.</em> That said, Bill invented the Internet, which gave Amber's revolutionary friends a chance to get around the draconian censorship of the society.</p>\n<p>That said, she coulda died, and Bill could have been completely stranded with only an asshole rival for companionship, having opted against disguising himself as a local. I threw the biggest dice I could, but Amber made it really hard for me to one-side my dice. She was awesome.</p>\n<p>Sagefight, yes, supafun.</p>\n<p>Bill's New World was an interesting and well-developed sketch. I'd like to see it hew more closely to Guns, Germs, and Steel, which means that there are going to be losers from the beginning. That means to me that the competitive aspect has to either go away altogether or it has to have nothing to do with the successes of particular peoples, but with the successes of their cultures in affecting other cultures. Right now, you can affect other regions, but can't expand; it leaves us with a weird, location-based essentialism that isn't what you want.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315304/#Comment_315304" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-03T11:29:56+00:00" title="March  3, 2011 11:29AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            props to Joshua for doing such a great job of hacking together the sales area!  and thanks again to the Millers for another wonderful IGE (and for correctly steering me to an almost invisible Apocalypse World game on Saturday morning.)<br/><br/>it "felt" a little more like a Dexcon than a Dreamation this year; but much fun was had.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315305/#Comment_315305" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-03T11:31:35+00:00" title="March  3, 2011 11:31AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Double King</cite>it "felt" a little more like a Dexcon than a Dreamation this year</blockquote>\nWhat does that mean?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315307/#Comment_315307" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-03T11:36:51+00:00" title="March  3, 2011 11:36AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd agree with Eric's statement.

Missed you guys last year..<br/><br/>I also tried out Bill's New World. I like the idea of alternate histories, in that aspect it reminds me of Microscope. Which Bill needs to check out.<br/>I like some of the boardgaming bits, some is missing thought. I feel playing with the entire world is kinda crazy. Bill can you share some inspirational sources, ie this game makes stories like..  <br/><br/>We probably should split off to discuss what we like about BNW.. <br/><br/>I ran Mortal Coil, twice. I used the Saint-Germain Legacy, Campaign Frame. Worked great, both times I let the players throw down ideas and ran with what they gave me.<br/><br/>On to Remember Tomorrow, it's GMless, Cyberpunk. This was my Saturday 9am game, I was expecting more interest. Did Saturday morning seem light to anyone else?<br/>Anyhow.. after I recruited players, I had 4 people playing, so I decided to sit this game out and just facilitate. I did throw in three characters in the pool, and helped sharpen everyone's held PC's goals. <br/><br/>Then a strange thing happened, it ran it's self. I was ready to take a break, when the players told me no. That I could go ahead and take one, they were good.<br/>This was the first time I had sat out of a GMless game, and just helped with the rules.. and the first time the players got it so well, they didn't need me. <br/><br/>Has this happened to any of you?<br/><br/>Lastly I was wondering, I recorded two of my games.

No Jeepform. No international visitors (or maybe there were and I missed them!). No Emily Care Boss. Actually most of the Western Mass crew was absent (way to represent Rob &amp; Joshua! Eppy doesn't count) and some individuals that sometimes come from further away (California, Canada, etc.).<br/><br/>BUT, though their absences were felt, there was an abundance of awesome, as always. I had great time GMing Burning Wheel, Antagonizing in Shock: Human Contact, and playing Misspent Youth (which I wish had gone on for like, 2 more hours!). I wish I'd had more time to chat with people and play more games, but I think I felt that way even before we had a baby and it only speaks to the quality of both people and games. <br/><br/>I love you guys - can't wait till Camp Nerdly!<br/><br/>-Rachel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315430/#Comment_315430" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T04:19:35+00:00" title="March  4, 2011  4:19AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a crazy busy con. I ran five sessions and played in one. <br/><br/>First up I ran my storytelling games Thursday night: Three Black Crows, Three Dead Men and Sparks from a Fire. Those went great. There are a couple of edits to Sparks from a Fire, but it works pretty well. First time testing it, and Three Black Crows as well. As I said at the time, people don't need a lot of encouragement to tell stories.<br/><br/>Two Fiasco sessions, The Ice and The Jersey Side. Both went great, we had wonderful Fiascos and everyone got what they deserved (mostly). In the Ice I played a scummy Antarctic fixer who sold drugs and scammed newbies. She got shot and lost in the dark and wandered out on the ice and died. In the Jersey Side, I was a crooked SEC regulator who flipped as soon as the authorities came nosing around, then fled the country with my younger gay lover. Super fun times. That was the game with the scary Hasidic gangster godfather.<br/><br/>I got a chance to run Julia's Hag Ride scenario for Mortal Coil. That worked great, with two pre-gens and one character built right at the table. Lots of great Southern magic, including a deal with the Devil at the crossroads. Two out of three PCs died in that one, but it was a happy ending anyway (one of them was already dead, technically. He was a ghost). <br/><br/>Also, a session of How We Came to Live Here and the aforementioned Bulldogs game. Both went well, I think I was a little tired when Bulldogs rolled around and that didn't end up lasting the whole slot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315433/#Comment_315433" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T04:33:56+00:00" title="March  4, 2011  4:33AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: zipht</cite>Then a strange thing happened, it ran it's self.
