Please don't just react to the subject. <br/><br/><b>TOPIC: </b><br/><br/><span style="font-size: medium; font-size: medium;">- Are you a women and/or person of color? <br/><br/>- Do you feel Story Games is a welcoming community? <br/><br/>- Have you had positive experiences here?</span><br/><br/><b>GOAL: </b><br/><br/>Create a safe space for people to share and listen.<br/><br/>This is a companion thread to <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14448" rel="nofollow">history of silencing people of color and women</a>. In the previous thread, women and people of color who feel welcomed here wanted a thread to share their positive experiences with Story Games. <br/><br/>The goal of this thread is NOT to prove, disprove, provide evidence, or hold court. And please note, positive experiences shared here do not invalidate negative experiences shared in the other thread. <br/><br/><b>RULES: </b><br/><br/><b>1. If you are a women or a person of color and feel Story Games has been welcoming</b>, please let us know. Either post here or if you want to remain anonymous, whisper or email me at jenskot AT gmail DOT com so I can post your thoughts while keeping your identity and specific names anonymous.<br/><br/>Feel free to post as little or as much as you want. It's cool to just say, "I feel welcome at Story Games". And it is cool to go into more detail explaining why you feel this way or sharing experiences you've had here. Whatever you're comfortable with. <br/><br/><b>2. Don't respond to other people's posts.</b> Consider this more a poll than a discussion. If you want to say something that may not be appropriate in this thread, please send a whisper or start a new thread.<br/><br/><b>3. If you DO NOT feel that Story Games is welcoming to women or people or color</b>, that's totally cool but please don't post to this thread. Instead, please <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14448" rel="nofollow">post to this thread</a>.<br/><br/><b>4. If you are not a woman or person of color </b>, that's totally cool but please don't post to this thread. Instead, feel free to whisper me if you have questions or start a new thread. <br/><br/>My first reaction when someone tells me not to post somewhere because of my demographics, is usually frustration, hurt, or anger. It's natural and completely understandable. But please note, I care about your opinion and I don't want to silence you. All I want to do is make this specific and limited thread safe for specific people who might not post otherwise. Imagine I started a "please tell me 3 reasons why I should buy Dogs in the Vineyard" and most of the replies were "don't" or "buy this other game instead". That would be frustrating, and situations like those have caused people who do have an on topic opinion to simply give up and stop posting all together. That said, I would be happy if you started a new thread sharing your opinions. I want to hear them. No one here is better than anyone else. This isn't about that.<br/><br/><b>5. Stay on topic</b>. <br/><br/><b>6. If you have questions about this thread or comments about the rules</b>, whisper me. <br/><br/><b>MODERATION:</b>.<br/><br/><b> Andy has given me permission to moderate this thread. </b> If the above rules are not followed, I will turn the post in question into a whisper (so the post isn't visible but also not deleted) and contact those involved to resolve any issues quickly, definitively and respectfully. In the majority of situations where I've had to moderate a post, I turn it into a whisper, contact the poster, they make a few edits, and then we make the post public again. Generally it's been a gentle and fair process but my preference is not to have to moderate anything at all. Please help me keep this thread moderation free by following the above rules and if there are any questions, please whisper me. <br/><br/>Thanks so much,<br/>John                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329268/#Comment_329268" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-12T16:52:52+00:00" title="June 12, 2011  4:52PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2011 4:54PM by anansigirl.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, I'm a woman.<br/><br/>I've felt so overwhelmingly welcome at Storygames I was surprised there were people who felt unwelcome. I feel as though people here are really helpful, engaging, creative and supportive of people of all types, genders, orientations, races, nationalities. I think that makes this place really unique and I really value the feedback I get here about any question I have, no matter how noobish or dorky or trad or ridiculous it is.<br/><br/>I don't feel judged or attacked because of my gender on here. I was worried at first because most places I have been online that have to do with gaming are very immature and anti-girl (check out fat, ugly or slutty for hilarious examples). I have seen rare instances of race and gender being discussed here maturely. I don't think I've EVER had my gender even brought up except for when I make it a case to shout it out in some feminist thread or other.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think its important to say. I always have an awesome Storygames experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_329422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329422/#Comment_329422" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T12:34:36+00:00" title="June 13, 2011 12:34PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, I'm an ambiguously ethnic guy.

I don't feel silenced (I feel pretty hard to silence in general).<br/>To echo Daniel, though, I'm pretty picky about the threads I engage on (on any forum!).<br/>And I don't think people would know I am a lady just by my handle. So there is that.<br/><br/>This site discusses the games I am playing and subjects around them that interest me, vagina or no.
