Once per session I run, usually.<br/><br/>A lighter version that would work great with any WoD are two simple ones:<br/><br/>1) "What is your character thinking right now?" Do this in a tense situation, might give the player a chance to express something that might not be coming out through their roleplaying.<br/><br/>2) Another is, "What are they thinking right now?" Do that one after one of the character drops a line on an NPC, ask them what the NPC thinks about what they just said, or how they react.<br/><br/>But in play, it might be things like:<br/><br/>(you're roleplaying a scene where a vampire character is talking to her informant. The conversation is winding down.<br/>"Suddenly, your informant mentions something about the Lacea Sanctum that totally catches you off guard. What does he say?"<br/><br/>Remember, too, that the GM (at least IMO) should have "veto power" over it. You're basically giving the player some narrative authority: Try to follow their idea and implement it, even if it's counter to your immediate plans. You might find a way to work it in. Also, give the player a little to think, like 5-10 seconds.<br/><br/>However, if what they come up with just totally is uh.. for lack of a better word, "dumb" (I'm thinking "an idea that disrupts the game, breaks the mood", etc) feel free to ask them to come up with something else, or just take the narration back and move on.<br/>Like:<br/>GM: "Suddenly, your informant mentions something about the Lacea Sanctum that totally catches you off guard. What does he say?"<br/>Player: "Uh... he mentions the name of a Lacea Sanctum member, but it's also the member of a friend I had a few centuries ago."<br/>::Cool::<br/><br/>GM: "Suddenly, your informant mentions something about the Lacea Sanctum that totally catches you off guard. What does he say?"<br/>Player: "Hmmm. He makes an offhand remark about how the Lacea Sanctum are planning something big tonight at the cathedral during mass.<br/>::Cool::<br/><br/>(in a game where the players are trying to defeat an evil version of the Lacea Sanctum in their city, where they are the biggest threat and the ?main antagonists" of the campaign)<br/>GM: "Suddenly, your informant mentions something about the Lacea Sanctum that totally catches you off guard. What does he say?"<br/>Player: "... He says that the Lacea Sanctum all plan to leave town tomorrow. The prince is going to commit suicide by jumping outside during the daytime.<br/>::...Not Cool, player's probably just being a dick.::<br/><br/>Make sense? There's so many things you can do with Fishing.<br/><br/>"As you enter the library, there's something about it that doesn't seem right. (ask player) What about this library is just *wrong*?"<br/><br/>"The books on his desk are old and weathered. However, one book particularly catches your attention. Which book is it, and why is that book important to you?"<br/><br/>etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196156/#Comment_196156" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-08T04:38:33+00:00" title="March  8, 2009  4:38AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Omar, Andy's advice is good.<br/><br/>You know that thing you do, as a GM, where you make things up on the spur of the moment? The basic level of fishing, I think, is letting the players make things up instead:<br/><br/><i>GM: OK, I think it'd be more interesting if you'd seen this guy before. Where have you seen him?<br/>Player: Maybe in the opium den?<br/>GM: Yeah, he's an opium fiend, let's go with that.</i><br/><br/>So, basically, you're just passing some of your GM storytelling responsibilities over to the players.<br/><br/>And then there's an advanced level, where you use those questions deliberately to generate creative answers from the players.<br/><br/><i>GM: So he gives you something valuable. What is it?<br/>Player: A jewelled dagger?<br/>GM: What's special about it?<br/>Player: It's a heirloom?<br/>GM: Yeah, this is a family heirloom, and he's returning it to you.</i><br/><br/>You were asking about other techniques you could use. You could try passing some of your Storyteller responsibilities over to the players. In particular, let them describe the world, which would be <i>great</i> in the World of Darkness: "OK, so where's this dive bar? What does it look like?".<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196158/#Comment_196158" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-08T05:16:13+00:00" title="March  8, 2009  5:16AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read about a game once where fishing was part of character generation.

Fishing is best used sparingly, only when you think a situation will really be improved by it.  Too many questions and you'll ruin the flow of the game, or annoy the players, or just plain have too many answers to keep track of.<br/><br/>As a side note, fishing is not the end-all, be-all of techniques.  If it's not working -- the players aren't enjoying it, you're not enjoying it, the answers you're getting aren't useful or are simply not paying off and making the game more fun, whatever -- then don't worry about it.  Don't think you did something wrong and that you have to keep trying it until you get it right, because not every game and/or gaming group actually benefits from it.  It's a fairly specialized tool, and sometimes you just don't need it to get the job done.<br/><br/><br/>Another technique which works really well in most WoD games is to keep your NPC list short.  Don't invent a new NPC for everything -- first, see if you can use one of the NPCs already in your game to fill that role.<br/><br/>Not only will this help you keep the story tighter, it will also give everyone more reasons to interact with those NPCs, and let them build their own web of connections with them.  WoD games really sing when you're doing lots of social things, and especially so when the players genuinely have a sense of personal history with the NPCs they deal with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196165/#Comment_196165" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-08T08:41:45+00:00" title="March  8, 2009  8:41AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>especially the "once per session" part.

Give people an "extra oomph" outcome when the roll is better than the system allows to reflect mechanically or the system's mechanical benefit is moot in this instance (e.g., the critical hit when any hit was going to be enough at this point, the 2 successes in dice pool over and above the # of successes needed for best outcome), and say "cool, not only does that work but if you want to you can define something now" or hand out a "token" that can used to do that later a la Fate Points etc.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196182/#Comment_196182" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-08T13:39:45+00:00" title="March  8, 2009  1:39PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honor your players' flags.

So I'll discuss fishing in the context I'm used to using it, and y'all can draw your own conclusions.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, my personal concept of the technique is more than just asking the player to add some details, it's more like, umm... let's say "guided player input." In other words, I don't give players carte blanche to describe whatever they want. I ask for a specific type of input. I try not to ask overly vague or open ended questions, like, "Describe this room for me." Rather, I ask specific or qualified questions, like, "there's an object in this room that doesn't seem to belong, what is it?". I also view fishing fairly broadly, such that it can include any sort of player input. For example, something I've done in the past is ask players to frame a dream sequence for their character.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, know that in tMW, players create their backstory and stuff during play. So I generally use fishing to try and get flag-y type of information from the player, or to otherwise give the scene a personal connection to the character/player. I don't ask questions that can be turned on another character/player, like, "the ghost starts speaking, who does he speak to, player A?" Rather, I tend to direct the question to a specific character, like, "Player A, the ghost starts to speak to you, what does he say?" As such, I purposesly put players on the spot. Often, I use fishing when a player isn't foreshadowing their Fate or otherwise giving me content to work with.<br/>\n<br/>\nRelatedly to the above, I tend to use fishing more towards the beginning of the game, while the players are still trying to figure out who their characters are and what they want. During the back half of the game, after I start to get a sense of a player's flags, I don't use the technique so much. I prefer to just frame a situation around a player's flags directly myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs others have suggested, I also use the technique fairly sparingly, at least in regard to any one player. I don't usually ask for more than one detail per scene. And even if I'm I'm fishing for input every other scene or so, I make sure to ask someone different every time. I usually only ask the same player once or twice, but I make sure to get info from all the players in one way or another. (But I'll make a point here---in tMW, players have the explicit ability to add details themselves, so GM fishing starts becoming redundent after a certain point when players start adding details on their own.)<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, a word of caution---players never answer the way you expect, so don't use the technique if you're not prepared to trash your prep work and improvise the scene! In tMW, ideally the players create <i>all</i> (significant) dramatic content, the GM just follows their lead. So fishing is just a natural extension of that principle. I'm leery of the idea of fishing as some sort of universal GM tool. Don't use the technique if you don't want to start giving the players that type of overt "directorial" control. (But I don't use the technique outside of tMW really, so take that last bit with a grain of salt.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
