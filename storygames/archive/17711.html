I'm working on a game using AW and I've got a decent handle on what's going on with it. Even so, seeing everything broken down like that is helpful. I'm planning on drifting some of those rules, and seeing them laid out gives me the confidence that I can at least try the changes because they won't be terribly off-base.<br/><br/>One of the strengths of AW is how procedural it is. Ex: You do this, then. Now, you do this. It spells everything out for you to play the kind of game that it is. That breakdown is the same way. Where things get interesting is when you deliberately decide to change something beyond the listed parameters. Things could go well, or break totally, and the only way to find out is to play.

For example, in Apocalypse World, you're following around capable, hot, bad asses. The focus is on the messy relationships between the characters and the scarcities that create friction among the PC's and the NPC's. In Dungeon World, your following around capable, adventurous, bad asses. The focus is on exploring the dungeon and surviving the encounters you have in that dungeon. The rules are tailored to each focus. The two different focuses seem to create very different experiences for different people.<br/><br/>Check out <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/17329/world-of-dungeons-dungeon-girls/p1" rel="nofollow">Hexabolic's Dungeon Girls</a>!

TerrorForm (my current project) has some thematic and genre similarities to AW, but there are also some big differences. Those differences have me focusing on different parts of the rules to highlight the genre elements that I want to highlight. It's very cool that this set of rules allows that. Many different sets of rules are flexible, but I don't know that I've encountered one that's as flexible as AW.<br/><br/>Still, I do think there is a "core" as it pertains to the construction of moves and the like. Yes, the genre will serve to highlight different aspects of the rules, but the rolling of dice, the cascading moves, all of that has to remain at the heart of what's going on or you're using a different set of rules altogether.

But what I'm saying is that that there's nothing essential about that "core" - it will change depending on who's using it for what purpose, and those "altogether different" systems are still part of the unfolding conversation. Some hacks are closer to AW, some are less so, but that has nothing to do with some kind of transcendental pure-essence of the system. It's a tangled web of influence and appropriation. If you're going to build a taxonomy, follow the hacks themselves and "play to see what happens" rather than imposing an imaginary fixed centre to the web.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401195/#Comment_401195" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-18T16:29:10+00:00" title="December 18, 2012  4:29PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Definitely take a look at this: <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/simple-world/" rel="nofollow">Simple World</a></blockquote>\nThat's just awesome!

The very first time i heard about it,  i just didn't saw the point. Then, i had a closer look to the playbooks and i immediatly saw how it work throught the moves. And it was really all that i was expecting, the kind of games who'd bring me back to RPG.<br/><br/>i started talking about it with the future translator (who has already made a non official translation) during the Vieux Pots contest. We both agree the system had a potential for newbies and non (or formers) gamers, if it were in a box, with all the stugg ready to play. Finally, we ended working together on the boxed version of Dungeon World in french (<a href="http://fr.ulule.com/dungeon-world-vf/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://fr.ulule.com/dungeon-world-vf/</a>)<br/><br/>So, from my point of view, the main difference between AW and DW is that DW has a more pre-established structure than AW (ie: something <i>closer </i>to a scenario), throught the Dungeon itself (places and what's there). In the french version, we've tried to give it a format close the fronts (ie: not a "literary" format as for a normal scenario)<br/><br/>I've also had a close look on Tremulus before the ransom, thanks to Sean, and i think it have the same kind of alteration (i love the hazard track). I heard told about a metaplot system in monsterheart, but i don't know about it.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
