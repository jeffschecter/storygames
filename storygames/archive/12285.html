A little trade off to be made every time you pick up the dice.  Nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe use of wagers for extra facts doesn't click with me though.  My character finds a favored concubine dead on the floor.  Roll my cunning to find clues.  O K.  I can give inconsequential facts -- her hair is brown -- but that's either kind of boring.  Maybe my facts are more of a challenge to the others at the table to try to make sense of them -- her hair is brown though it is usually black.    That's seems better, but after just a few we probably have a messy tangle w/o no-one having any idea how to tie it back together.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think it is that I don't trust my fellow players, but it seems like having the game work out depends on us all being on the same mental wave length about our story before we play the story.

This quite literally happened in the Houses game I played in.<br/><br/>However, if it's a friendly game, you're more interested in creating a compelling story than one-upping each other. And, suddenly, you're riffing off each other's facts and building a narrative. <br/><br/>I prefer to go with the inconsequential facts that might spur something more interesting down the line. Is her hair brown? I don't know... But, it turns out she WAS pregnant though. Pregnant aye? Well, my wager is that she also has a locket with the initials M.J. on them. Hmmm... Those are the initials of our Daimyo. Or, whatever. Now all of a sudden, there's suspicion our Daimyo might have been visiting this concubine and possibly even impregnated her. Did he? I don't know. What does it mean if he did? <br/><br/>Sometimes it's good to have an idea of what direction you want to take the story in, but sometimes you just gotta wing it. The key is to make those truths able to be riffed off of, or be a seed for a future use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275382/#Comment_275382" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-10T13:06:58+00:00" title="June 10, 2010  1:06PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2010 1:08PM by Jesse.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a lot about Houses of the Blooded I don't get.<br/><br/>However, the wager stuff I DO get.<br/><br/>You wouldn't use a Cunning wager to say "her hair is brown."  You would use it to link elements of the story.  Like you would use a Wager to say, "She has a tattoo that is the banner of Baron Isla Mwrr!"  Or "The dagger in her back is unmistakably of Fox craftsmanship!" if you want to point in less specific direction.  (Oops, my examples are Houses of the Blooded bent but I assume the same applies to Blood and Honor).<br/><br/>Also, it's totally possible to implicate connections to other players and have that not be a competitive act.

That unless we have some initial agreement on the story it will just spin away into multiple branching plots as people push the plots they want, and follow-up on ideas tossed out by others, and occasionally just toss out ideas that seem cool w/o knowing where the ideas might lead.  Which could be a Twin Peaks kind of fun, but seems like it might get frustrating fast.

I might see some value in appointing someone a "scribe" of the game to keep track of declared facts that are created during a session, and to speak up when you draw near them.

It does a noir-style detective story with ZERO prep and no-one at the table knowing who did it or why.  It inverts the basic RPG setup.  You have one player who is the Investigator and everyone else rotates turns as the Authority who basically GMs one scene.  I've now played this game about a dozen games and in some cases with total strangers.  I've had strong games.  I've had weak games.  I've never had a gonzo makes no sense game.  Not once.<br/><br/>You might want to check it out as it applies this "build a mystery" principle in a much smaller narrower environment.  However, a lot of the same social principles apply to Houses of the Blooded.<br/><br/>Oh and sometimes you have to play unsafe.  If one person introduces something they thought was a clever reversal and someone else is "meh" about it.  The person who introduced it holds the power.  Maybe he retracts it because he see's it's not flying.  But maybe he's really committed to it.  It's his wager.  His input.  The "meh" player needs to be willing to roll with it.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275423">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275423/#Comment_275423" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-10T18:11:56+00:00" title="June 10, 2010  6:11PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 10, 2010 6:12PM by JDCorley.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Doug Bonar</cite>I think that's part of the problem.

The successful implementations do not make you answer the question of "how do I win this situation using three facts" or the question of "how do I protagonize my character using three facts", simply because facts by themselves are meaningless: as has already been mentioned, the mere facts can always be undermined by further facts, and nothing needs to actually mean anything for the game unless the players give it credence and respect the facts as dramatically significant. This will not happen when the facts you introduce into the game are perceived not as interesting or credible, but rather merely opportunistic. The very best outcome you can hope for superficial and fictionally unexciting facts is that the other players ignore them; the worse outcome is that they'll actively attack your contribution with the fact economy. How do you force the other players to <i>care</i> that it was Bob's dagger and reincorporate the fact into their play? The answer is that you don't, and thus the fact economy by itself has done nothing for your creative participation in the game.<br/><br/>Donjon is a good example of explicitly adversial fact economy. I think that I'm not stating anything controversial if I say that the game tends towards comedic, chaotic, incoherent fiction that mostly gains virtue from a shared creative understanding between the players; the fact economy of the game works fine as long as everybody follows the unstated rules of good behaviour and do not overreach, do not undermine the contributions of the others. In this regard the game resembles Once Upon a Time a lot.<br/><br/>What, then, is the effective way of using fact economies? My experience is that the fact economy in <i>Universalis</i> sucks if you try to fight other players via it: "No, actually an even larger elephant suddenly appears." or "What seemed like character A was actually character B in disguise!" are pure undermining of whatever situation might have been developing; continuous undermining of any constructive efforts and refusal to commit to the fictional situation as it is leads to nothing more than a shallow form of parlor narration. Universalis, for it to work correctly, needs you to step back, accept the facts on the ground when they've been sufficiently established, and play some conflicts now and then instead of trying to force your own agenda on the game by introducing more and more facts.<br/><br/>The more functional approach is explicitly coded into the rules of <i>Spione</i>: in that game the fact economy is used as a carefully metered reward and dramatic pacing devise. The rules explicitly separate facts that are allowed to be undermined from finalized facts, for instance, and fact-setting is so valuable and done so irregularly that the players are naturally driven to resolve dramatic tension by the use of those facts. Thus no fact wars are waged, as the players lack ammunition and important facts get cemented out of reach as certainties as play progresses. The fact that this resembles the way narration-sharing conflict resolution games handle the narration sharing is not a coincidence. Most importantly, the players are not in symmetric character-playing relationships with each other, and therefore do not have pure oneupmanship motivations driving their play; rather, a cooperative spirit permeates the whole thing due to the specific roles the different players take towards the central characters of the game. The end result of all this is that the facts in Spione are not actually "facts" in the all-inclusive way normally used in fact-setting games; rather, they're just a right to resolve dramatic issues interpreted through the lens of certain and uncertain information, as befits a spy game. The only kind of "fact" that game includes is the kind that resolves drama.<br/><br/>How to implement these principles in HoB and such games? I'd say that a firm GM adjudication of the use of the fact economy would be a good thing: have the GM make clear that frivolousness will be ostracized and undermining of facts with other facts is not allowed. Winnow the constructive uses of facts from the destructive mercilessly. It's a crutch, I admit, but then I don't really get how else you're going to use an ultra-generic narration sharing mechanism like that for satisfactory dramatic play; just like Donjon, it's going to fall into chaotic comedy (or mere frivolousness) unless the group establishes a shared creative accord to regulate the mechanical principle. The difficulty is that without tools such an accord will by necessity be fiat-driven and/or implicit; you just have to feel what types of narration the other players will expect and like. I'm sure that it gets easier with an extended campaign as the players learn to know each other's preferences.<br/><br/>(Those who've had successful play with HoB shouldn't feel that I'm pissing in your morning cereal here. I completely believe that the shared creative accord mentioned above is not impossible to establish. It's just an illusion to think that the wager mechanics of the game will <i>help</i> with this task. Either you get there and are thus able to use these mechanics without constant fighting, or you don't, in which case those mechanics are a great way for the players to disrupt the game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doug%20Bonar" title="Doug Bonar"><img alt="Doug Bonar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doug%20Bonar">Doug Bonar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275480/#Comment_275480" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T05:06:23+00:00" title="June 11, 2010  5:06AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Eero.

I say "merely" because many people playing a game like HoB might not be interested in engaging in linguistic sophistry organically intermingled with the texture of the fiction. (Some might, I recognize.) Just consider: if a group really thinks that the limits of fair play reside in the exact semantics of the statement "It's Bob's dagger that killed the guy!", then it stands to reason that the way to <i>defend</i> the meaningfulness of your statements lies in careful phrasing of the same: you can't in fact just say what the characters see or what the universal audience sees or anything like that as commonly seen in rpg narration; you'll have to use your facts efficiently to fight the semantic challenges posed to them. "It's Bob's dagger with Bob's fingerprints on it." is a stronger statement that counteracts the possible counter-argument you presented, for example. If we allow the play to devolve into this level, we're engaging in sophistry that many won't find at all pleasing as a play experience - they're there to play an imaginary game and not engage in outwitting the opposition, after all.<br/><br/>Furthermore, that same legalistic rigidity acts in the opposite direction as well: if we deem that "It's Bob's dagger." is to be interpreted strictly as a factual statement within its own semantics, we <i>have</i> to conclude that the only way to introduce the "Ah hah, the dagger was a counterfeit after all!" twist is to state thusly from the off-set: "It's a counterfeit of Bob's dagger." would set up this particular plotline quite nicely, but then it's all preloaded into the statement - isn't that just a little bit dull? Wouldn't it be more exciting if you didn't try to preload the plot twist (revealing it to everybody at the same time, note), but rather could just say what the things <i>seem</i> like at the moment? Should you say that "It seems like Bob's dagger, but maybe it's not, after all?" Talk about foreshadowing...<br/><br/>To me it seems obvious that the narrative tool people are looking for in fact currency mechanics usually is the ability to input dramatic content and have it acknowledged, respected and incorporated by the other players. There is no shortcut into this, and carefully phrasing your one fact to make it inescapably meaningful will inevitably fail if the willingness to acknowledge it is not present in the rest of the group. For this reason the real meaning in "It's Bob's dagger!" is probably not going to be merely literal: what the player wants to <i>achieve</i> by introducing this fact is to cast doubt on Bob's allegiance, motivate Bob to action by proving his innocense, introduce the idea that Bob really might be the murderer... all fine goals, but the important thing to realize is that those are all going to get undermined if the other players aren't reading your contribution and appreciating it for these possibilities it presents. Merely being very literal in reading the fact for meaning won't do anything to ensure that your fact will <i>matter</i>.<br/><br/>Or, to put the same in a nutshell: does it bother you if the facts you introduce get ignored and everybody instead hares off in random directions as per the supposition in the OP? The reason for that has nothing to do with the fact mechanics and their application, but rather with a lack of creative consideration for the facts that the players introduce. If a game doesn't have any tools that enforce or encourage such consideration, then it's up to the group to get to that level of cooperation on their own. I'm reminded of <i>Zombie Cinema</i>, which actually has its own form of fact currency in the shifting scene framing turns the game features: the only thing preventing these scene frames the players provide from haring off into directions unknown is ultimately the internalized cinematic experience of the players combined with the purpose the players have in framing the scenes. If we remove the coordination provided by the shared genre understanding, we get a very similar system to the one HoB has in that there is nothing in particular ensuring that the players frame scenes that actually build upon what came before in a meaningful manner.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275525/#Comment_275525" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T08:58:56+00:00" title="June 11, 2010  8:58AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>How do you force the other players to<i>care</i>that it was Bob's dagger and reincorporate the fact into their play?</blockquote>\nThrough play?

Sure, certain facts channel play in certain directions, so players have some input into what the game is about, but it doesn't help anyone guide play anywhere. It's just, "Okay, right turn here!

Where are we going?"<br/><br/>It's John Wick's prerogative what he does, but it's kind of disappointing to me that he's recycling the Houses system when Houses itself is still so buggy (which is true even if the facts thing works for you--there're other bugs in there).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275619/#Comment_275619" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T14:45:13+00:00" title="June 11, 2010  2:45PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's certainly true that some people instinctively grab onto the wager/fact thing as being what the game's all about, but it's not really.

Specifically, it seems to me that were I to play the game, I wouldn't normally touch the wagers with a ten-foot pole; using that sort of power doesn't seem to mesh with the normal player agenda very well, so it would be strictly exceptional for me to step out of character to do some wagering. This is especially true with the rules as they're set up - you don't get wagers as a side-profit of success, but rather you have to actively hamper your chances of success to gain wagers. Seems like a lose-lose to me from the character viewpoint, when I can just put everything into having the character succeed in what he's trying to do.<br/><br/>(Of course the standard reply to that is that the GM has to fuck with you with the conditions and consequences if you don't control them with wagers yourself. I don't find this particularly problematic; either the GM is a fuckwit or he's just providing me with good antagonism, which he should be doing anyway. I guess it all comes down to whether wagers are supposed to be used to help your own character win or to complicate the lives of other characters or to even complicate the life of your own character.

Both myself and players have used wagers in the exact same circumstance to make the "find a body" details both compelling and game changing. Some have used wagers to make the body a prominent, beloved and/or hated NPC. "The body is my wife," for example. Or, "the body is our Count."

You must trust your fellow players. Wagers do not give you permission to make "inconsequential" changes.

That's just pretty complex, as you need to choose between playing for accomplishment for your own character, playing for dramatic interest for your own character and playing for adversity (or even accomplishment) for some other player's interests. Leaving this wide open provides absolute freedom of expression, but also the potential for dissonance and confused communication when players don't understand or appreciate each other's goals in playing the way they do. This might not be a problem for some, but I feel like I need more purpose for what I do in play instead of just doing "whatever I want".<br/><br/>I guess that the key question is the one I always strive to answer when reading a new game: why do I play this character in this game? What am I trying to accomplish, what is my task here? Why do I care? In many games it's the true and tested advocation task that I have to execute, and I know that I'm interested in that and want to play many different characters for whom I make choices in various situations. In HoB this is not nearly as clear-cut as some things like the wagers seem to be left up in the air if I just simplistically assume that the game works within my own natural purview of interest: if I'm merely concerned about playing my character, expressing him powerfully and waiting for the game process to provide me situations, I never have any reason to use the wager mechanic. Using the wagers to "win" won't work for me because I want my character to win or lose by his own virtues and not because I manipulated the situation to be such that he wins. Using the wagers to cause complications for anybody seems similarly arbitrary - I guess I could do it if the GM was being lazy and I needed to provide adversity for some other player, but it'd be pretty weird to do that through a currency attached to my character instead of working more generally, like GM in his adversity-providing role normally does.<br/><br/>My thinking upthread was that if I understood better why and when you're supposed to use the wager rules, that'd help me also shape an useful mindset for playing the game, for figuring out what I'm supposed to be doing to be a constructive participant in the game. I can easily imagine how "do anything you feel like doing" might be the answer with this game text, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick" title="John Wick"><img alt="John Wick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick">John Wick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276188/#Comment_276188" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-15T13:01:03+00:00" title="June 15, 2010  1:01PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite> Leaving this wide open provides absolute freedom of expression, but also the potential for dissonance and confused communication when players don't understand or appreciate each other's goals in playing the way they do.</blockquote>\nSo... don't play with those people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doug%20Bonar" title="Doug Bonar"><img alt="Doug Bonar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doug%20Bonar">Doug Bonar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276190/#Comment_276190" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-15T13:03:31+00:00" title="June 15, 2010  1:03PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Wick</cite><b>"The use of wagers for extra facts doesn't click with me though.

Both myself and players have used wagers in the exact same circumstance to make the "find a body" details both compelling and game changing. Some have used wagers to make the body a prominent, beloved and/or hated NPC. "The body is my wife," for example. Or, "the body is our Count."

I think that I derive a lot of value out of game texts that can unify and direct the group's creative passions (or help the GM do so!) too, though. But it is possible to punt these issues to the particular people playing the game, as surely they'll be able to come to a concord and use the game they've been given as a basis for what they will build themselves. They can talk about it, learn each other's interests by experience or even just not play with people who don't match immediately.<br/><br/>My own problem with that sort of rpg text has for the last decade has been basically that I've become a bit lazy about the whole creative thing, expecting the game I choose to carry more of the burden in convincing me to play, and convincing me to play in the way advocated by the game text. But that's just a preference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276207/#Comment_276207" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-15T14:00:20+00:00" title="June 15, 2010  2:00PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2010 2:00PM by Jesse.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>My own problem with that sort of rpg text has for the last decade has been basically that I've become a bit lazy about the whole creative thing, expecting the game I choose to carry more of the burden in convincing me to play, and convincing me to play in the way advocated by the game text.</blockquote>\nEero,<br/><br/>My phrase for this lately is, "I want to play the game.

Let me see if I can ofter some more practical advice.  This is going to get kind of academic.  I suspect John will want to strangle me.<br/><br/>Okay for purposes of this discussion I'm going to offer a definition of "Story."  PLEASE don't get caught up in arguing about this definition.  I'm just offering it here to contextualize what I'm about to say.  Story is the *development* and *resolution* of a situation that engages an external audience.<br/><br/>So you'll notice there's kind of two phases there.  Subtle point 1) there's a lot of back and forth, overlap and grey areas between the two.  Subtle point 2) some story formats have LOTS of overlap because they actually consist of multiple stories.  Soap Operas work this way.  While one story is resolving another is beginning to develop.  My point is that there's not necessarily a hard line down the middle through the two phases.<br/><br/>I would suggest that in a functional, creatively attentive group Wagers are used two different ways across the two phases.  During the development phase Wagers are used primarily to create situation elements and to tie situation elements together.  I would suggest that Cunning and Wisdom are used a lot fairly early in Houses game.<br/><br/>At some point that situation hits creative critical mass and play switches over to mostly being about resolving the situation.  I would suggest that Cunning and Wisdom begin to see decreased use (at least for purposes of raw external fact creation) and the other Virtues become more prominent with Cunning taking a dramatic shift from raw observation to calculated action.<br/><br/>When that happens the game works relatively well.  My personal complaint is that there aren't a lot of tools in the game to keep that process on track and so you have to more or less "manually" (for lack of a better term) avoid some pitfalls.<br/><br/>Pitfall 1: Under development in the development phase.  If the GM comes with TOO much pre-developed, aggressively wagering PCs will walk all over his hard work.  If the GM under-estimates the degree to which the players are willing to participate in situation development via the wager system then he has no ground to walk on.  The game will stall under these conditions.<br/><br/>Pitfall 2: Never switching phases.  The game basically stays in development mode and the players get caught up in adding more and more detail without ever actually doing anything about it.  Basically creating an elaborate, maybe even interesting portrait that never actually moves.  A variant of this is when some players switch phases and some do not.  Such that the the players who are still creatively in the development phase being introducing things that feel too complex or incongruent for the players who have creatively entered the resolution phase.<br/><br/>Pitfall 3: NPC Theater.  Some players will get caught up in orchestrating the lives of the NPCs to the point that they never have their own character do anything.  They will basically jigger things so that the GM (or the rest of the players) are forced into telling a story for their amusement.  In an extreme case the player figures out how to jigger NPC rivalries and relationships such that his own character can get what he wants without actually ever having to raise a finger.<br/><br/>On top of that the game is long-form.  That actually makes identifying the end of the "resolution" phase kind of difficult.  WHEN is a given story over?  My general creative guidelines is that all PCs have resolved personal crises such that they would have to re-write significant portions of their character concept to fully participate in another story.  There is WAY too much going on in a Houses game to use that bench mark.  The Romance system alone lasts whole SEASONS there is NO WAY you will resolve all the issues tied up in a Romance in a single story.  So identifying and picking a marker for "this story is over" is troublesome as their will likely be A LOT of dangling personal issues for the PCs unresolved.<br/><br/>But the general principle is relatively simple.<br/><br/>Early wagers are used to introduce situational elements and create ties to them.  Later wagers are used to resolve the conflicts inherent in that situation.<br/><br/>But that basic through-line is kind of difficult to manage within the scope and breadth of Houses.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276223/#Comment_276223" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-15T15:13:14+00:00" title="June 15, 2010  3:13PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2010 3:14PM by JDCorley.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think those are good insights, Jesse.  Here is how they've resolved in my (admittedly limited) experience:<br/><br/>First of all, this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>I would suggest that in a functional, creatively attentive group Wagers are used two different ways across the two phases.

This is crucial stuff, and yes, that's how it works in play.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Pitfall 1: Under development in the development phase.  If the GM comes with TOO much pre-developed, aggressively wagering PCs will walk all over his hard work.  If the GM under-estimates the degree to which the players are willing to participate in situation development via the wager system then he has no ground to walk on.  The game will stall under these conditions.</blockquote>\nThe advice I remember from the GM section (and remember, it's been a while since I read it) is that the GM is to incrementally provide material until the player-provided material begins to be sufficiently developed to react to. In other words, you don't necessarily have to guess in advance how much you have to prepare, you just have to be actively listening for the moment when the players go "oh, I get it" and being willing to toss your plans out the window after that point. In addition, the advice for developing situations as a GM and as a player are more or less identical, though the mechanics are different.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Pitfall 2: Never switching phases.  The game basically stays in development mode and the players get caught up in adding more and more detail without ever actually doing anything about it.  Basically creating an elaborate, maybe even interesting portrait that never actually moves.  A variant of this is when some players switch phases and some do not.  Such that the the players who are still creatively in the development phase being introducing things that feel too complex or incongruent for the players who have creatively entered the resolution phase.</blockquote>\nI think this is just a "learn to play" moment.  You're right, it's a pitfall. The first time I played, I was still developing and other people were putting knives to my throat already and I was like "wha? what is happening, are you not even listening to me?"  But making that shift in emphasis is something that you note correctly has to happen.  I think each group is going to signal that emphasis differently.  However, there are distinct advantages to being the first guy to poison someone else, so I don't think "getting stuck" is a permanent condition. Once things start to go over the edge, they fall fast.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Pitfall 3: NPC Theater.  Some players will get caught up in orchestrating the lives of the NPCs to the point that they never have their own character do anything.

Also note that PCs are extremely effective.  If you're looking for the most effective way to develop/resolve your character's goals, the actual character themself is likely to be one of the best tools in your toolbelt.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>On top of that the game is long-form.  That actually makes identifying the end of the "resolution" phase kind of difficult.  WHEN is a given story over?</blockquote>\nWell, this is more running into the walls of your definition than anything else.  In any sort of soap opera or other long running drama, it's not a "story" that's over, but instead, the development and resolution of a particular situation.  John takes over the hospital from kindly old Mary or he doesn't.  Bill and Sally run off and get married, or they don't.

The Narrator plays all the NPCs, so it's obvious the Narrator determines the actions and decisions of the Daimyo.<br/><br/>But, the fact someone needed to ask that question--that the answer to that question was not self-evident--said a lot to me about how people read and play my games.<br/><br/>I say this on the heels of Jesse's comment about Cunning and Wisdom providing the setup for stories and the other Virtues providing the resolution. While I find that distinction just a little false, there's a lot of truth to it, as well. It is certainly easier to establish facts than resolve conflicts with Cunning and Wisdom. And, of course, it's a lot easier to resolve conflicts with Strength and Prowess.<br/><br/>I've been learning a lot from this process.

I tried playing the game TWICE.  Pitfall <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> sank the first and Pitfall <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> + Pitfall <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> sank the second.<br/><br/>The first game I was playing 1 on 1.  I fully expected Cunning and Wisdom wagers to drive most of the first half the game.  So all I really came with was that the PC was visited in a dream by one of the Suaven she worshiped to warn her that her cousin was in terrible danger.  What proceeded was that the player never ONCE asked to *look* for anything (Cunning) nor asked what about what she already *knew* (Wisdom).  Instead what she did was do 100% of her action through questioning NPCs.  Since the GM has full control over what an NPC says and does I was stuck having to weave everything from full cloth until I just collapsed from exhaustion because I had no real situation.<br/><br/>The second time I tried playing the game I had two players.  This time I sent them into a unified situation: a Wedding.  I had a cast of about six NPCs with "three things true" and some back up motivations for them.  In some cases I had "dangling" true things like, "There is something odd about the Baroness's wedding gift" in the hopes of *prodding* Cunning rolls.<br/><br/>That sort of worked but the result was NPC Theater.  The players used Wisdom and Cunning wagers to create and imply motives that angled the NPCs at each other rather than roping themselves in.  Since character creation doesn't generate any concrete goals or values for the PCs, the players had nothing to pursue and I had nothing to threaten.  So they used wagers to weave a little drama among the NPCs.  Again, I collapse from exhaustion.<br/><br/>Jesse<br/><br/>P.S. It is my diagnosis that Situation generation is the most underdeveloped part of Houses both for the Tabletop and for the LARP.  The one time I played the LARP, I really had no way to engage the game because I had no way of identifying anything resembling Situation.  What were the conflicts at hand?  What required my character's action?  What do all the other characters care about?  What was the evenings main point of tension?  I had an Enemy but... not much in the way of tools to develop that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276251/#Comment_276251" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-15T19:19:43+00:00" title="June 15, 2010  7:19PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Well, this is more running into the walls of your definition than anything else.

I'm not a fan of long form storytelling.  Anyone who knows me well, will tell you that.  I don't like long form TV and I don't like book series or comic lines.  I like my narratives punchy, focused and to the point.  John's recent experience with LOST is a textbook case of WHY I don't like long form storytelling.  And yeah, that's just me.<br/><br/>What would personally help me for coordinating a game like Houses, though, is some kind of tool that would help get the group on the same page about what THIS story is going to resolve and in a way that doesn't fix how or in what way it will resolve.  That way the group has a shared understanding of what represents an ending for the current story no matter what other points of interest may be left dangling.<br/><br/>Basically, a focus I can put on the table and say, "This story is about this.

Also the GM should be using the Season actions, the subsystems like romance or revenge (if they are in process) and aspects as a base to build the Situation on.<br/><br/>If you want to run a short term game like you mentioned, then you do not need a special tool to keep the game focused, just say "Hey guys this game is going to be all about X. Everyone make your characters with this in mind" Then when play starts provide a strong opening bang or event and have the player make rolls and wagers to flush that out, then proceed with resolving that and then drop another bang... and so on till the game is done.<br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276254/#Comment_276254" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-15T20:01:16+00:00" title="June 15, 2010  8:01PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2010 8:04PM by Jesse.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Colin,<br/><br/>I'm not sure what to say other than: That's what I did with the wedding scenario I mentioned above.

That means at a MINIMUM you can angle your NPCs to view the PCs as opportunities to that end.  Also every Ven has the expectations and obligations of being a noble put upon them.  Which means that even if you don't have any of those kind of more concrete cues we're talking about you can bring the weight of their culture down on them and see what they do.<br/><br/>The problem with me is that I don't find "social status and land acquisition" nor "the responsibilities of nobility" to be very interesting issues.  But if you DO find those grabby, those are built in by default and offer a nice starting point if you're any good at applying those.

If the players are not making Wisdom or Cunning rolls to generate stuff on their own I find that prompts to do so really help. Stuff like "So there is this wedding, everyone roll Wisdom and lets figure out what opportunities are there and why you are going!" Or "Count X gives you the death look, he hates your guts. Wanna roll to have some say into why he wants to see you dead tonight?"<br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276277/#Comment_276277" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-15T23:33:54+00:00" title="June 15, 2010 11:33PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: hans otterson</cite>That's true, Jesse, but am I generalizing too much in saying that concrete goals and values for characters don't mean much if the player doesn't care about them?</blockquote>\nIsn't that true of everything in every game forever?<br/><br/>yeah, I was being so broad what I said didn't really mean anything.

I actually think the 1-on-1 is just never going to work in HotB without a GM that brings a more thorough situation to the table. I don't think the wager economy will actually support a single player generating enough to sustain play or detail out a situation sufficiently to light anyone's candle. It's kind of a degenerate case for a lot of the player interactions, whether you call them PvP or more cooperative. A little like a one person PTA game. Nobody can get any fan mail.<br/><br/>And I'm not even sure 2 people is enough if the target situation is a political one. For politics to really work you need three factions pursuing their goals, that way people have an incentive to cut deals. <br/><br/>It might have made more sense in these cases for you to have a GM PC and prompt things directly?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276318/#Comment_276318" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T07:08:10+00:00" title="June 16, 2010  7:08AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse,<br/><br/>I like your breakdown of developing and resolving story.<br/><br/>In my experience with narrative-passing-type storytelling games, I found that they would sink of swim based on how strongly the mechanics got people to engage both of those phases fully. You need to motivate and/or remind the players first to develop/expand the story, and then to resolve conflicts and tie up storylines.<br/><br/>I'm not fond of doing it overtly--for instance, producing two distinct phases--but if the games drives that to happen in SOME way, it improves its "strike record" by a hundredfold.

Some of it still remained because I feel it is necessary to make a particular point.<br/><br/>A lot of indie gamers complain about combat rule fetishism. What I see from indie gamers is a lot of story rule fetishism. I'll explain what I mean.<br/><br/>When you say, "a list of possible goals/motivations" are necessary to assist you in making a character, I have to wonder where I went wrong. I mean, I put a TON of stuff in the book to get characters motivated.<br/><br/>Romance and Revenge not good enough for you? Ambition not good enough for you? Forbidden sorcery that will get you killed if anyone discovers you doing it and drive you mad if you study it too long not good enough for you? <br/><br/>I mean, jeebus guys! The more I read from people who play "indie" games, the more I realize that gamers want the designer to hold their hand or pull them by the nose.<br/><br/>Personally, I see "a step in character creation to choose a motivation" to be too heavy handed. TOO HEAVY HANDED. I realize that a lot of indie games out there do all your thinking for you, but I'm not that guy. I let the players make the character they want to play, establish the goals they want to set and tell the stories they want to tell.<br/><br/>If you need a rule telling you what your character wants... I'm sorry. In my mind, that's in the same boat as the people who want to keep track of every single detail of every single second of combat. Combat rule fetishists. Same thing as story rule fetishists.<br/><br/>At least, that's the way I've seen it. Every single time I run the larp, one guy comes up to me and says, "I don't get it." And I am not exaggerating or using hyperbole when I discover that he's a fan of SORCERER. Not fucking kidding. It's happened about five times. And each and every time, he's a regular poster on THE FORGE.<br/><br/>Thirty to forty other people rush up, buy the book, saying they had a blast... and that one guy is standing there telling me how my game doesn't work. While dozens of others are standing around him shouting how much fun they had. And because he didn't, the game doesn't work.<br/><br/>And this on the heels of Ron Edwards saying that some class of games destroy the mind's ability to appreciate story. Sheesh.<br/><br/>Anyway, this turned into something it didn't start out being. I'm going to write something much larger about this trend I'm seeing.<br/><br/>In the meantime, I'll return to my original point: I believe I provided a ton of motivations. Revenge and Romance are mechanics that can appear on your character sheet. There's a Patron Saint of Ambition. I made Sorcery and "Becoming the Emperor" illegal for a reason. Most players look at these elements of the game and build characters from them. They are in the game already. I do not understand why adding it to your character sheet--in essence, ADDING MORE RULES--makes the game more interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276366/#Comment_276366" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T10:33:57+00:00" title="June 16, 2010 10:33AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bringing up the Forge and Sorcerer and Ron was bullshit but that said, <br/><br/>I never found that character motivations were difficult for our Houses of the Blooded game.<br/><br/>Aspects and season actions gave us plenty of hooks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick" title="John Wick"><img alt="John Wick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick">John Wick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276367/#Comment_276367" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T10:34:41+00:00" title="June 16, 2010 10:34AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Michael Pfaff</cite>Just to chime in on "undermining" previous facts, I'd never let someone say, "It's a clever forgery" after someone said, "It IS so and so's dagger."<br/></blockquote>\nYou don't need to "rule" on that and it isn't a matter of Narrator judgment.<br/><br/>The Golden Rule of Wagers is very explicit: You cannot use wagers to say "no."

To me it seems that it works just fine for what it is, within the cultural context it's presented in. The Sorcerer fan (myself, say) just has to get over the fact that not all games are written for him. This shouldn't be difficult at this point of time, different strokes for different folks is pretty well-trod wisdom by now. Gamers need to accept that not all games are for them, designers need to accept that not all dislike is an attack on their game.<br/><br/>The reason for <i>why</i> HoB doesn't quite work is an interesting topic because I think that the game is a very clear, modernized and stream-lined representation of the goals and techniques of typical '90s mainstream game design (the sort John in part defined at the time). Thus many people around these parts face in it a style of gaming that they've left behind, but riven of many of its external signs. This is sort of similar to how people set up <i>Spirit of the Century</i> and <i>Shadow of Yesterday</i> side by side due to superficial mechanical similarity, never grogging the fundamental differences in underlying creative drives of the games. In this regard HoB is clearly of similar ilk to SotC and not at all like Sorcerer or TSoY; gamers coming from the latter will look at the game in just the sort of confusion we've been discussing in this thread, as the game doesn't serve their interests too well.<br/><br/>A few words more, simply because it seems to me pretty unfair to characterize your average "indie" game fan as a passive consumer without initiative of his own. The following uses GNS terminology because it's in those terms that I understand HoB and how it's received by the public. Obviously there are several people participating in this thread who think that GNS is so much balderdash, but I beg your indulgence - this is just how my brain works at the moment, no need for you to climb onto the same ride if you don't want to.<br/><br/>Putting aside the considerable literary virtues of Houses of the Blooded, the game itself does not orient the group for narrativistic play, and it does not provide for clear instructions that minimize "murk", the procedural uncertainty typical of traditional roleplaying. These two are separate issues, but we see both of them surfacing and entangling in these HoB discussions. For instance, I view Hans's writing about how the game doesn't instruct you sufficiently in this light: in truth the text of HoB is, it seems to me, perfectly careful to outline and describe the techniques and attitudes necessary for approaching the game successfully, although in a pretty conversational and eagle eye perspective instead of procedural terms. The part that's missing, and the reason for why Hans and myself among others feel disoriented by the game, is the narrativistic premise, a challenge to the opinions and values of the reader. When I wrote upthread that the game does not explain to me why I should care and towards what direction I should focus my attention, this was the same thing in different words: aside from any lack of sufficient examples or whatnot (which I don't think is true), the game lacks the drive and challenge that orients me so easily with a game like Sorcerer, to pick the example trotted out already. When you approach HoB from this narrativist viewpoint, without realizing the game's nature, it does really seem like you don't quite know what to do with the game, as it does seem like it lacks a point in this regard.<br/><br/>I think that it might be easier to understand this incongruence in how people approach the game by looking at the "murk" and the creative agenda issue separately. First of all, I should say that I recognize that "murk" is a very biased term for what is essentially celebrated as interpretative freedom and primacy of the play-group in some circles; still, that's the word I'm stuck with for now. My actual point is that I'm not very inclined to get onto a high horse about it if others want to write games that intentionally leave a lot of freedom for the play group in terms of who does what and when. Houses of the Blooded provides plenty of material for understanding the game, but it does not lay out clear procedural instructions for what to do when and how; it does not give bulleted pre-flight checklists, no numbered steps, no explicit instructions for what things a player should concern himself with when playing, no grand theory of any of it. Rather, it's written into an older mold: the assumption is that the players can cooperate with each other, the hope is that they will find the fictional color and issues of the Ven interesting, the expectation is that they will use the game akin to a toolbox in building up a campaign of their own, utilizing the provided tools at their own consideration instead of expecting the design to carry the responsibility. This is a different conception of how to write a roleplaying game, and perhaps a different idea of what the game fundamentally is, but I can't really declaim it as inferior; merely different.<br/><br/>The creative agenda issue is the one that is the killer for me personally, though: insofar as I can see, the simple reason for why some people don't get HoB despite being fans of all sorts of dramatic "narrative games" is that the game forefronts experience at the expense of choice. I might be wrong about the intention, but the message I got from the game was that my task as the reader and the player is not particularly to have any opinions about the Ven and their lifestyle; rather, my task is to learn of the Ven, imagine them and breathe life into them by the art of story play with my friends, appreciating the vision of their cruelty and passion as lyrical art. In other words, I should approach the game as simulationism instead of narrativism. All well and good, I think, as the very decision to interpret the game as a sim game text surely makes all the various rules click in ways that just don't happen if you try to approach the game like Sorcerer or some such. This whole wager thing, for example: I can totally see that if a player actually has a poetic vision of who his character is, and he wants to express that static image, then he's going to find utility in wagering and manipulating the situation in ways that spotlight this great character he has in this great setting. What the player wants is to exercise his creativity by participating in the storytelling and by showing off his creations, such as this character, which is his special personal project in the game. He wants to run the character through his paces, show him doing all the things that he's supposed to do. The brilliance of HoB as a simulationistic game comes in here in the way the Ven practically have a checklist of the "paces", what you should expect to be able to integrate into your character concept: play HoB and you can expect to get to describe/play witty banter, violent duels, steamy romances, bitter betrayals and so on and so forth. This is totally the list that most Vampire players (and many larpers) I've met yearn to concretize in their play, no matter the game. HoB is the right game for them because it totally allows them to just dive right in instead of having to mess about with the externalities the rest of us are interested in.<br/><br/>All of the above is pretty lackluster from a narrativist viewpoint because no value-based tensions are described or invited by the setting description. You can't play the human barbarians trot upon by the Ven, and neither are they humanized in a way that would invite sympathy from the Ven PCs, to pick an arbitrary example. Likewise the nature of the Ven themselves is static, there is never a challenge for the player characters to rise above the limitations of what they are. Similarly the Ven society itself is both intensely political and devoid of any real issues to be political <i>about</i>; the very idea of positing a "political game" that will have plots and counter-plots and cunning ploys a priori, with content added as an afterthought, is the very acme of dramatic simulationism - no wonder players expecting premiseful play feel confused. There isn't really any compelling <i>reason</i> for your character to want or do anything particularly out of the ordinary, as the game is written: your character starts within a basically static envelope of expected activities (dueling, romancing, etc.), and he never leaves that envelope to make a statement about anything. Thus, even as the game basically has all the fictional elements you'd expect of a highly dramatic narrativistic game, it's nothing like that - it's dramatic, but in a different, experiental and poetic way. The creative drive is not towards establishing meaning, but towards celebrating it. A schoolbook case of simulationism.<br/><br/>Now, simulationism is fun, but for me it's not quite as fun as some other things. To get back into the murk thing, a difficulty of HoB from my viewpoint is that I don't care quite enough about celebrating blood opera to do the work of getting the game to run. As points of comparison, I totally can get over the same hump in <i>Dead of Night</i> because it's more gamey and procedural - the creative agenda is the same and I'm about as interested in horror movies as I am in Ven fiction, but it's simply miles and miles easier and more fun to set up DoN (creating monsters in the game is net fun alone, for instance), so that's why it gets over my play threshold. The opposite example is any game they've written about Glorantha: they're mostly just as murky and old-fashioned procedurally as HoB, but because the setting just oozes meaningful tensions and expects me to take a stance, I'm highly motivated to get over the hump, craft a campaign framework by my own hands out of mere setting fluff and go play, throwing out judgments about Lunar philosophy all the way.<br/><br/>Still, this is not a claim to any absolute and objective brokenness of HoB, just an explanation of why the game's not doing it for me. I've given it many positive soundbites here in Finland as it comes up now and then, and I routinely recommend it to people who like Whitewolf games or AEG stuff - as I usually say, the game is a honest expression of games of its nature and even if that style's really not my thing, I recognize quality when I see it - the system is much more streamlined and to the point of its creative goals than anything they did for this type of dramatic simulationism through the '90s, for instance, and the instructions are more functional as regards the responsibilities of the players vs. the GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276390/#Comment_276390" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T12:15:04+00:00" title="June 16, 2010 12:15PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2010 1:11PM by JDCorley.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Likewise the nature of the Ven themselves is static, there is never a challenge for the player characters to rise above the limitations of what they are.</blockquote>\nI disagree to an extent. That is to say, this challenge is treated no differently than, say, the challenge to kill my nine half-sisters before any of them have a male heir.  If you make a character that is all about (for example) reforming and advancing Ven civilization in some particular way (say, in relations with human barbarians as you mention elsewhere), the game will support and work with that just fine. But the game doesn't <i>privilege</i> that challenge as being somehow fundamentally special. If someone chooses to do that, it works just fine, as a character who wants to rise above their own Ven-ness is still going to have to deal with romance, poisonings, etc., and in fact there's probably no dramatic tension in the character choice if they don't.  I think what your complaint is is that you think this particular character build should be foregrounded, with a circle around it, saying, "do this, it's different than just wanting to fuck your sister and marry your aunt."  I don't think that's realistic for, as you say, a game that is meant to be interpreted by the play-group.  <br/><br/>I mean, I got through Houses of the Blooded and the first thing I said was that the costumery should approximate a European diplomatic dinner circa 1825. Is this the greatest misreading that has ever occurred in the mind of man?

I think that's one area the wagers can really help flesh things out.  In other words, you make an ambitious, political character, but instead of reading a 10 page treatise on trade and interventions and deciding what you're going to do about it, you make a wager: "My idiot brother has completely fucked up the indigo market." and now you've got something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276401/#Comment_276401" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T12:49:37+00:00" title="June 16, 2010 12:49PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that the game does not place any fundamental obstacles in the way of narrativism (although it's a bit tricky to choose the right times to use wagers and avoid the wrong times). As you say, it just doesn't forefront the viewpoint. This is often enough in practice these days, as roleplayers are so well catered by games that do exactly the things they want, which makes us less eager to do the work. For instance, I don't need to try to figure out the interesting dramatic tensions implied by the setting in HoB when I can play games that offer these things to me on a silver platter. A matter of excitement - the same game text can inflame some members of the audience while it falls flat for others for no greater reason than successful specialization: the game doesn't speak to those who do not want what it has to offer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick" title="John Wick"><img alt="John Wick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick">John Wick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276406/#Comment_276406" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T12:58:40+00:00" title="June 16, 2010 12:58PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My father-in-law played HotB a few times. Afterward, he dropped out of the game. He told me that he liked the mechanics a lot, he liked the fact that his character had an in-built weakness, he likes wagers and style points, but he does not like playing nobles. He doesn't like the ven. When I told him about using the rules for space opera (a future stand-alone supplement), he was very excited. "I'd love to play that!" he told me.<br/><br/>I mention this in the shadow of Eero's comments because Will's comment of "I don't like to play nobles" is succinct, direct and understandable. Keep that in mind.<br/><br/>___<br/><br/>As a quick aside, I should also mention that I don't buy G/N/S as a hypothesis, let alone a theory. I think it is about as useful as any other system that designates any creative endeavor into three limited categories. See my "Chair, Loveseat, Sofa Theory. Everything in the world can be broken down into three things: a chair (one person can sit comfortably), a loveseat (up to two people can sit comfortably) or a sofa (three or more people can sit comfortably). Anything in the world fits this "theory." The question, however, I must ask about G/N/S is, "How useful is this for designing games?" In my experience, thinking inside a box--even a three-sided box--is still thinking inside a box.<br/><br/>___<br/><br/>And now, in the interest of making games better, I'd like to ask a few clarifying questions. I hope you have time to answer them. I'm truly interested in your answers.<br/><br/><br/><b>"... the game itself does not orient the group for narrativistic play, and it does not provide for clear instructions that minimize "murk", the procedural uncertainty typical of traditional roleplaying."</b><br/><br/>Could you provide some evidence for this claim? In what way does the game <i>not</i> orient the group for narrativistic play?<br/><br/>___<br/><br/><b>When I wrote upthread that the game does not explain to me why I should care and towards what direction I should focus my attention, this was the same thing in different words: aside from any lack of sufficient examples or whatnot (which I don't think is true), the game lacks the drive and challenge that orients me so easily with a game like Sorcerer, to pick the example trotted out already. When you approach HoB from this narrativist viewpoint, without realizing the game's nature, it does really seem like you don't quite know what to do with the game, as it does seem like it lacks a point in this regard.</b><br/><br/>This is a great example of what I was talking about when I said that story fetishism demands the game designer hold your hand. The book has over 100 pages of ven culture: a vast labyrinth of manners, revenge, loopholes, etc. According to your claim, <i>none of this matters</i>. (That statement may be harsh, but I think it is accurate.) You need a specific bullet point list of motivations. You read the entire book and could not find a single motivation to assign to a character, but adding a bullet list would have helped?<br/><br/>___<br/><br/><b>The creative agenda issue is the one that is the killer for me personally, though: insofar as I can see, the simple reason for why some people don't get HoB despite being fans of all sorts of dramatic "narrative games" is that the game forefronts experience at the expense of choice. </b><br/><br/>Instead of speaking in abstracts, could you provide a specific example of difference between my game and another? <br/>___<br/><br/><b>All of the above is pretty lackluster from a narrativist viewpoint because no value-based tensions are described or invited by the setting description.</b><br/><br/>Could you please support this assertion with evidence? Begin by defining "value-based tensions."<br/><br/>___<br/><br/><b> To get back into the murk thing, a difficulty of HoB from my viewpoint is that I don't care quite enough about celebrating blood opera to do the work of getting the game to run.</b><br/><br/>Not so much a question, but an observation.<br/><br/>The weakness of the game is that you don't care enough about Blood Opera? I don't give a shit about supernatural westerns. That doesn't make Deadlands a weak game.<br/><br/>___<br/><br/><b>The opposite example is any game they've written about Glorantha: they're mostly just as murky and old-fashioned procedurally as HoB, but because the setting just oozes meaningful tensions and expects me to take a stance...</b><br/><br/>Could you please illustrate how the game fails to expect you to take a stance?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276428/#Comment_276428" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T14:15:21+00:00" title="June 16, 2010  2:15PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll be happy to tell about my impressions, John, although it's been a while since I read the game text; I'm not able to quote line and verse, for instance. With that in mind:<br/><br/>The main reason for why I didn't find HoB inspiring as a tool of narrativism is that its focus as a text is squarely in the form of passion instead of its content. The game describes carefully how romance works, for instance, but it doesn't really have much of human context for why I should have my character fall in love aside from the fact that this is expected and it's fun to play romance scenes. To the contrary, the book seems to revel in the idea that the Ven do not think like humans do, and their love is more like a sport than a passion. I'm not really feeling the Ven as human beings with human concerns in the text in general: everything they do is couched as a convention and part of their Ven-nature, even such sublime mystery as love is regulated and thoroughly explained for both its function and its proper place in society. I'm sure that you can reach beyond this in play if you feel like it, but purely as a text HoB never makes me stand up and pay attention to any human issue: the Ven have no external enemies, they begin families as a matter of convenience, their politics are practical powers truggles devoid of philosophy and so on. I'm not getting the sympathetic relationship to the people of the setting that seems like a necessity for narrativism to me; if I don't care for or appreciate the people our stories concern, then those stories carry power only of poetic aesthetic, not the sort of thematic punch narrativism expects.<br/><br/>Perhaps this could be put succintly: it seems to me that we care of what a HoB character does because it's cool, not because we care about the act itself and the person doing it.<br/><br/>This same philosophy of aesthetic celebration seems to pervade how a player character is and what it is for in the game. I often speak of "princess play", meaning the sort of roleplaying where you're not playing your character so much to find out who he is and what he does, but rather to display your predeveloped piece of character creation art. This is what the game's rules and procedures seem to encourage with the elaborate premade family backgrounds and other details: you're creating a lot of poetic detail that will get a chance to be expressed in play. What you're specifically not doing in the game is to build up a sympathetic protagonist - your character is not meant to be sympathetic, but rather impressive, the sort of personage we would use as a NPC in The Shadow of Yesterday. Impressive and stylish to look at, to be sure, but perhaps not a dynamic actor of great human passion. The wager system especially seems like it underscores this point, as it does not tell a story of how your character wins or loses: the outcome and the consequences are really not what we're interested in, but rather the process of resolution, the beautiful images of what happens. Choreography your character engages in for the sake of aesthetics, as a doll. Satisfaction for you as a player is found in putting your character in the middle of the events and expressing his nature as a magnificent bastard (or whatever that character's nature is, within the constraints of the setting).<br/><br/>In the interest of demonstrating differences like you asked, and without wanting to make any claims about relative quality, I'll reflect the way I understand HoB against a game I know well, The Shadow of Yesterday. TSoY is a very similar game to HoB in that they're both fantasy games in original settings, and both have a fair share of pulp fantasy in their ancestry. They are also similar in amount of crunch, social footprint of the campaign and so on. I should make it clear that the following is very likely exaggerated for effect when it comes to actual play: I'm emphasizing the differences in attitude, so this is natural. Besides, what do I really know about how the HoB text should be really interpreted?\n<ul><li>Player characters in TSoY are different from each other in culture, social position and beliefs, and encouraged to be so. They are likely going to live different lives and struggle over different issues, each according to their nature. They are expected to change their world, which is in a fundamentally unstable state. PCs in HoB are uniform insofar as their larger setting context is concerned, sharing a base of values and expectations. The general sorts of content their lives have are largely defined by the Ven lifestyle. Their struggles and passion are expected to be played out in the ways planned for in their lifestyle, and no fundamental change to their lifestyle is to be expected out of the game - the setting will be the same after the campaign as it was before, the point of play was strictly in the journey and not the goal.</li><li>The concerns of PCs in HoB are primarily characterized by external requirements of form: a Ven needs to have romance in his life, therefore I will now introduce a romantic partner for this character. The concerns of PCs in TSoY are primarily derived from their conditions: this character encounters a fetching person of the opposite sex, will he fall in love? The players of HoB act to fill the scenario of play with content because their characters need content to exist with; the players of TSoY experience content to form stances towards it, have their characters make choices and experience the consequences.</li><li>The setting of HoB is concerned with documenting the everyday reality the campaign exists in. It is static and concerned with how things usually are. The setting is exotic and many things that are ordinary for the characters in it are strange and luxuriously intriguing for the players. The setting of TSoY focuses on the fault-lines - the ordinary things in the setting are also ordinary for the players (genre-ordinary, at least) and passed on quickly, while the extraordinary and strange things are also points of tension and instability and human suffering, problems that will blow up on the heroes of any story.</li><li>The HoB wager rules and GMing advice focus on distributing narrative authority to enable the players to express their characters and create a complicated plot. The TSoY Key rules and GMing advice focus on providing the characters with dramatic choices that cast light on their fundamental nature and challenge them to change. The goal of play in HoB is to revel in the Ven aesthetic, while the goal of play in TSoY is to figure out what the past means for the future, if anything.</li></ul>\nI'm not particularly offended by this idea that a story fetishist wants the game designer to hold his hand, by the way. I think that there's nothing wrong with solid game design that makes the game, whatever it is, easier to engage with, but I certainly know a lot of people who disagree on this as well. Might be that this is because I'm a game designer of sorts myself, so characterizing my play as suckling at the designer's teat is just putting my creative contribution from one box into another ;D In any case this idea of story vs. combat fetishism is interesting in that it sort of implies a different observation: is it that "flexible" gamers who do not focus on (fetishize) particular facets of play are happier with a more vague and organic game text? Perhaps, at least that seems to be suggested by John's observations. Should we all ask less of the designer? As I suggested earlier, from my own viewpoint this matter seems more like a consumer motivation issue - with the scene living an unprecedented culturally rich time, I have plenty of luxury to pass on games that present me with too much work for too small a payoff; the games that get play from me thus end up being ones where I really like the fluff and am willing to put up with a less than perfect game text, or ones that make play so easy that I'll do it even if I'm not extremely passionate about the fluff. Interestingly my own game Zombie Cinema fits in the second box for me: I can't imagine starting a game of All Flesh Must be Eaten or anything like that, zombies just aren't at that level of obsession for me.<br/><br/>In other words, yes, I do usually like succint and conscise game texts over a hundred pages of exposition and advice. That seems awfully unfair to something like HoB (which has a very rich and honest game text, as I've mentioned), but the fact remains that pedagogically speaking the short text that turns difficult concepts into clear procedures is often the more valuable to me. This is what I tried to express when mentioning Hans's critique of the game text earlier: I don't really think that HoB is badly written, I just think that the things Hans is looking for aren't there, and therefore it seems to him like something was left unexplained. But in reality nothing was, it's all rather clear once you understand that the Ven do not ask why they love or make war - they just do, and our task is to enjoy the panorama.<br/><br/>Also, to belabor the point: I don't think that HoB is at fault as a game design for not being something that would inflame my passions. I might have described my relationship with the game as a "fault" for it, but that's mostly because of the general thread context here - we've been discussing the wagers and whatnot and why some of us aren't excited about the game and so forth. I appreciate any designer's wish to make better games, but I'm not so sure that HoB could be a better game from my viewpoint without also losing the features that make it right for its fans. This is, of course, a Forge theory attitude I'm displaying: a belief that some creative concerns are fundamentally incompatible. A more traditional take would be to believe that a game can be right for all people, I guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick" title="John Wick"><img alt="John Wick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Wick">John Wick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276439/#Comment_276439" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T14:48:43+00:00" title="June 16, 2010  2:48PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>"The game describes carefully how romance works, for instance, but it doesn't really have much of human context for why I should have my character fall in love aside from the fact that this is expected and it's fun to play romance scenes."</b><br/><br/>Um... I need to explain love? How does this not fall under my "indie gamers want me to hold their hands" category?<br/><br/><br/><b>...the Ven have no external enemies...</b><br/><br/>Um... humans have no external enemies. Does that limit the drama of Shakespeare? Because lack of external enemies certainly makes Hamlet a weaker play, correct?<br/><br/>What do you call orks or spectres or the sorcerer-kings or, indeed, Shanri the world itself (which is clearly defined as "out to get the ven.")?<br/><br/>You don't have external enemies in <i>Sorcerer</i>. Or <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>. Or <i>My Life with Master</i>. I fail to see how this is important, let alone a weakness in the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Perhaps this could be put succintly: it seems to me that we care of what a HoB character does because it's cool, not because we care about the act itself and the person doing it.</b><br/><br/>That's you, not the game. I do not see how the game conveys that as "truth." I see a lot of interpolation in your statements: inserting meaning that is not in the actual text. Also, if this is true, why is it important?<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Player characters in TSoY are different from each other in culture, social position and beliefs, and encouraged to be so.</b><br/><br/>America is a singular culture. You mean to say that there is no difference in social position, beliefs, politics, etc. in America? Or England? Or France? Or Germany? Or anywhere else in the world? If playing a singular race in a singular culture with a singular people is not exciting to you, please explain the success of <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>.<br/><br/>The ven disagree about <i>everything</i>. They disagree on values. They disagree on the laws. They disagree on virtues. I do not see this as a true distinction, but a failure on your part to see distinction.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>The concerns of PCs in HoB are primarily characterized by external requirements of form...</b><br/><br/>This paragraph is a prime example of "verbal spaghetti." There are a lot of words here, but I do not understand what they mean next to each other.<br/><br/><br/><b>The setting of HoB is concerned with documenting the everyday reality the campaign exists in. It is static and concerned with how things usually are. </b><br/><br/>The game encourages players to <i>change the world</i> and gives them mechanics to do so. For example, the players are told about a law that states "There will never be a high king" with the explicit premise that becoming high king is a valid and reachable goal. The world <i>is changing</i>. The ven are adapting a ruined culture to their own. The sorcerer-kings are dead (we hope) and we are adapting what they left behind to suit ourselves. You also failed to give specific examples of the difference between HotB and SoY. I do not understand the distinction beyond your vague language. More specific examples are necessary; otherwise, I will just chalk it up to reader misunderstanding and textual interpolation.<br/><br/><br/><b>The goal of play in HoB is to revel in the Ven aesthetic, while the goal of play in TSoY is to figure out what the past means for the future, if anything.</b><br/><br/>What specific mechanic in SoY does this? A specific mechanic, please.<br/><br/><br/><b>Ven do not ask why they love or make war - they just do, and our task is to enjoy the panorama.</b><br/><br/>This weekend, we played a Court of Love where the party members debated the true nature of love. They told stories about love and the party argued which story was the best illustration of "true love." They debated whether true love existed or not. They debated whether or not the ven can even achieve true love. They debated, they debated, they debated.<br/><br/>And you know what? The Court of Love is a concept introduced in the Romance chapter. The ven debating about love. Not all agreeing upon it, but disagreeing. Unable to come to a conclusion. Unable to settle differences.<br/><br/>The ven debate Revenge all the time. They call Juries to debate whether or not Revenge is suitable under certain circumstances. I had a Jury debate for a whole hour--three players sitting down and arguing for an hour--about whether or not Revenge was appropriate. They talked about the meaning of Revenge. They talked about applicable retribution. They talked, they disagreed, they argued. And all of this is in the Revenge chapter.<br/><br/><b>Also, to belabor the point: I don't think that HoB is at fault as a game design for not being something that would inflame my passions.

I'm not trying to prove that your game is bad or a failure, I'm just giving one person's impression of what I got from the text when I read it and why I think that the game doesn't float my boat. I read a lot of games, it's not like I go out of my way to invent meanings that I'm not getting from the text. It's entirely possible that I've missed the point of HoB, but that's what you get in individual textual interpretation. For any sort of larger truth of what a text actually says it's probably more fruitful to look at whether there is any consistency between larger numbers of people in the lessons they take out of the text. Anybody have an opinion, did I just fundamentally misunderstand the nature of the HoB text when I read it? (Not you Jason, I know what you think ;D)<br/><br/>Even as I'm not any sort of expert on HoB, at least I know what I like and what I don't like. It might be that the game I got from reading HoB is not the game that is supposed to be in there, but I don't think that I'm doing any grave injustice to it by saying that the game I found in the book isn't my cup of tea, but seems to be well written for what it is. I even tried my best to list the things in the game that I think off the top of my hat to be likely reasons for why the game didn't intrigue me as a tool of play (as opposed to a reading piece). Besides, this opinion isn't likely to change by <i>debating</i> it - I'm happy to accept that perhaps the game text of HoB includes all the things that I like in games and I just somehow missed them, and I should read the game anew and see if it'll start to appeal to me. What more is there to be said about that?<br/><br/>(I guess what I'm trying to say is that perhaps you should just accept my observations for what they are, John - just one person's reaction to the game. Convincing me that I'm wrong won't do anything much for the game text, so nodding sagely and seeing if others have found a similar perspective on the game seems like a good idea. Besides, for all I know I might be quite alone with my impression of the game and why Sorcerer fans don't like it, in which case my insight has limited value for you.)<br/><br/>The specific mechanics in TSoY that focus the game on its subject matter are in the way the setting material is transformed into playable scenarios by defining NPCs committed to their cultural values that lead them to iniquity or tragedy. Then we take a bunch of sympathetic player characters who have to deal with this scenario and make choices concerning self-determination of the individual vs. his ancestral culture, the subdued civilization vs. the dominant, the cruel wisdom of the past vs. the opportunities of the future and other such facets, all described by the setting and setting-related crunch of the game. The theme of past vs. the future alluded to in the game's title arises as an underlying current of similarities between the various situations depicted in the setting material; the mechanics themselves are basically generic, but in combination with the setting material they bring forth the premise from the game's title.<br/><br/>Mostly your comments on my effort at listing perceived differences are refutations of the significance of my points. I don't mean to say that you need inter-cultural conflict for interesting drama when I bring this difference between HoB and TSoY up - of course I don't, but that is an example of a place in the respective games' milieus where one game pushes choices and dynamic instability while the other doesn't. It's probably not a crucial difference, considering the many different subject matters a game can have, but it is an example of how the setting of HoB on a larger level is not subsumed with meaning, but is rather static and to be taken at face value. This is probably fine for the game considering its personal scope, of course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276449/#Comment_276449" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T15:29:57+00:00" title="June 16, 2010  3:29PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, perhaps this is the real topic here: I'm sorry if Forge-associated critics of your game have given it bad reviews, John.

As I mentioned above, it's not like you're going to convince the skeptics about the game's virtues by debating it on a web forum, so surely we can think of something more constructive? My own policy with games I don't like but where I recognize craftsmanship has generally been to try to talk about them as I see them, recommending them for their virtues, but noting them also for the things they are not. Is there something more we could be doing to ensure that HoB finds its right audience?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doug%20Bonar" title="Doug Bonar"><img alt="Doug Bonar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doug%20Bonar">Doug Bonar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276450/#Comment_276450" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-16T15:33:53+00:00" title="June 16, 2010  3:33PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Wick</cite><cite>Posted By: Michael Pfaff</cite>Just to chime in on "undermining" previous facts, I'd never let someone say, "It's a clever forgery" after someone said, "It IS so and so's dagger."<br/></blockquote>\nYou don't need to "rule" on that and it isn't a matter of Narrator judgment.<br/><br/>The Golden Rule of Wagers is very explicit: You cannot use wagers to say "no."

And that clash at the table meant an un-fun game for me.</blockquote>\nHans,<br/><br/>Along these lines my problem is that the rules mix and match two different attitudes toward the culture.  The ven have all these crazy laws right?  And the text challenges you break them, right?  My Story Now brain immediately latches onto those sections of the text raising this question: "When is cultural/social transgression worth personal gain?"  When do you go fight a duel WITHOUT assembling a jury?  When do you murder someone in someone else's home WITHOUT getting the host's permission?  When do you play by the societal rules and when you do break them?<br/><br/>So SOME culture rules in the text clearly fall into that category.  But OTHER culture rules are tied directly to the mechanics.  Consider how the Romance rules work.  The Romance rules conform directly to the predator/prey ritual valued in the culture.  There is no way to challenge the ven's culture idea of Romance *and still engage the mechanics of the game meaningfully*.  The sub-system becomes irrelevant if you want to play a character who challenges the cultural definition of Romance.<br/><br/>You see this in the LARP rules for dueling.  It talks about how in Ven culture it's extremely rude and and a grand breach of etiquette to interrupt a duel.  Which of course gets MY mind thinking about what might be important enough to my character that I would be willing to breach that etiquette.  At least in THAT example it's pretty clear that the REAL rule is simply the social conceit that if you want in on a duel you have to be in on it with the other players before it begins.  It's a social rule of the game *masquerading* as a cultural rule and it's pretty easy to get the dramatic effect you want if you're attentive to it: Go buy into the duel at the beginning with Style then *pretend* your character is jumping in the middle to interrupt.<br/><br/>Less so the murder rules.  There's no way to murder someone as a deliberate character statement that you're willing to defy the host's hospitality.<br/><br/>It's really Houses dual nature where cultural rules that demand breaking and questioning lie side-by-side with cultural rules that are tied so deeply with the mechanics that to question/break them is to not mechanically engage the game.  And in some cases it's difficult to distinguish the two such as assembling a jury for a duel.  Is that a cultural ritual to be flaunted if my character's passions demand it?  Or is it a social game rule justified via culture designed to protect other players from being drawn into duels "unjustly"?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276668/#Comment_276668" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-17T13:55:35+00:00" title="June 17, 2010  1:55PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi John,<br/><br/>I think you're a cool dude.
