Seemed too soft and good-humored.  But I guess Brian Blessed has ruined that role for everyone.<br/><br/>The Targaryen we're totally harry potter!! - like Draco Malfoy and Luna Lovegood exactly!  My suspension of disbelief went BARP-FAIL! when they were onscreen.<br/><br/>I also thought the Dothraki were too 'pretend barbarian', like dressed in designer rags with faux-dirt smudges on them, as if they were off to a costume party.  Or maybe it was that they had the type of unnatural musculature that you can only get from gym work.  both.  D.d. Laurentus can get away with Arnie in a campy fantasy, but it looked out of place here.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it a lot, but the Targaryen/Dothraki scenes were not up to scratch.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321189/#Comment_321189" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-19T04:41:43+00:00" title="April 19, 2011  4:41AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I overall thought it was pretty awesome, but I'm inclined to agree that the scenes in Pentos lacked something.<br/>In my case, though, I think it was that enough explanation was not given -  Viserys asks if Dany wants to "wake the dragon" when it hasn't been made clear just how much the house sigils mean to people.<br/>For that matter, the dragon eggs seem to kind of come out of nowhere, if you've only watched the show. <br/>I was told to expect "Unfortunate Fantasy Hair" but I was pleasantly surprised that nothing too bizarre was attempted. <br/>The sets were excellent, especially the Wall and the sacred grove at Winterfell. <br/><br/>Why didn't it occur to me earlier that the Starks were basically Scottish lords? <br/>Was anyone else pleased but mildly surprised by the casting/makeup choice for Jaime Lannister? He seemed a tad too slick and unathletic to quite fit, but the actor did a good *version* of him, to be sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/netwomble" title="netwomble"><img alt="netwomble" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh6.google.com/netwomble/R5fup6Cz6tI/AAAAAAAABIQ/mSl7x0gzHo0/s144/Womble_logo_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/netwomble">netwomble</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321192/#Comment_321192" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-19T05:16:02+00:00" title="April 19, 2011  5:16AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was underwhelmed.<br/><br/>Probably because I'm only about half way through the first book, which means a lot of small differences were immediately obvious to me.

I don't mean the scenery -- it's Ireland, it's gorgeous.<br/><br/>I mean, one wide to medium shot after another, often with perfectly symmetrical composition. Like <i>strangely</i> symmetrical shots one after another. Characters dead center in the frame with balance archways or candles or other characters to either side.<br/><br/>Correct me if I'm wrong (I haven't read the books but I'm familiar with the series from pop culture buzz) but isn't this set in a world that is <i>out of balance</i>? And yet, there were about fifteen to twenty perfectly <i>balanced</i> shots.<br/><br/>And all of it at a remove from the characters. We never got in close with these people. The shot that killed me and set the tone for the rest of the night was when Eddard was cleaing his sword, under that tree along the brook. Sure, it was nicely composed -- it looked like something right out of a painting from Artist Alley at GenCon. But I don't need that. I wanted to be in close, looking at Eddard's hands over Eddard's shoulders, <i>with him</i> as he worked his sword from his point of view. I mean, they make a big deal about him being a warrior. And he is! Let's see him working that sword. Let's see him working with his hands. Let's get in there.<br/><br/>And then, when Catelyn showed up, he could have looked up and we would have seen her eyes, from his point view, looking down at the sword, knowing that sword was why the king was coming and what that sword would mean to their future.<br/><br/>Instead we got a shot about a tree and a brook.<br/><br/>And then, when Eddard and Catelyn were in bed together, we still got no closer than a two shot? Really? Those two wonderful faces, and we couldn't get a close-up of their faces together before the big moment where Eddard will be torn from Catelyn because of his responsibility to the crown? Please.<br/><br/>I'll give it another episode or two, but if this We're Making Cool Pictures Removed from the Characters visual template really is the show, I don't think I'll be able to stay in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321216/#Comment_321216" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-19T10:43:13+00:00" title="April 19, 2011 10:43AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher raises an interesting argument with the camerawork, and while it didn't bother me half that much, I must agree with him. I'm not as negative towards it however. We'll see where it goes.<br/><br/>Otherwise all the flaws I perceived were the expected fallout of this being the first/semi-pilot episode of a book adaptation series set in an incredibly rich and nuanced world with a bazillion characters. There's no way at all they could have gotten all of it on film in one hour. I mean, Rickon was onscreen for like half a second, it was almost impossible to distinguish between Rob, Theon, Jon and whoever else was there with Eddard, I forgot.

THE WIRE found a style that worked for the show and juggled all those elements. In fact, HBO has sort built the template like this for shows like this with DEADWOOD, ROME, BOARDWALK EMPIRE.

I mean, I think you're right. I was in the office of HBO for a meeting about something else just before the pilot went into production and I begged them NOT to make <i>Game of Thrones</i> all show-off-the-production-values and stand-offish, and so on. To make it mundane and tight and intimate. And they said they had hired Tom McCarthy to direct it. And I was like, "That's fucking genius!"<br/><br/>And then they fired McCarthy after he finished his pilot, hired a new director, and re-shot the pilot.<br/><br/>And my guess is, that Judd you are correct about why that happened.<br/><br/>But I think that's a fear based decision. And a bad one.<br/><br/>Here's my take. <br/><br/>The <i>telling</i> of a story is about viscerally and emotionally grabbing the audience by telling the tale by what's happening <i>between</i> the characters. (Which is how we tell stories with dramatic narrative -- TV, Film, Plays).<br/><br/>There's a certain kind of viewer (let's call him geeky) that's all obsessed about the details and the setting, but really, that stuff is background to the tale being created <i>between</i> the characters as they interact.<br/><br/>Test cases: Looking <i>only</i> at the movies of <i>Star Wars: A New Hope</i> or <i>Aliens</i>, can anyone <i>really</i> tell me how these fantastical or SF setting really work? What the laws, cultures, economies, politics and so on really are? Of course you can't. Because they don't matter to the telling of the story to an audience. Because what matters to an audience is what happens between the characters as they make decisions, choose how to live, and speak and take action to those ends.<br/><br/>I'll point out again that <i>Game of Throne</i> as a television series is no more complicated than <i>The Wire</i>, and pretty much on part with a clutch of other long-form cable shows that have already aired on HBO, AMC or SyFy.<br/><br/>My point is that if the pilot for <i>Game of Thrones</i> had been shot more intimately and viscerally, I would have been more engaged as a viewer even if I might even have gotten less information (perhaps).  I'm pretty sure I would have absorbed what information that I needed to keep going. That's what audience generally do.<br/><br/>Clearly I'm touching on gaming stuff here. (I'll be writing about this in in <i>Play Sorcere</i>r in... oh.. about two hours by my count...!)<br/><br/>A lot of gamers want all the world stuff clear, all the details, all the cultural splat books and so on. But <a href="http://www.movieline.com/2010/03/david-mamets-memo-to-the-writers-of-the-unit.php" rel="nofollow">you don't need that stuff to dramatic narrative work.</a> And I see the storytelling of RPGs as closer kin to dramatic narrative than anything else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321251/#Comment_321251" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-19T15:02:50+00:00" title="April 19, 2011  3:02PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            good stuff!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321258/#Comment_321258" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-19T16:18:15+00:00" title="April 19, 2011  4:18PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The challenge with fantasy on the screen, for me, is to make the characters feel like real people.<br/><br/>You have weird clothes, weird situations, and weird settings, and so it's really easy for the characters to seem like they're not real people.<br/><br/>Game of Thrones I thought did well in avoiding "Heroese" - that weird English dialect they speak in some fantasy films, where it's like everyone's trying to sound as pompous and portentous as possible.<br/><br/>Christopher is right though that the cinematography didn't do them any favours. It's like they were trying to constantly remind us that we were watching a fanstasy show, rather than let that sit in the background.<br/><br/>I really wish that producers would credit audiences with some degree of maturity and not splash gratuitous nudity and violence all over the show. Hopefully they calm this down in coming episodes.<br/><br/>It's depressing to me that the show didn't take any steps towards diversity in casting. It's 2011, you'd think we could avoid yet another show with an all-white cast.  It's fantasy, so there's no reason they couldn't make one of the families black. I know that fans of the books would whine about it, but whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321259/#Comment_321259" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-19T16:32:47+00:00" title="April 19, 2011  4:32PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They are in 'fantasy england' so a black familly would be weird.

Its Englandanlity is essential to what Martin is going for. <br/><br/>(Skin tone has little to do with sun exposure.)<br/><br/>EDIT: I don't know what the demographics were like in Medieval England were like with respect to non-white* people, but that's not really what matters anyway. He's writing about the figures that history has left us, and as far as I know, they're almost entirely white.<br/><br/>And, crucially, the books indicate a wide world that is just off the where the narrative is looking, where there are lots of perfectly healthy and normal (for this universe) people who aren't white. So far, the show is failing to show us these people.<br/><br/>* Calling people in Medieval England white seems weird, since whiteness doesn't mean now what it meant then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321278/#Comment_321278" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-19T19:51:09+00:00" title="April 19, 2011  7:51PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 19, 2011 7:52PM by Simon_C.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>Simon, the series is very, very, very much about a huge fantasy version of England.

He did a fuckton of research about England (or already knew a bunch; he's a history buff), picked the parts of history that interested him, then used them as creative seeds to build fiction around. Finally, the characters in the series are often inspired by specific English historical figures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321288/#Comment_321288" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-19T21:06:47+00:00" title="April 19, 2011  9:06PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C.

I'm not sure why that requires the characters to be white though. I mean, I don't see how that makes the series more specifically relevant to England than any other fantasy series. The show (and the series) is not about England, right? It's about violence and warfare and passion and trust and honour and betrayal. If the books have an overarching theme, I'd say that it's something about how war turns people into monsters, and that good intentions don't guarantee good results.<br/><br/>I get that the fantasy genre, as a whole, centralises white people, I'm just not sure that it needs to.<br/><br/>What I'm interested in is what blackness "means" on the screen.

He's mentioned the histories of other parts of Europe as an influence, but he's still reading history written in English, which means there's more English history available to him. It's the War of the Roses that gets mentioned most often as a main influence, though GRRM says there's no 1:1 correspondences.<br/><br/>More important than that, GRRM is pretty obsessed with painting medieval knight miniatures, and creating medieval dioramas. I believe he's in his 60s now, so he's old enough that the medieval revival was pretty strong when he was growing up (think Ivanhoe and old Robin Hood movies), so it's not that surprising that his fantasy would be as deliberately white-people fantasy as Tolkien's was. The argument that "it's fantasy, you can do whatever you want" doesn't hold water here, because yeah, he can write whatever, but the visual language he's working with is not as flexible in that respect. Medieval knights, heraldry, pennants, castles, white people. Fixed visual tropes that no argument over literature can change.<br/><br/>That's the book. As for the show? The wallets of people who want to see a show that is faithful to the books outnumber the wallets of people like you.

Why is it that we see whiteness as so important to the visual identity of the characters, but other aspects (10 year winters, fantasy religions, ice monsters, people with all their teeth) are flexible? Why does changing the style of characters' clothing not signify anything, but changing the colour of their skin does? I think that it's because white skin signifies "normality" in our culture, while dark skin signifies "otherness".<br/><br/>I agree that money was probably a factor in why the producers of the show chose not to change this aspect of the books. I'm not saying I don't understand their motives for doing so, I'm saying I'm disappointed that they made that choice.<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/><br/>I want to be clear that I'm not saying "OMG THIS IS A RACIST SHOW FOR RACISTS". I'm saying that the show, in the context of every other fantasy show, which are also pretty much whites-only, is a missed opportunity. You don't have to feel guilty about liking it!

You're asking a show with legitimate reasons to be "all-white" to not be "all-white" because of a complaint about the genre in general. There are other properties that support your position a lot better than this one.<br/><br/>No, I don't disagree, of course not. Why would white people in a white society do anything else? "Fantasy" is a white-people genre, created by white people who associated mostly with other white people. If fantasy includes non-whites it gets charged with Orientalism. Perhaps with good reason, as it's built out of European history which also has a long history of Orientalist tropes, and those become part of white-people fantasy as well. But fantasy also doesn't tend to draw from American cultural imagery. American fantasy authors, and a lot of D&amp;D, still draw from European history for images, no matter how American the underlying story and behaviour is. And the conception of European history that is drawn from is mostly white people and a few Orientalized Others here and there.<br/><br/>But look at it from a different perspective: Why do you say fantasy is so white? Why don't you include Chinese martial arts movies in the fantasy genre?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321318/#Comment_321318" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-20T02:10:25+00:00" title="April 20, 2011  2:10AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, why don't I just ask this question straight up:<br/><br/>Why <i>should</i> the fantasy genre be racially/ethnically diverse?

When you describe us as "white people in a white society" you're making the same error that fantasy (as a genre) does. I'm white, but I live in a country whose original inhabitants are not. People from the US do too. People from all over the world have been a part of my culture for hundreds of years. My society isn't white. To imagine it as such makes people of colour invisible. <br/><br/>Furthermore, when we imagine a fantasy world in which white people are the sole protagonists, it's inherantly political. In a different context, it would mean something different, but in the context of a wider media that is overwhelmingly white, that marginalises the experiences of non-white people, and that co-opts and erases people of colour from their own media, it means the exclusion of people of colour from yet more of our shared culture.<br/><br/>I think that's a bad thing because I think everyone benefits from a culture that is more inclusive, and more equal.<br/><br/>So, should "Game of Thrones" have black people in it?<br/><br/>It depends on the context. In isolation, it's easy to say "why not have an all-white cast, if that expresses the author's vision?" But consider it in the context of a wider media that is overwhelmingly white-centric. You have to ask why it is that this author's vision is the one being realised, whether that vision really requires an all-white caste, and if there's not something unsettling about the fact that we so consistently fantasise about worlds in which black people are margninalised.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321321/#Comment_321321" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-20T03:09:54+00:00" title="April 20, 2011  3:09AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2011 3:10AM by Simon_C.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>"Fantasy" is a white-people genre</blockquote>\n<img alt="image" src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.bvonmoney.com/media/2010/12/no-colored-allowed-black-americana.jpg"/><br/><br/>Now THAT'S uncharitable!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/netwomble" title="netwomble"><img alt="netwomble" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh6.google.com/netwomble/R5fup6Cz6tI/AAAAAAAABIQ/mSl7x0gzHo0/s144/Womble_logo_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/netwomble">netwomble</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321322/#Comment_321322" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-20T03:21:35+00:00" title="April 20, 2011  3:21AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the simple answer to all these questions is: "George R R Martin is not your bitch."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321326/#Comment_321326" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-20T05:36:45+00:00" title="April 20, 2011  5:36AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wouldn't adding people of color to a tv show that comes from a series of books that <i>doesn't</i> feature them prominently be just as condescending and politically-correct-in-a-bad-way as having the "token black guy" or the "sassy black girl friend" in an otherwise white-centric tv show?

However, the continuity of my society (Western society and the English-speaking world) is white. The history and historiography that results in this society is European in general, British in specific, and non-white people enter that society through colonization or immigration for economic reasons. If we look back into the history of this society, we start to lose all the non-white people, and any sort of ethnic fault lines get filled in by different types of white people.<br/><br/>Further, the fantasy genre comes out of two places: white people in a white society and white people in a society where racial strife is something they turn to fantasy to escape. Tolkien and Lewis were white dudes living in a white society, drawing on the myths of white people. All the classic American fantasists grew up before the 1960s. You think they hung out with black people much? Shit no. They were, essentially, also white people in a white society.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to <i>defend</i> the genre, just explain that there are reasons other than white hegemonic/colonial domination that make this show predominantly white. I'm not trying to say it <i>should</i> be a white genre, I'm saying <i>it is</i>, and <i>has been such</i> since the start. And what I suspect you're reacting negatively to is the specifically "European-ness" or "European-history-ness" that the show has inherited from the classics of the fantasy genre. Would that be a fair assumption?<br/><br/>I don't watch much television (so I can't comment on say Xena or Hercules), but I'd say non-white minorities in the US are fairly well represented (as minorities) in American fantasy movies. James Earl Jones, Tia Carrere, The Rock, and whichever Wayans brother was in the D&amp;D movie come immediately to mind. As people from more diverse backgrounds get into the fantasy genre, we'll see more diverse fantasy on-screen, but right now, where are the super-popular fantasy books written by non-white people about non-white people? Where's the great fantasy epics that draw from American or South African or South Indian post-colonial history instead of European history? And why aren't they making enough money to support film franchises?<br/><br/>So, here's another few questions for you Simon (and anybody else disappointed by mostly-white fantasy):<br/><br/>When (if?) you watch Chinese fantastic martial arts movies, are you also disappointed that these movies are not ethnically diverse?<br/><br/>If an American film company made a martial arts movie in English with an all-Asian cast, would you also be disappointed by that lack of diversity?<br/><br/>if an American film company made an ethnically-diverse fantasy film that was predominantly about racial strife -- say, black actors on one side, Asian actors on the other, with few or no white actors -- and that racial strife was <i>not resolved</i> in the film/show/etc, would that be a step in the right direction, or also disappointing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321345/#Comment_321345" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-20T11:28:50+00:00" title="April 20, 2011 11:28AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite><br/>So, here's another few questions for you Simon (and anybody else disappointed by mostly-white fantasy):<br/><br/>When (if?) you watch Chinese fantastic martial arts movies, are you also disappointed that these movies are not ethnically diverse?<br/><br/>If an American film company made a martial arts movie in English with an all-Asian cast, would you also be disappointed by that lack of diversity?</blockquote>\nThese questions assume an equality in movies and in television that just isn't there.

Remember Dark Cloud (Luo Xiaohu), the Central Asian horselord in Crouching Tiger? The Mongols, Turks, and Koreans in Musa: The Warriors? The ridiculous Muslim villain in Warriors of Heaven and Earth? The super-exoticized and hyper-sexualized Koreans in Seven Swords? They don't necessarily deal with race in a super mature fashion, often delving into stereotypes, but they do depict different ethnicities regularly and the genre is pretty fascinated with it.<br/><br/>I haven't seen Game of Thrones or read the books so I can't say anything intelligent about that. Tolkien actually deals with ethnic issues a lot, right? Because he was a historical linguist who loved the hodge-podge that the history of languages and peoples of Great Britain. Depicting ethnicity is about more than skin tone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321349/#Comment_321349" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-20T11:35:35+00:00" title="April 20, 2011 11:35AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judd, the one that's really dumb is the lack of Asian cast members in Firefly/Serenity, when everybody's supposed to speak Chinese slang.

Martin's stated goals are for his books before you go defending all-white casting as being part of his vision that HBO is just trying to do justice through its casting.<br/><br/>From the mouth of George R.R. Martin: "I think every group has good and bad people in it, whether we\u2019re talking <b>an ethnic group</b> or a religious group. So <b>I try to portray a variety,</b> especially when I have  hundreds of characters....<b>I try to reflect a whole spectrum of humanity</b> as best I can.\u201d (from here: <a href="http://www.afterelton.com/tv/2011/01/gays-game-of-thrones-series-george-martin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.afterelton.com/tv/2011/01/gays-game-of-thrones-series-george-martin</a>; emphasis mine)<br/><br/>Now, yes, he was talking about gay people, but he explicitly mentioned that he also wanted to include ethnic and religious groups in that diversity of portrayal. While inspired by the War of Roses, he clearly doesn't intend the books to be an extravaganza in whiteness and probably would have been amenable to to seeing certain kinds of diversity worked into the casting.<br/><br/>Anyway, carry on. I'm going back to happily lurking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321355/#Comment_321355" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-20T12:59:34+00:00" title="April 20, 2011 12:59PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't get the benefit of the doubt here, Judd? Everything I've written above is in reference to GRRM specifically, not the entertainment industry as a whole, although I'll do that below.<br/><br/>Jonathan, good point, although I've also seen plenty of martial arts movies entirely or mostly dominated by Han Chinese. How would you compare the films you mentioned to the Conan movies? (including Kull) Are they really less dominated by Han Chinese than Conan is dominated by white actors? Also, how visible do you think the ethnic differences in Chinese movies are to non-Chinese audiences? If Slavic actors get roles in Hollywood movies, does that mean there's ethnic diversity, even though they are white? Simon's complaining about visible diversity, after all.<br/><br/>That's not really my point, though.<br/><br/>Going back to what Renato said, (and to address Judd's remarks) Earthsea is an American fantasy about non-white people. In both the American tv version and the Japanese animated version, most characters are or look white. That's fucked up.<br/><br/>European historical movies have mostly white people in them, to reflect the history they portray. That's not fucked up.<br/><br/>If a Chinese fantasy martial arts movie that is based specifically on a fantastical version of Han Chinese history stars only Han Chinese actors, even though it is fantastical, is that fucked up? I say no.<br/><br/>If a fantasy series that is predicated on white European history and imagery inspired by white European history is filmed with predominantly white actors, is that fucked up? No, it's not. Is it fucked up to criticize Game of Thrones for Earthsea's failings? A little bit, yeah.<br/><br/>Is it fucked up that American entertainment is more concerned with pushing predominantly-white entertainment? Hell yeah, for sure. I'm not on this thread to argue against anybody's criticisms of American entertainment as a whole, although I get the feeling I'm being read that way. I would genuinely like to know the roots of Simon's complaints, above and beyond a simple "too many whiteys."<br/><br/>Anyway, is it fucked up for entertainment studios to go to white European fantasy over Chinese fantasy or American-inspired fantasy? Absolutely. Is Game of Thrones benefitting from that? No doubt. But then again, it just had waaaaay better ratings than The Wire ever did.<br/><br/>And that's the reason why complaining about it on the internet is never going to get you anything. I asked what good fantasy is out there for a reason -- if you want fantasy media that represents the transnational realities of ethnicity in the present day, if you want fantasy media that represents something other than white European history or English national mythologies, then FIND IT AND SUPPORT IT. Go buy more of Steven Erikson's books, and demand they get a tv show (to name one example). If you want fantasy that represents what you see every day in life, then write it or find it, buy it, promote it, support it, publish it, or whatever. But if there's no alternative you can point to and support, your opinion versus the statistic of 4 million viewers don't mean shit, son.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>I don't watch much television (so I can't comment on say Xena or Hercules), but I'd say non-white minorities in the US are fairly well represented (as minorities) in American fantasy movies. James Earl Jones, Tia Carrere, The Rock, and whichever Wayans brother was in the D&amp;D movie come immediately to mind. As people from more diverse backgrounds get into the fantasy genre, we'll see more diverse fantasy on-screen, but right now, where are the super-popular fantasy books written by non-white people about non-white people? Where's the great fantasy epics that draw from American or South African or South Indian post-colonial history instead of European history? And why aren't they making enough money to support film franchises?</blockquote>\nThere's a lot to unpack here.<br/><br/>Some of the examples you cite of minorities being "well represented" in fanasty movies are incredibly problematic. Can we agree that movies in which people of colour appear as sterotypes (the D&amp;D movie), or almost exclusively as villains (Conan) aren't really good examples of diversity in fantasy films?<br/><br/>As for popular books written by non-white people, I think you're displaying a certain amount of ignorance. Have you heard of Octavia Butler? Are you aware that there's a large and growing genre of fantasy and sci-fi written by black people, with a developing fandom? There are plenty of non-white fans and authors of fantasy. That you're not aware of them says more about you, and how fantasy is stereotyped, than about fantasy being a "white genre".<br/><br/>When you say "why aren't they making enough money to support film franchises?" there are a couple of responses. The Last Airbender was a show about non-white people that got turned into a film. How did that turn out? Same for Akira. I could also talk about every film adaptation of the Bible being an example of whitewashing a non-white story.<br/><br/>But I think it's more relevant to discuss the fact that we live in a white-supremacist society. That sounds inflammatory, but all I mean by that is that it promotes the ideas and experiences of white people over those of non-white people. The <i>whole society</i> is implicated in that. It's not something that is forced upon us by racist film producers, the producers are responding to, and acting within, our white-supremacist society. So <i>of course</i> films with white leads do better than films with people of colour. <i>Of course</i> there are more well-known white fantasy authors than otherwise. That's what happens when you live in a white supremacist society.<br/><br/>So no, there's nothing <i>inherantly</i> wrong with a fantasy show that's mostly about white people. But in the context of every other fantasy show that's also about white people, like pretty much every other show on television as well, <i>then we have a problem</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321381/#Comment_321381" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-20T18:17:15+00:00" title="April 20, 2011  6:17PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            According to the 2000 Census 71% of Americans identify themselves as white, so, shouldn't 71% of any given thing be about or for white people, if that thing is made for or by Americans (using the term American to mean a citizen of the United States).

I think throwing too much diversity into the mix would be off putting and seem like a deliberate attempt at political correctness.  The knights and castles and ladies in waiting all have a very medieval European aura.

Standard stories are created backwards, at least to some extent - you know what the ending is, and you trace the major influences that lead to that ending. So the reader can draw from their previous experience with other books to identify main characters and guess what will happen to them. <br/><br/>Martin purposely creates a narrative with more of a "slice of life" feel to it - you don't know that a major character is going to stick around and accomplish their goals. He purposely leads you down false paths and cuts those paths short.<br/><br/>It's a fascinating technique. Highly unusual in broadly marketed literature. At least for now. Because it's popular and making money, it will undoubtedly be copied.<br/><br/>For now, I find the technique exciting, though after several long books, it's starting to wear a bit thin. I'm hoping the narrative will tighten a bit as it goes into the home stretch. But it's quite possible that it won't. Because he's doing a lot of experimenting, he's opening up the possibility of disappointment.\n<blockquote>and I really hope they're not lining up a "she learns to love her rapist" storyline, because that would be shit.</blockquote>I've just been re-reading the first 2 books.

Every relationship is broken at some level, though many are quite fulfilling nonetheless.

Plus, it makes sense that she'd have this sort of love/hate abusive relationship with Drogo, because that's the relationship she had with Viserys, which was pretty much the only relationship she'd had in her life until she married Drogo. And she's Blood of the Dragon and a complete badass, so perhaps she can handle her intense/violent relationship with Drogo. Which sounds like I'm defending the whole "she falls in love with her rapist" trope, which, in general, I'm not, but in this context that aspect of her character and relationships make sense to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321493/#Comment_321493" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-22T06:18:50+00:00" title="April 22, 2011  6:18AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>But exploring themes of love, lust, rape, incest, marriage, prostitution, and the way all of those concepts can combine together in interesting ways is ground Martin delves quite deeply into in the series.

The pacing was much better however. We now know a lot more about the world and the characters, there's less need for exposition, the story can start kicking in. The question of Jon's mother and Cersei's children was heavy handed but I felt that way about it in the book, too. I wonder if anyone who hasn't read the books had caught it. A bunch of characters got a lot more lines, especially Tyrion, who is awesome.<br/>The camera is still rather distant and detached but I think it did get more dirty and personal a few times. Next week is the first ep with a different director, looking forward to that. It still feels rushed, we barely met the direwolves as pups in the previous episode and they're already dying and being chased away. It's hard to care. I wonder if we'll feel we know Eddard enough by the time he...<br/><br/>It's still not up to HBO's highest standards and I wonder if it will ever be (probably not), but it's certainly the best fantasy TV has ever produced (which is not saying much). I think the show will only come into its own a few more episodes in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321787/#Comment_321787" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-26T03:51:05+00:00" title="April 26, 2011  3:51AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Teataine</cite>we barely met the direwolves as pups in the previous episode and they're already dying and being chased away</blockquote>\n...which, as I recall it, was exactly my reaction when reading the books all those years ago <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321791/#Comment_321791" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-26T04:36:36+00:00" title="April 26, 2011  4:36AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it happens fast in the books, too.

There were more planes of interest in each frame. The camera was a bit looser. More over the shoulder than just masters. I'm going to chalk it all up to the pilot having been re-shot -- and lots of rushing to get the pilot done. So, that wasn't driving me nuts (Personal taste, but there it is.)<br/><br/>I wrote to a friend before the second episode aired that I've never seen Peter Dinklage (Tyrion) so comfortable in his own skin and couldn't wait to see what he was going to do as an actor in this show. And as far as I can tell, here's what he's doing: Owning It. It's kind of awesome.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was fine to much better -- because all the characters were more involved with getting things done. <br/><br/><br/>***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>For those of you who have read the books (I haven't) remember that the story beats you know are missing and thus weakening the telling are not missed by those of us who haven't read them -- and so we're not missing anything. I know how much that wolfs meant to the girls by how they interacted with them. That's dramatic narrative for you: the audience needs to be shown key behaviors... and that's it. How characters behave in action is what matters. Now, didi I get everything that was in the book? Of course not. But the last scene of Ayra and her Wolf played very moving for me -- I knew what the wolf meant to her because of what she did. As for Sansa, I assumed she was the kind of girl who didn't appreciate what she had till it was taken away from her. That might not be who she is in the book -- but it seemed to work for me.<br/><br/>Oh, and I only just realized I think what you mean by the issue of parentage -- and no, I didn't get it from the show. Again, we're only watching scene by scene. Either a scene draws me in or not. And because each scene was dramatic on it's own terms, it worked for me and I didn't put other things together yet.<br/><br/>But I've noticed the sport of most internet threads is comparing the show to the books. And the books turn on the reversals and revelations. So I realize now I better stop showing up to talk to people about it. Not only because I'll have no surprise left -- but because I'm not hoping for a pop-up version of the novels. The characters of the show are going to be <i>the</i> characters for me. My enjoyment or failure to enjoy will be based on what actually happens onscreen--not by any success or failure in terms of a comparison to the page.<br/><br/>That's not me being huffy or anything, by the way. People who love something are going to talk about it. And people LOVE the books, its clear. I just realized that, for my own enjoyment, I better stay away from the folks who read the books!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321795/#Comment_321795" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-26T06:38:34+00:00" title="April 26, 2011  6:38AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2011 6:40AM by Robert_Bohl.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something RPG.net is doing that I would love to see here is an extremely strict no-spoiler thread (as in not even mentioning promotional material).

And I guess I pictured them as much more mongolic steppes people (and/or Sarmatians, Avars, etc) in my mind... but that's, obviously, my personal bias.<br/><br/>Plus, Tyrion slapping Joff.<br/><br/>It's also nice that they're keeping things moving and *not* trying to focus and explain every little detail they reproduce from the books: they're there for the people that have read the books, the others won't miss them if they don't notice (just like the LotR movies were full of little details only a book-geek would have noticed). <br/><br/>Let's hope the positive trend keeps going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason" title="Joe_Beason"><img alt="Joe_Beason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_Beason">Joe_Beason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321927/#Comment_321927" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-27T09:03:44+00:00" title="April 27, 2011  9:03AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Daenerys' story line is the hardest to portray, because at this point in the book its so isolated.  Everyone else's have been criss-crossing: Arya shows up in the Ned chapters, Jon shows up in the Catelyn chapters, etc.  Additionally, the Dothraki culture is less accessible to the audience than the more standard Western fantasy tropes of Westeros.  So you get less screen time plus more foreign culture, and wind up with more cliches.  I hope this improves, because her relationship with the Dothraki is a big part of the narrative.
