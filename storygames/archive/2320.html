                    I could do with some help on this.<br/><br/>Last night, I played GRS with my girlfriend. If you like, <a href="http://www.catchyourhare.com/files/Recruitment4.pdf" rel="nofollow">have a look at the latest rules draft</a>: it's not essential, though.<br/><br/>So the set-up is this: there's these guys, the GRS, and they're sent into a nightclub to convert a straight. They get through the club by charm, seduction and pure luck: not by violence.<br/><br/>The GRS have different skills, from useful ("Banging and yelling at technical devices until they work") to useless ("Baking a nice Victoria sponge"). Each has his own seduction style (e.g. "Targets lonely straights and bonds over their shared rejection"). Each also have issues: Baggage (e.g. "Last boyfriend dumped him, saying he was too old and boring"), a Neurosis (e.g. "If in an untidy room, must make some effort to tidy it up") and other quirks.<br/><br/>So the Squad make their way through the nightclub. They get past the security systems and seduce the guards. And these conflicts, especially the seductions, are the best part of the game. They're funny.<br/><br/>But the game seems like just a series of conflicts. Now, they're fun, and that's a big start: they remind me of the conflicts in Best Friends.<br/><br/>And, although our game was fun, this worries me. It needs some narrative structure, I think: something to make sense of the conflicts. I think the answer may lie in the Baggage, but I'm not sure. In fact, I'm stuck.<br/><br/>Has anyone got any suggestions? How can I make it more than a series of conflicts? What <i>should</i> a game like this be about, really? It's something to do with relationships, I think. Aaaargh. I'm missing something bloody obvious here and I can't put my finger on it.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>

<em>Last night, I played Gay Recruitment Squad with my girlfriend.</em><br/><br/>First off, that's classic.<br/><br/>As to the question, what about the guy they're trying to convert?  Is this a specific target that the players know from the start of the game ("Your mark tonight is Geoffry Brown, a joiner from Leeds in town for a convention."), or are they breaking into a club to convert anybody who's handy?<br/><br/>Alternately, maybe the club that they break into <em>just happens</em> to be jam-packed full of people that their issues relate to?<br/><br/>Did you playtest all the way through?  What did the ending feel like?                        </div>

                            I'll give you a dollar if the conflict system can be bypassed by a mechanic called "Kiss And Make Up."<br/><br/>Edit: Hey! The nightclub has a name now! Good choice.                        </div>

<blockquote>As to the question, what about the guy they're trying to convert?  Is this a specific target that the players know from the start of the game ("Your mark tonight is Geoffry Brown, a joiner from Leeds in town for a convention.")...</blockquote>
Yes, exactly.
<blockquote>Alternately, maybe the club that they break into<em>just happens</em>to be jam-packed full of people that their issues relate to?</blockquote>
I think this is the right idea. Or, at least, dealing with their issues and dealing with the mission will coincide in a weird way.<br/><br/>It's like the way that, in an action movie, the hero's weaknesses have to be overcome to succeed. For example, if the hero has vertigo, you know that the last fight will take place in a very, very high place. And that the vertigo will be referenced a couple of times before that in the movie.<br/><br/>But then how does all that tie into the conflicts?
<blockquote>Did you playtest all the way through?  What did the ending feel like?</blockquote>
No, it was getting a bit late, and we'd tested enough to realise there was <i>something</i> wrong that I had to sort out.<br/><br/>Larry, yes, I'll remember that and name a mechanic after it. And The Black Orchid was our student nightclub.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>
