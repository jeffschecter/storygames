Inspired by a few things Remi has said about how he runs series creation in <em>Primetime Adventures</em>, I'm noodling over a setting-building sort of engine and I want to give its basic ideas a test drive.<br/><br/>Basically, I want to have anybody who wants to participate help to create and develop a setting, and use this thread to do so.  In short form, this will be a guided riffing activity, with everybody riffing off of the ideas posted before them.  The idea is that the setting that emerges will hopefully be something that folks would enjoy using as the backdrop for a relatively long-form game.<br/><br/>So if you'd like to participate, here's how it works:<br/><br/>1. <strong>Turns:</strong> You may not make two consecutive posts.  Let somebody else go before you go again.<br/>2. <strong>Quoting:</strong> Your post must quote a portion of a prior post, and then respond to it starting with either "Yes, and..." or "Yes, but..."  <em>As of Phase Two</em>, you must quote two portions of two prior posts, with your contribution tying them together.<br/>2a. <strong>Yes And...</strong> posts add details that push an idea or theme forward.  If the grand vizier was scheming in the first post, your Yes And post may introduce his conspirators.<br/>2b. <strong>Yes But...</strong> posts qualify or challenge an idea or theme put forward by a prior post.  The Yes But to the grand vizier could be that he is horrified at the excesses of the Shah and seeks to replace him with a noble and just government.<br/>3. <strong>Be concise:</strong> Posts should not be any longer than ten lines or so.<br/>4. <strong>Cross Posts:</strong> Occasionally we'll get some cross-posts that are both addressing the same topic.  If this happens to you and your posts hits the forum second (or third), it is your responsibility to either remove your post or edit it so it no longer conflicts.  You might want to throw in an "Under Revision" flag at the top of it first so other players don't quote off of that post.<br/>5. <strong>Phases:</strong> The game will proceed in phases.  The first phase works exactly as described in points <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231-4&amp;Mode=like">#1-4</a>.  Later phases will amend, modify, or add new wrinkles.  I will occasionally post "END OF PHASE AT 4PM PST" or something.  Get your posts in before that time and then I'll post the next phase's changes.  Play then continues.  (Disclosure: I will use this to fine-tune and poke at the procedure as we go.)<br/><br/>Again, just to belabor the point, the goal in this thread is NOT to tell a story.  The goal in this thread is to elaborate a conflict-ridden situation in a conflict-ridden setting that is just aching for some protagonists to come and start knocking shit over.  Think of it as an exercise in creating unbalanced situations.<br/><br/>What follows are three 'starter posts' to serve as examples and as seeds, and then I encourage anybody and everybody to jump in!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71419/#Comment_71419" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-23T10:38:26+00:00" title="May 23, 2007 10:38AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The planet Hyperborea orbits close to its star, Arel, and is a hot, desiccated planet because of it.

The most lucrative among them, however, is the canal across the peninsula, dug out by the last exhaust of a ship's plasma drive.  The canal serves as a trading link between city-states on either side of the peninsula -- and drives all that trade directly through Tripoli.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71421/#Comment_71421" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-23T10:38:49+00:00" title="May 23, 2007 10:38AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2007 10:39AM by Josh Roby.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Joshua BishopRoby</cite>When human colonists came here fleeing the collapse of the Pax Galacti, they crash-landed their starcraft into the northern pole</blockquote>\n<strong>Yes, But...</strong><br/><br/>Unknown to the refugees at the north pole, another fleet of ships arrived in the Arel system after them.

Instead, a number of the converted cities nearby were reconquered and made Catholic again.  Nevertheless, a number of nearby city-states are still Anabaptist, or harbor organized underground movements to become Anabaptist again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/QHudspeth" title="QHudspeth"><img alt="QHudspeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://quentinhudspeth.com/journal/wp-content/themes/atahualpa/images/H%20Logo%20super%20extra%20small.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/QHudspeth">QHudspeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75426/#Comment_75426" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T12:11:25+00:00" title="June 13, 2007 12:11PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Roger</cite>...Due to the axial tilt of the planet, this area receives constant sunlight for half its year, constant darkness for the other half. </blockquote>\nYes, and...<br/><br/>The Phreaks come out at Night...<br/>Hyperborea has very little remaining indigenous animal life, the majority being small, unobtrusive, herbivores that eke out a meager existence among the desert's sparse flora. The Phreaks are a major exception to this rule. The huge nocturnal creatures seem to be omnivorous, feasting on plants, animals, and carrion in equal measure. Phreaks resemble nothing so much as demonic cockroaches. Their leathery, blood red faces, are set on vaguely leonine heads atop long necks. Their round lamprey mouths are ringed with spidery pedipalps, which they use for feeding, and their multiple eyes look uncomfortably goatish. Phreaks can maneuver their long, squat bodies very rapidly on ten mulitisegmented chitinous legs, and can even rear up on their hindquarters to effect a centaurlike pose. They have always shunned human contact, but now the slow expansion of the colonies places ever stronger pressure on Phreak society. During the latest Night several incursions of Phreaks into the smaller towns have lead to bloodshed on both sides of the conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75458/#Comment_75458" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T13:26:57+00:00" title="June 13, 2007  1:26PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2007 2:25PM by Sydney Freedberg.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andrew Kenrick</cite>Both Catholic and Anabaptist agents work within the city to bring down the regime and replace it with something a little more unfriendly, even going so far as to work together to ferment dissent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>In recent history, the Anabaptists sheltered in Tripoli used it as a base of operations in bringing down nearby city-states that had declared themselves Catholic.

After the conflict, this corps was institutionalized as the Confraternity for Extraordinary Reconciliation. Reporting directly to the Doge rather than to the Council, this body's members are known formally as Confraternes Extraordinary, semiformally as Reconciliators, and informally as "the Doge's Dogs." These "Dogs" have for all practical purposes the powers of judge, jury, and executioner, and a wide mandate to investigate potential disorder in the many fractious, often religiously ghettoized districts of Tripoli itself and in the neighboring client states. It is their responsibility to maintain Tripoli's fragile peace against agents of the Catholic hierarchy, Anabaptist rabble-rousers, mysterious Wanderers, rampaging Phreaks, and the ordinary, ugly hatreds of the citizenry.<br/><br/>* The carefully nondenominational name for the conflict preferred by Tripolitan authorities; it is called "the Tripolitan Crusade" by most Catholics and "the War of the Catholic League" by most Anabaptists.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75465/#Comment_75465" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T13:42:42+00:00" title="June 13, 2007  1:42PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<strong>PHASE TWO</strong><br/><br/>I like Sydney's style.
