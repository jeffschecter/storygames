They don't seem too terribly dynamic to me. They're great for general hubub, but most seem so dry: "The book has 128 pages. The cover is pretty. Chapter 1: I like it. Chapter 2: It had some stuff I didn't understand. Chapter 3: It is nice." snoooooore.<br/><br/>Practically, I only really pay attention to reviews where they were written by someone I know has played or run the game, not just read it. A readthrough review tells me why I should or shouldn't buy a game book. A playtest review hopefully tells me why I should or shouldn't PLAY a game. Most reviews on RPGNet are readthrough reviews.<br/><br/>It wouldn't hurt to ALSO post a review to RPGNet, but if you're looking to see a solid review of the game, both as a teaching tool to play the game, and the kind of play that it produces, then somewhere else might be the answer. I see this kind of review usually in Actual Play posts or on people's livejournals. I hope that more of these kinds of reviews make it to RPGNet, or else here.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78386/#Comment_78386" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T09:10:58+00:00" title="June 28, 2007  9:10AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As an example of the above, I present two reviews from this week:<br/><br/>An Elegant Review of Reign that tells me about the binding of the book and a dry review of the mechanics, but fuckall of why I would be interested in playing it:<br/><a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13062.phtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13062.phtml</a><br/>It was read. It wasn't played.  I simply no longer find these reviews useful unless the game is horribly/comically flawed (to stay away from it). If the game is, say, at a glance of Average or Greater quality based on a glance-through, I either want to hear some reviewing based actual play, or I want to hear nothing at all. Unless, like, all copies of the game have a binding that explodes when you touch it or something.<br/><br/>A Not All That Elegantly Written Review of a game called "Super System 2nd Edition"<br/><a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13065.phtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13065.phtml</a><br/>This review wasn't written as nicely/in depth as the previous review, and it's just not as well organized as the above.  But the guy talks about stuff he did with the game in the playtest of it that he ran. I've got a better picture of what happens at the table.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just because book reports seem all dispassionate and dry, that I just don't get anything from them. However, when I read people's experiences with a game (for better, worse, or average), they tend to then review the book with their own experiences firmly in mind. Those are far more helpful to me.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78388/#Comment_78388" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T09:14:44+00:00" title="June 28, 2007  9:14AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Continuing my thought...<br/><br/>...in fact, I'd like to see reviews of a game that rank a game from 1-5 (or even 0-3!), where the review factors are:<br/>1) Quality of the Book<br/>2) How fun the game was, with at least one example.<br/>3) Book as a Reference (did it really provide the fun in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>? Was it a good read but a poor reference? Or a poor read but a good reference? Neither? Both?)<br/>4) Swing vote<br/><br/>"How fun the game was" is objective. I played Capes once and didn't have a lot of fun. Someone else played Capes and had a fuckload of fun. If we both were to write our reviews, they will end up being quite different. However, the reader, seeing both, will be able to form a better opinion of the game from seeing what we did with it.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78413/#Comment_78413" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T10:20:47+00:00" title="June 28, 2007 10:20AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2007 10:21AM by johnzo.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just want to take this opportunity to link to my favorite rpg.net review ever:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/9/9372.phtml" rel="nofollow">Frank Sronce reviews Savage Worlds.</a> <br/><br/>At the end of that review, you know exactly what Savage is all about.

At the very least they get to watch the movie in question for free. Now I assume established RPG reviewers also get review copies and the like, but I mean based on my experience with Game Chef this year (writing reviews for all of 5 games) it's important to have some kind of incentive going on. If I had to actually play all those games I'm sure I wouldn't have finished a single review.<br/><br/>I'm not just talking about money, or even primarily about free stuff -- the incentive to write the GC reviews was mostly a feeling of wanting to contribute to and participate in the competition. Maybe a 'guild' would help with that, but I think a serious commitment from people in the community to support (and <i>promote</i>) such a review site would be essential.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78444/#Comment_78444" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T11:08:41+00:00" title="June 28, 2007 11:08AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2007 11:10AM by Graham.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, that's very useful.<br/><br/>Listen, let's try this.

What Andy said is good stuff. <br/><br/>Also, prompt reviews are good. But there is also a way in which I do not like the "now" cycle of reviews that happens around trad games. Many trad games publish on an almost magazine level of publication for supplements (core books are slightly different) -- and so most of their sales happen in the first two or three months (by which I mean upwards of 90% in some cases, and many companies shred and leave out of print after that, as there isn't a point in keeping in stock). There is thus a huge need to have the reviews happen now. As a result there is a lot of push before a release to get preview copies into reviewer hands. (Which, I must admit, is nice. Geek status and all that.) And there is a huge issue around having the first review of a product, the most reviews in the first month, and after threeish months no one really cares anymore. The reviews are out and done, the book is out and done, and everyone has moved on to the next new things. Its a tred mill, and the reviews that are produced on the mill are often not as good as they could be -- even from the best reviewers. Because much as you might get a playtest session or two of a game in before you do the review one week after the book is released, how much of the games full inner structure do you really understand? <br/><br/>So while I do think that we need a place for quick reviews of new games (just to spread the word the game is out, if nothing else), I think that the drive towards needing a review done NOW and having all the reviews having to happen quickly after the game comes out can be damaging. Especially as a lot of Indie games don't have that same magazine style sales cycle (Sorcerer is near evergreen from what I understand, and games like Dogs and PTA keep selling years after release). Prompt reviews are good things -- but I also think we need reviews that come over time, with deeper levels of play and understanding.<br/><br/>So maybe what we're looking at is reviews with different goals? Reviews to let people know a game is out and give a quick impressionistic take, reviews with some actual play to let people know what its like to first get into the game, and reviews much later in the cycle once people have attained mastery and full understanding of the system in a truly, deeply critical way? <br/><br/>(And yes, I will post my Dogs review soonish. I finally understand the game well enough that I feel ready to really review the damn thing.)<br/><br/>Edit from crosspost: And folks -- do take Graham up on his offer.

So my interest in writing them totally dried up.<br/><br/>I think that's why I'm kinda pushing people to at least *also* post their reviews here in the "Game Report" category: Not to just foster a review DB here (which probably wouldn't be that extensive), but because if other reviewers happen to be in it for the same reasons I was, then there will be both:<br/><br/>1) Eyes on your review, at least for a few days.<br/>2) Discussion on your review and play report, especially if you engage the audience (or ask questions to the audience).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78471/#Comment_78471" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T11:33:46+00:00" title="June 28, 2007 11:33AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: eruditus</cite>So, that's 52 games a year with about a dozen bonus games bringing the rounded number to about 60 games.</blockquote>\nIf you published 60 game reviews a year I would conclude that a) you are crazy and b) I cannot take your analysis of most of these games very seriously.

To that end it's my position that a single play session often doesn't provide a good and accurate basis for a review.  Why is that?  There are a couple of reasons:<br/><br/>1. Often a group is just getting new rules down at the end of the first session.  My crew took to SOTC like a gamer to cheetoes, but they absolutely were not as involved with the system as they were the next time they played.  In general I find folk have become comfortable with most rules enough to get a good feel for the game after 3 or 4 game sessions - until then it's often a big learning process.  I'd like to say it's less so with indie games, but then my eyes glance over at Burning Empires and some other very robust games and I have to say that it's really varied.  I can't imagine teaching a group Burning Empires well enough to really talk about it in play with one or two game sessions - some would argue you need a full campaign to write a playtest review of that one considering how it's structured.  In any event, if you want the group to take advantage of the system as a group sitting down for a dozen sessions would please consider that 1 session isn't enough.<br/><br/>2. Weird things happen.  Your friend just had a fight with her boyfriend, everyone's sick, Bill had a rough day at work - whatever.  Often things will click or not in one session not based on the game but on the group's current mindset.  Running 3 or 4 sessions results in a more balanced play experience that lets you discount any moodiness or random fortune that influenced a single session.<br/><br/>3. One shots tend to have a different organization than short campaigns and players will make different decisions.  Multiple sessions encourage players to make decisions with at least a little longevity in mind - just as they would in a longer campaign.  This is the weakest reason and flat out doesn't apply where the game is meant for one shots.<br/><br/>I mostly write what RPG.net calls "Capsule" reviews, so I'm saying I wouldn't mark it as Playtest without more experience.  I usually note the results of a single session in the review thread or mention it briefly in passing, but I've never considered it sufficient to provide a reader with an accurate understanding of the game in play.  If you want reviews that discuss the game in play at least consider whether a single session or two has really given you an understanding of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78526/#Comment_78526" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T12:36:52+00:00" title="June 28, 2007 12:36PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andrew Kenrick</cite>Wouldn't this be quite a good use for the Story Games Codex/wiki?</blockquote>\nI think so.

Capsule reviews are still very useful though, especially since Playtest reviews are so infrequent (and often have no more detail than the Capsule reviews - if you don't want to discuss actual play don't write a Playtest review).<br/><br/>So I agree with everybody! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78529/#Comment_78529" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T12:44:19+00:00" title="June 28, 2007 12:44PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><cite>Posted By: Andrew Kenrick</cite>Wouldn't this be quite a good use for the Story Games Codex/wiki?</blockquote>\nI think so.

Dedicated response threads, Gaming Index integration, comprehensive product information in the review sidebar, links to other products, etc.  No RPG site or Wiki offers what RPG.net offers, which isn't surprising considering that the site has a half time employee who focuses on making the review system kick butt.<br/><br/>Plus, if you want to help out the indie movement while you're at it these reviews are going to get a lot more exposure there.

What I should have said above is, in actual play, <i>for the right group</i>, T&amp;T soars, baby...<br/><br/>The beautiful thing about a good actual play review, one that includes some biographical information on the group, is that I can judge the game's merits by how closely the reviewing group's preferences match my own.  With a capsule review, I have to kind of squint at it and read it sideways to understand the reviewer's prejudices, and, more importantly, understand the foundations of those prejudices, whether they're grounded in actual play or in some weird fanboyism that I may not relate to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78595/#Comment_78595" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-28T15:41:31+00:00" title="June 28, 2007  3:41PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zach Welhouse</cite>Have you been working on anything since I sent you that actual play report of WMHS all that time ago?
