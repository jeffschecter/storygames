Still, I think under their 3.5 rules-plated exteriors lurk the hearts of story gamers just waiting for release.  To that end, I'm trying to figure out ways to get them to cast aside a few of the traditionalist trappings, specifically hit points/wound points/vitality points/anything that renders a character's lifeforce into a numerical score.  I'm looking for something simple, easily kept track of, and -- well -- cool.

They may get applied to a player character as a result of a failure, or a compromised success. Conditions generally give a penalty to a swath of actions (some affect all actions, some affect physical, some affect mental) Players can roll to remove one condition during downtime between missions.<br><br>Anyway, the idea is that you come up with a set of stackable "state" penalties that apply to the characters. You'll need to do some experimenting to figure out the severity of the penalties, how easy they can be removed, and under what circumstances. Obviously, this sort of system is going to greatly change how combat feels, as compared to a blow-by-blow HP system.<br><br>It might be worth trying to figure out how your group likes to play combat, because tactical gamers may not jump at the idea of resolving an entire combat with a single opposed skill roll. You might want to try a game, or even just a session, that throws its mechanical weight behind something other than combat.

They declare the name of the condition, and the GM decides on "what the condition wants" if it gets too big and becomes a problem.   When you block, the duration or condition "soaks up" the successes of the opponent (lengthening the duration, or increasing the number of bonus dice that the condition gives someone who calls on it).<br/><br/>If you have a condition at four, you can't block actions that have the same intent <i>as the actions that gave you the condition</i>.  Plus, the condition becomes active, and starts to do hostile stuff.<br/><br/>So, I try to stab you inna face.  You decide, in response, to beat me black and blue.  We roll, I win, with three successes.  I declare as my victory that you are now dead.  You don't like that.  You declare that you are blocking.   I name the condition "stabbed inna face", and you take it (at a rating of two, as it comes out).  The GM says that the intent of the condition, if it goes hostile, is to put you in a coma.<br/><br/>...Uh, that might be more detail than you need.

I got annoyed by hit points because they're an underutilized (in my play, that is), clumsy and excessive mechanic, not to speak of unfair when the dice don't favour you. Changing them into temporary penalties on ability checks, however, makes them match the rest of a modern rpg system much better. Works in almost any game: just instead of having each character have a certain number of hit points pile on penalty chips when they get adverse consequences in situations. Then have permanent shit fall on them when and if the points cross some threshold, such as the character's Constitution. Let the player choose between losing an eye or falling prisoner to the bad guys for some added dramatic flair. In D&amp;D context I supplement this solution by getting rid of the whole to-hit/to-damage dice rolling scheme, of course.<br/><br/>If I were trying to sneak up on a mode, to loan a phrase, I'd probably start by not using those mechanics. Play D&amp;D but don't have combats, unless they're appropriate drama-wise. This will be a general panacea, as if the players like the direction of play, they'll sooner or later realize themselves that the D&amp;D mechanics are not serving the stuff you are now communally developing. Then it's easier to introduce a new system altogether.<br/><br/>(Of course, one should Google "can't sneak up on mode" before even considering that direction...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden" title="ScottOden"><img alt="ScottOden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden">ScottOden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184490/#Comment_184490" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T07:38:26+00:00" title="December 21, 2008  7:38AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, all!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs expected, you guys have brought up some great ideas.  My group loves the blow-by-blow method of combat, and we've imported the critical tables from <i>Dark Heresy</i> to make it a little extra dangerous.  So, we have a mechanic in place that allows a character to die horribly in a single blow (though rather than ad lib the effect, the GM simply reads the stock description from <i>Dark Heresy</i>).<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the notion that each successful blow provokes a need for a saving throw.  Pass the test and you have some kind of light wound that doesn't interfere with your ability; fail it and you start to lose proficiency.

It just got in the way, and delayed us from getting to what we really wanted to play with: Consequences.  <br><br>So, if you do damage or otherwise succeed, you immediately create a consequence Aspect on your opponent.  There are levels of consequences that tie directly to how many shifts you succeeded by on your "attack" (something like 1-2 shifts: mild consequence that lasts for a round, 3-5: moderate consequence that lasts for the scene, and 6+ is severe and permanent or semi-permanent).  They're all, of course, taggable Aspects, so conflicts get hot and heavy pretty quickly.  These all lead up to a final save vs. final defeat, a la M&amp;M and True20. <br><br>To keep the progression from becoming too linear, we opted to make this final save a constant threat.  Mild stuff you can shake off.  But anytime you take a severe hit, or pass a threshold of moderate consequences, you gotta save.  Further, the difficulty for the save ramps up according to how many moderate and severe aspects you're carrying.  So you'll never be whittled down by nicks and scratches, but you will be in more danger of having those nicks and scratches taken advantage of by savvy foes, for that coup de grace that's waiting around every corner.<br><br>It's still in beta, but so far, this has worked out really, really well.  Conflict resolution is now evocative on the Wushu level, because there are no more "I swing.  8+2+1...11 damage.  Next."  Plus, it's just super versatile (thank you, FATE!) and gets right to the good stuff.  Case in point, the very first situation we used it for was a scene where our characters attempted to pick up these girls in a Vegas night club.  It totally worked.  It worked as well as the car chase/shoot-out on the tarmac at the airport.  It was so natural, easy, and fun...I was sold.<br><br>There are some bugs, though.  Scaling the number of shifts for different severities is tricky.  One on one, it's predictable...but in a group, you can tag the living crap out of these consequences, as well as Maneuvers, so I'm not certain that's the ideal spread.  Also, although it's not really a flaw: since we completely abandoned the SoTC skill lists in favor of Making Shit Up, we realized we didn't have a set of go-to, generic attributes to make our "death" saves against.  (Woops!)  But worst of all, in conflicts that drag, it can be tough to keep the 12th mild consequence from your left hook as fresh as the first 11. <br><br>Still, laying a "Flailing human torch" severe consequence on someone after nailing them with a flamethrower is pretty fantastic in my book, and it just seems so natural.  True to SoTC, though, you could feasibly get the same mechanical result (tag it for a +2) with a ham-handed punch or harsh language or whatever.  If that's important to you, then you'll probably agree that, sometimes, rolling two handfuls of dice for damage just...FEELS better.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185750/#Comment_185750" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-02T14:25:18+00:00" title="January  2, 2009  2:25PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ScottOden</cite>I guess the "why" ultimately boils down to: I've been playing rpg's in a traditional tactics-heavy style for nigh upon 30 years; I'm bored and want to try something new . . . and I'm going to drag my friends along with me -- kicking and screaming, if need be <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Worst case is they'll hate it, bitch-and-moan me into submission, and force a return to our accustomed style of play with no hard feelings.  Best case . . . they'll love it and five new story-gamers will be born.</blockquote>\nIf they are your friends, instead of passively aggressively pushing them down a new path only to have them passively aggressively push you back, why not talk with them about what you want from gaming?  Tell them what's not working for you.  Even if they are resistant, you should be able to work out a compromise. After all, you're all buddies.  One of two things might happen. By discussing it you'll find common points of interest, and from there, be able to find a game system that focuses on those (or worst case, find something close and emphasize them).  Or, you'll find there is very little crossover, but since you are friends and want to game and hang out, can work out trying new games into your regular schedule - like maybe every 5th session, instead of playing the ongoing D&amp;D game, you try a new game (it helps that most story games work very well as one-shots, too).  Then, if they don't have a good time, they can give it their all knowing that next week its back to D&amp;D.  And there's always the chance that one or more will love it, or at the very least, learn something about gameplay they didn't think of before and grow as a gamer making whatever you play better.<br/><br/>Either way, hacking a system to get what you want is probably the best way to ensure that they hate it. Mainly because it won't produce a different experience and has a high risk of simply being broken.  They'll think that was your goal and then want to go back to the old system. In other words, trying to get rid of hit points or any other system to reduce the tactical nature of the game is most likely to make it a miserable experience for everyone involved.<br/><br/>Even with trying new stuff out, you'll probably want to hit upon things they like. This is supposed to be fun, after all. There are a lot of games that allow players to push the rules to their limits (i.e. play tactically) that also have story focused gameplay.  Give HeroQuest, In A Wicked Age, or Capes a try.  IAWA in particular seems to be easily loved among D&amp;D adherents as well as people sick and tired of 3.5 (speaking as one of them).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ElectricPaladin" title="ElectricPaladin"><img alt="ElectricPaladin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayStressed.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ElectricPaladin">ElectricPaladin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185756/#Comment_185756" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-02T15:24:40+00:00" title="January  2, 2009  3:24PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Alvin and everyone else who has been questioning your very intentions.<br/><br/>Sometimes we have to just buckle down and admit that people have different tastes. My girlfriend is more of a "I want my guy to be awesome and do awesome things" kind of roleplayer - I have a bit more of the "I want to tell awesome stories even if that means my guy sucks and does terrible things" to me. She's more into immersion, I'm more into narrative. We compromise, we deal, we get along. The key is this: no one's fun is bad. Fun is never bad. Fun is good. It makes you happy. Even thinking the word "fun" makes you smile.<br/><br/>Compromise can sometimes mean stretching your boundaries, however, which is why Alvin is completely right: get them to check out some stuff you like, and maybe they'll like it, too. However, you also need to admit that as long as you play with them, you are sometimes going to have to play the kinds of games they like. If it turns out they like your kinds of games, you might be in luck and get to do your thing once a month or so - maybe if you're really lucky, they'll go in for it for a whole campaign once in a while. If you aren't lucky, though, they won't like your stuff, and then you're screwed.<br/><br/>So, here's the final arithmetic: you like X, they like Y. There's more of them then there are of you. If you all share and play nice, you can find a compromise. If you don't all share and play nice - or a compromise doesn't work out - you need to find a new group.<br/><br/>Remember - just because you can say nice things about the games you like doesn't mean that your games are <i>right</i> or <i>good</i> and theirs are <i>wrong</i> or <i>bad</i>. They can say nice things about D&amp;D, too. This isn't a problem about game theory, it's a problem about friends who want to play together and figuring out how.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185778/#Comment_185778" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-02T22:27:01+00:00" title="January  2, 2009 10:27PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark is my hero today.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden" title="ScottOden"><img alt="ScottOden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden">ScottOden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185799/#Comment_185799" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-03T08:29:10+00:00" title="January  3, 2009  8:29AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All good points.

I'm not our usual game master, but as we sometimes rotate out (we have 4 campaigns going right now -- three with the same GM and one with another) I thought I'd try to find an angle into story gaming that they *would* enjoy.  That means using the system we all love (D&amp;D;) and making it less crunchy, less hidebound to the conventions of traditional gaming.  If it fails, no harm done.

In other words, everyone else is having fun, but you need some help.<br/><br/>You might consider something like The Shadow of Yesterday.

When a character runs out of them, they meet their fate, which can even be something besides dying, such as becoming a villainous NPC.<br/><br/>Players can spend DP equal to their character's class' hit die (this is to make things fair between the different classes) for a reroll, and you can come up with different uses for DP as you see fit.<br/><br/>This has the advantage of not changing how HPs are already used, while adding a new twist. So players do not have to change the way they currently play, but have the option to.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi-Who-Babbles.</cite>Another method...<br/><br/>*snip*</blockquote>\nThat's....pretty fucking cool, especially the bit about duration and intent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
