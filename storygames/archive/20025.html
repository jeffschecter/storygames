The concept is, broadly, wuxia action/melodrama (more the former) in a setting inspired by wuxia ancient China (that is: it is not ancient china in space), and space opera (such as Firefly - wandering heroes who swear at each other in mandarin <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>)<br/><br/>The 10,000 Stars is the galaxy - the overall setting. Precise measurements are not relevant nor provided. There are Five Heavens (firefly does a similar thing) largely under the control of the powerful Iron Emperor. Beyond his reach is Jianghu Space wherein communities lie off the beaten path. Those that are connected form a community based on the ancient values of the ancient kingdom of Xia which remains the cultural peak of civilisation. Within this are Heroes whose assumed purpose for adventuring is to rail against the expansionist and oppressive Empire. Simple, classic, righteous.<br/><br/>That's a very brief overview.<br/><br/>The purpose of this is to help clarify a concept. Heroes have access to a variety of abilities whose total 'value' cannot exceed their level of Inner Power; Chi. One of those abilities is similar to the Courtier Secret Arts in Legends of the Wulin (a wayward inspiration for its romanticised view of wuxia and its perhaps flawed approximation of chinese folk medicine for its magic system): the ability to use one's 'reputation' (a universal currency represented by Xia points earned through heroism and honour) against others, exploiting their moral/social/emotional weaknesses. <br/><br/>The idea is that such abilities would be that they are the purview of a Junzi (the Confucian term for a moral and upstanding person - Confucius won't exist in this setting) Guild. This training is a bit like Inara (Firefly) and her 'companion training', except in a more 'kungfu' milieu. Companion training in Firefly is more than just being good at 'whoring', it's about reading people and mastering social environments. <br/><br/>But is this something that belongs under the remit of the Empire? Or something that flourishes beyond? That is what I cannot decide? Would heroes who know the Junzi arts have learned them from time spent in the Empire? How do they fit into a society, if beyond, that cleaves to the noble values of the Xia (the usual stuff: justice, bravery, honour and tradition)?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442819/#Comment_442819" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-13T14:31:37+00:00" title="February 13, 2015  2:31PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of super courtesan adventurers, and see no reason why the institution could not exist both within and without the space empire. Perhaps it is one of those organizations the members of which somewhat bridge the divide, providing everyday diplomatic resources for people having to deal with the other side. An imperial would perhaps prefer to have a Junzi expert along when traversing the wild frontier for the sake of their diplomatic skills, and frontiersmen would rather leave writing the complex calligraphy required of civilized correspondence to trained professionals of the guild.<br/><br/>Of course the Junzi Guild would probably look rather different in its practices in the imperial space as compared to the outlands. I don't see this as much of a problem, as obviously a space courtesan guild needs to adapt to local mores anyway to be able to be socially accepted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442820/#Comment_442820" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-13T15:03:01+00:00" title="February 13, 2015  3:03PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm starting to think maybe something like Judge Dee would be a better model, rather than Space Escorts (male or female!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442822/#Comment_442822" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-13T16:10:49+00:00" title="February 13, 2015  4:10PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They can be both! You want your character archetypes to be strong, each worthy of carrying an epic on its lonesome. This means making space for the players to make the concept their own, and that in turn means embracing plurality.<br/><br/>On some worlds Jungzi guild may achieve a position of cultural authority making them unparalleled mediators, while on others they may be little more than highly-paid courtesans. This ambivalence in status makes space adventuring all the more interesting, reminiscent of the way e.g. thieves, druids and monks have their own "private realms" in D&amp;D. By day you're a down-trodden thief, scum of the earth, but by night, under the streets, different rules apply. Similarly the social influence and precise position of the Junzi Guild can wax and wane with geography and time.<br/><br/>For an example treatment of this sort of ideologically elevated prostitution, consider how Glorantha material deals with the religious cult of the God of Love, Uleria. The institutions related to Uleria range from simple temple prostitution to coffee shops (amity being a form of love, Uleria is also the god of friendship).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442832/#Comment_442832" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-13T22:11:14+00:00" title="February 13, 2015 10:11PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really want to focus on prostitution. Courtiers (in LotW) aren't hookers and can encompass a variety of people with a common ability to influence others. Essentially the same here.<br/><br/>However this ability, which is what this ultimately is in game terms (a kewl powerz for heroes to choose), needs an origin. The Courtier works by manipulating, essentially, the Confucian values against or for another ("you cannot strike me down, it would be unrighteous and your ancestors will be deeply offended!"). So there needs to be something that invented all this. <br/><br/>I also think there needs to be books (electronic or otherwise), Classics that contain knowledge of virtuous behaviour and principle, that the Empire has outlawed. In fact the Emperor probably has his own 'little red book' instead. By ciomparison it is a more Legalist state: harsh rules to maintain order.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442833/#Comment_442833" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-13T22:34:28+00:00" title="February 13, 2015 10:34PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find that I generally like your setting stuff.

So it's about having an awesome 'mien' (to quote Deadlands, though i think the root of that word is also Chinese) and forcing people to cleave to honour and virtue either to their benefit or detriment.<br/><br/>*Transcendental Vigour is an awesome phrase for inner power (ie, Chi) that comes from a fan online (and probably illegal) translation of a Manhua comic called Feng Shen Ji about a bunch of very evil gods.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442936/#Comment_442936" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-16T13:30:29+00:00" title="February 16, 2015  1:30PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the concept of a Neo-Confucius, it suits this sort of history-in-space space opera. A nice flavourful detail. I'm less certain about depicting such a philosophical figure as a consummate manipulator; rather, surely they'd believe in some sort of divine order that everone, themselves included, is obligated to obey by cause of human nature.<br/><br/>And yes, the concept is not of a supernatural power, but rather of an understanding of the psychological forces in play in human society. Sort of like Hari Sheldon's Foundation and its psychohistorical insights, except applied on a more personal, immediate level.<br/><br/>Transcendental Vigour is a nice name for the notion of using personal presence as a trigger for social change.

And of course you'd also have rogues who utilize their elevated insight for petty gain and personal aggrandizement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442937/#Comment_442937" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-16T14:14:46+00:00" title="February 16, 2015  2:14PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2015 2:38PM by Potemkin.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the sound of Neo-Confucian Dogs in the Cosmic Vineyard, "realigning" society with courtly manners and kung-fu as they travel the 10,000 stars.

However heroes are not defined by occupation (in LotW you are either a Warrior, Doctor, Priest, Scholar or Courtier - though these can cross oever since those choices determine your initial magical powers: your Secret Arts). Instead it will be more like Qin Warring States wherein characters can choose from a shoppling list of abilities. So for instance you can have a character with some Taoist spells and an ability to use a sword (like the crazy old Taoist in Chinese Ghost Story). How that will work is that heroes will have a Chi score and the Chi cost of their abilities cannot combine to beat that score. As they progress so too will their Chi. <br/><br/>2. Again I make the distinction between Japanese and Chinese culture. This is not intended to be a mish mash of things Asian. It is very specifically oriented around wuxia/chinese folklore. This is why I mention Legends of the Wulin because it captures that culture, even if it's not 100% historically accurate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442955/#Comment_442955" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-17T10:05:47+00:00" title="February 17, 2015 10:05AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There's a whole bunch of options.

While such archetypes are evocative and interesting, they are ultimately limiting and represent too much of a designer wanting to impose a setting rather than present one. Those limits are worth removing even if it means losing some other ideas as well.
