These secretive manipulators don't go out into the world for one reason or another (they might have severe allergies to the outside world, they might operative behind a veil of secrecy, they might be a disembodied AI).<br/><br/>Instead the players affect the world around them by calling on pawns, followers, mercenaries, cultists, etc. Each player controls a bunch of these, and should have a team who are capable of succeeding in a variety of cyberpunky tasks.<br/><br/>A pawn is defined by two custom designed cards...placed side by side to form a complete character template. The card on the left defines the culture to which they belong (who they grew up with, their genetic heritage, etc); the card on the right determines their occupation, trade or training.<br/><br/>Beyond this, a range of other cards provide quirks to personalise the templates and learn a bit more about these pawns as they become more significant in the context of the developing story. But the core of each character is the pair of cards.<br/><br/>What suggestions would people have for some appropriately cyberpunk cultures and some appropriately cyberpunk occupations? I have some ideas, but I'm throwing the question out there in case someone else has a great concept that makes me go..."YEAH! AWESOME. I've gotta include THAT!!"                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261641/#Comment_261641" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T09:36:06+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  9:36AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds like a pretty cool game. I doubt I'll suggest many things you hadn't thought about, but here goes...<br/><br/>Okay, so I started writing a list of cool occupations, and they weren't cyberpunk stereotypes; just cool occupations. Like I had "administrative assistant" and "sound engineer" in there. My question is, do your cards have to be cyberpunk stereotypes? Cuz damn I want to play an administrative assistant caught up in a cyberpunk plot now.<br/><br/><b>Occupation stereotypes</b><br/>(rebels): musician, reporter, hacker, nomad, "blank," pirate radio operator.<br/>(paramilitary): war veteran, SWAT, police officer, intelligence officer, soldier, private detective.<br/>(criminals): drug dealer, fixer, fence, hit man, yakuza.<br/>(intelligentsia): scientist, programmer, engineer, technician.<br/>(power players): corporate executive, politician, mob boss.<br/><br/><b>Culture stereotypes</b><br/>(organized crime): Yakuza, Mafia, Tong <br/>(geeks): Hackers, Gamers<br/>(media): Hollywood, Music Industry<br/>(upbringing): Japanese, Euro, Arcology, Sovereign Gated Community, Ghetto/Hood, Nomadic, Bridge City                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261723/#Comment_261723" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T14:42:48+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  2:42PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great idea.<br/><br/>A lot of cyberpunk fiction has that noir feel about it...characters caught up in events well and truly outside their control and comfort zone. <br/><br/>I'd certainly love the idea of introducing a couple of Regular Joe concepts into the game, just to see how they'd react to the situations around them.<br/><br/>When you watch something like Burn Notice (which probably would have been considered fairly cyberpunk 20 years ago with all it's gadgetry, fashion and little guy against the government attitude), the spies and assassins often need the help of admin assistants to get things done. These concepts could certainly bring new and interesting traits to the table.<br/><br/>Thanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
