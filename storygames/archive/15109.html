Definition<br/>2. Description<br/>3. Mechanic<br/>4. Example<br/>5. Arrangement<br/><br/>What do I mean by these items?<br/><br/><b>Definition</b> is the glossary-like and concise explanation of what your thing is. "What is THAC0?" "THAC0 is [definition]."<br/><b>Description</b> further breaks down and elaborates the definition, making it more flavorful or more precise. "Here's how to tell if your Location, for Fiasco, is a good one \u2026"<br/><b>Mechanic</b> is how the thing interacts with the game's moving parts. "When you fail a roll, once per session you may use a call-on trait \u2026"<br/><b>Example</b> is an example of what this thing would look like in-game. "Jade tells the Storyteller that her vampire is hunting for food. The Storyteller says \u2026"<br/><b>Arrangement</b> is what you have to do with the game materials in front of you\u2014the pens and paper and stuff\u2014to make this thing go. "Draw your Faceless's mask here. This is not optional."<br/><br/>I am trying to determine the most effective order in which to present these elements to a reader. I understand that the categories blend into one another and that they aren't perfectly all-encompassing, but that's where I'd like to call on you guys to suggest alternatives and such\u2014I really just came up with them in five minutes, they're not advanced Forge vocab or anything. Should they just be listed in some order underneath a heading? Should certain parts be cordoned off into their own section of the book? How should one restate things in summary sections, or for familiar readers, or whatever? Under what circumstances does the answer change?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343508/#Comment_343508" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-21T13:42:52+00:00" title="September 21, 2011  1:42PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2011 1:43PM by jenskot.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My personal preference:<br/><br/>Tell me in the order I need to play.<br/><br/>Assume play starts before the book is fully read.

The freedom to take our time, and to write as many words as we like to be as thorough as possible can unravel it all.<br/><br/>So what do you do?<br/><br/>Video / Audio record yourself explaining the game to real people. Ask them to stop you if they get lost and ask questions. Review the recording.

Define definitions first when they are used and secondly in the back of the book in a glossary type reference. In general, redundancy is a good thing. Don't overwhelm me with anything I don't need to know till I need to actually use it. But at the same time make it easy for me to reference anything I forget. These are 2 separate goals which likely need 2 separate solutions. Don't combine them. Which is why redundancy is useful. Also, don't forward reference. Don't say, turn to page XX to know what I'm talking about right now. Just tell me. Even if you will tell me again later. Redundancy is good! <br/><br/>In general, I would like "Mechanics" and "Arrangement" to be explained at the same time. Also, I really like when a game shows me a picture of my character sheet and points to the relevant parts when discussing what I should write where. <br/><br/>Examples are great and dangerous! <br/><br/>In general many of us need to be told something 3-7+ times before it really sinks in. Preferably told in as many different ways as possible since we learn differently. Examples are a great way to do this.<br/><br/>Also include counter examples. Include examples that tell us what not to do. I like the ratio of 2 examples of how to do something and 1 example of how not to do something. For your 2 how to examples, make one an obvious example and the second an extreme, something people might never thought possible example. <br/><br/>Don't make your examples into stories. I don't need to know the backstory behind Sarah punching Bob. Just tell me how punching works. <br/><br/>Also, don't tell me that Chris is a player playing Sarah who is a character who is punching Bob who is played by Sandy. That's really convoluted and confusing. <br/><br/>For some reasons it is trendy to be against saying "you" when you means "your character". Of course we know that when we say "you use a magic spell to put the dragon to sleep", that we don't mean you the player but rather your the character. Is it technically incorrect? Yes! But most people know what it means, its simpler, clearer, and faster. We're already juggling too much in our minds when trying to learn new games, don't add more confusion!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu" title="kobutsu"><img alt="kobutsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c22b7a0141698356c899c4f7f1200ed7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kobutsu">kobutsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343519/#Comment_343519" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-21T14:12:26+00:00" title="September 21, 2011  2:12PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>If I have to make a decision, what information do I need to make an educated decision?</blockquote><p>This, especially.</p><p>I will say, though, that explaining something to someone in person is different in some important ways.

I focus on ease of use for the reader. That said, now onto the ideas...<br/><br/><b>Ideas</b><br/><br/>The question I ask when creating a document is, "What will the reader want to see first?"<br/><br/>With my understanding of how you're using your 5 concepts, I would say<br/><br/>1. Give them important definitions first, so that they know what those words mean when they encounter them. The use of the word should follow shortly after the definition.<br/>2. Include descriptions, mechanics, and examples where they fit into the processes or procedures that the reader will be following when playing the game. Your reader is using your RPG book to find out <i>what they can and should do</i>. For this reason, I think it is best to boil all information down to helpful and clear processes and procedures when possible.<br/>3. If the information is not "What To Do", then it's probably "What You Need To Know". Keep this information separate from the processes and procedures, but have it close by in case they go looking for it.<br/><br/>Regarding arrangement, I would treat it like the other concepts and ask: "When will this matter?" Then insert it where the reader will want it.<br/><br/>I would think that you could even have a 2 column sort of layout where the left side is basically reference: Here's what you need to play the game.<br/><br/>Then, in the right column, list out the relevant details. Those details answer the questions that might arise as the reader follows the reference material.<br/><br/>Just make sure that you keep each information type distinguishable and separate from the other information types, and label each thing! (Information types are explained in the structured writing link above.)<br/><br/>I realize that I'm answering some questions that you didn't ask, but when presented with your 5 concepts, this is where my thoughts went.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343537/#Comment_343537" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-21T17:30:19+00:00" title="September 21, 2011  5:30PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me, it often doesn't matter as much in what order things are first introduced. What matters to me is how easy or not easy it is to go back and find those things later.<br/><br/>An example of a bad use of order. The combat maneuvers in the Savage Worlds Explorers Edition. They're alphabetized in one big list. Which sounds like a good idea. But it's not. Organizing them in sensible, thematic chunks with headings (like movement options, shooting options, etc) would make a lot more sense and make it much easier to reference them later.<br/><br/>After the first time I read it through (and very possibly before that) a game book is used like a reference book. So use reference book conventions. Like good headings. An index. Meaningful groupings and orderings. Things like that.<br/><br/>And when you describe a procedure, describe it as completely as possible with as little cross-referencing as possible. Ideally, I should be able to look in that one place for how to do that procedure, follow it, and be done, rather than needing to jump to 3 other places where important stuff I need for the procedure is hidden away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_343546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/composertp" title="composertp"><img alt="composertp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tINibczPBx0/ToT_TX0gjLI/AAAAAAAAB_8/LRyRi1plPkw/s800/docsavage%252520avatar%252520white%25252032x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/composertp">composertp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343546/#Comment_343546" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-21T18:52:20+00:00" title="September 21, 2011  6:52PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very well said, RobMcDiarmid - I completely agree!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343547/#Comment_343547" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-21T18:56:28+00:00" title="September 21, 2011  6:56PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Question pertaining to the commandment of "Thou shalt not forward reference".

Tricks like putting sentences that define a concept in bold or some other consistent formatting can be used to give you more flexibility mixing things together while making later reference be easy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343863/#Comment_343863" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-24T13:22:54+00:00" title="September 24, 2011  1:22PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lula,<br/>\n  You forgot one educational tool, pictures/diagrams.<br/>\n  I put some thought into it and came up with a system I like to use:<br/>\n1) Describe what the game is about<br/>\n2) Glossary<br/>\n3) Describe the setting<br/>\n4) Describe what the characters will be doing<br/>\n5) Describe how the game is played<br/>\n6) Describe how to make a character<br/>\n7) Describe how to run the game<br/>\n8) Resources to build Antagonists, scenes, scenarios, stories and/or adventures<br/>\n9) Appendices that include quick reference materials<br/>\n<br/>\n  In each chapter, I do the following:<br/>\nA) Describe what actions that the characters are doing that this chapter is about<br/>\nB) Glossary of terms used in this chapter<br/>\nC) Description of mechanics used in this chapter<br/>\nD) Diagram of mechanics<br/>\nE) Example of mechanics in use<br/>\n<br/>\n  Hope that helps!<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344575/#Comment_344575" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-30T17:03:50+00:00" title="September 30, 2011  5:03PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like shorthands for context.
