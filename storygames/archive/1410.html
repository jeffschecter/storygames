                    A couple weeks ago, I hosted on FoundryMUSH a discussion about immersion and techniques borrowed from acting with Kate, a trained actress (<a href="http://adam.legendary.org/index.php/Foundry_Log:_Immersion_with_Kate%2C_part_one" rel="nofollow">logs here</a>). It was a cool thing and I decided to do more discussion events with people outside our circle. You can learn more about the <a href="http://adam.legendary.org/index.php/FoundryMUSH" rel="nofollow">Foundry</a> and how to connect and talk and stuff on that page.<br/><br/>This week, I have a 3-6 table-top gamers who have played mostly traditional games but who have also played on MUSHes. They're willing to sit and chat with designers about their good and bad experiences for a couple hours on <b><span style="color: blue;">Thursday, September 21 from 8 PM  - 10 PM EDT</span></b>. <br/><br/><b>Alex</b> started gaming 14 years ago and has played RPGs nearly constantly for the last 9 years. Alex plays D&amp;D and White Wolf games almost exclusively but has played in some LARPs, role-played on MUSHes, and played various console and PC RPGs.<br/><br/><b>Melissa</b> started on the table-top with Star Wars (WEG) and GURPS 12 years ago and started on MUSHes 10 years ago. She plays or GMs twice weekly and plays online (MUSH) a few hours a day. She's also played Rifts, Star Trek, TMNT, and various World of Darkness stuff including LARPing. She says of her single Rifts experience, "The Gm made it so complicated it took me 5 hours to make my character and we never got to play. Never went back." Melissa and her husband have been toying at designing their own game rules for five years.<br/><br/><b>Rachael</b> claims she's been role-playing all her life. "When I was 7, my best friend and I created Civil War heroines and had a long-running story we acted out with them. My first formal RP experience was at age 16, when I joined a Vampire LARP. That was 10 years ago." In the last 6-12 months, she's played in three long-term tabletop campaigns, two large-scale LARPs, and countless single-session games with many different systems (including a most twisted game of My Life with Master with me and others at GenCon this year). She's played a lot of D&amp;D 2nd and 3rd Edition, D20 Modern, GURPS, Shadowrun, Call of Cthulhu, TOON, Deadlands, the entire White Wolf gamut, Star Wars, My Life With Master, Primitive, and various unpublished systems. Rachael has played in a few LARPs and she role-plays on MUSHes. Of rules she says, "My favorite RP experiences were actually systems with minimal rules, or games in which we used D&amp;D but played fast &amp; loose with the rules. It's been my experience that the less rules there are, the more RP there tends to be."<br/><br/>More bios as they're submitted to me.                </div>

I'll just have to add that the discussion with Kate was, according to the log, an excellent one, as she puts a lot of the immersive stuff and techniques to concrete words.                        </div>

<b>Sam</b> has been gaming for about 18 years. Recently, he games only occasionally, sometimes tabletop gaming online with some friends. He GMs as much as he plays and says he prefers to GM "story-driven sessions" and doesn't mind "hand holding my characters through a story...  In recent years, I've always encouraged my players to make characters with goals and aspirations so they can set the pace of their own games. And I just provide the challenges that would be in the way. My most infamous example of this was a Champions game I ran where the players ended up deciding that they wanted to take over the world to save mankind from themselves, from their the emphasis shifted to managing their new world order and we had a lot of fun." Sam lists Shadowrun and Pendragon as his favorite systems of all time but mentions Mutants &amp; Masterminds and Exalted as his current favorites. His worst gaming experience was a Talislanta game that derailed very badly. He says the game "completely spiraled out of control" and that, while he doesn't really like the system, the setting is his favorite of all time. His best gaming experience is his Pendragon adaptation of Castle Ravenloft. Sam lists playtesting Verge as "a close 2nd" (woot!).                        </div>

                            Okay, probably the last bump. In just 2.5 hours from now, at 8 PM EDT tonight (Thursday), you should log into <a href="http://adam.legendary.org/index.php/FoundryMUSH" rel="nofollow">FoundryMUSH</a> and chat with some traditional gamers who are not game designers. Some are typical, others are pretty hardcore. Two of them have played indie games and that's like one or two sessions each, ever.                        </div>

<b>H</b> has been a gamer for ten years. He started with Shadowrun, moved to White Wolf games and Deadlands, and most recently played 7th Sea. He's GMed and played. H has done LARP and MUSH, too. His favorite system is Deadlands. H hasn't designed his own game but he writes house rules by frankensteining bits and doesn't see the point of writing a new game himself. "I think most games have aspects that rock and other aspects that suck and that a good game can be made dreadful by an awful GM and a dreadful system can be saved by a fantastic GM," he says.<br/><br/><b>Cypress</b> has been gaming for 12 years, mostly as a player. She's played D&amp;D, Mage, Vampire: TM, Call of Kathulu, Rifts, as well as role-played on several MUSHes. She plays and GMs Big Eyes, Small Mouth on OpenRPG and has played in Vampire LARPs a couple times.<br/><br/>The event is starting now. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> </div>
