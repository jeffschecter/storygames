This for the most part only happens at Cons, but occasionally I can see a situation with a home game. <br/><br/>For example, someone signs up for my Monsterhearts game at a convention, but says they are uncomfortable with sex in their RPGs. The sex, sexuality, and identity confusion is a major point in that game and without it, you really are not coming at the game from an authentic angle.<br/><br/>So when players and core game concepts come to blows, what do you do?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439999/#Comment_439999" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-06T17:22:53+00:00" title="November  6, 2014  5:22PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I play something else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doctorduckbutter" title="Doctorduckbutter"><img alt="Doctorduckbutter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doctorduckbutter">Doctorduckbutter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440000/#Comment_440000" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-06T17:34:55+00:00" title="November  6, 2014  5:34PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I am mostly speaking on behalf of Con Games, where maybe 5 of your 6 players wanted to play game X, and the last person might have signed on just to have something to play.

I've also seen games made dull and less than entertaining by people who chose to stay in, but were unable to engage with the topic. If you've ever excused yourself from a con game you didn't feel well about, then you deserve a thank you IMHO \u2014 maybe you found something else to do, maybe you didn't, but you were a grownup about it and allowed other people to have a good time as planned.<br/><br/>Not that the above happens often, in my experience. Maybe with the sort of conventions I go to, everybody likes to read what the games are about before signing up? Might be because I favor very small conventions (small by non-Italian standards, at least).<br/><br/>There's the potential for communication failure, though! You can't always anticipate which topics can be touchy to other people. When I write a summary or intro blurb for a convention game, I try to focus on what the game is really about, but sometimes a detail I didn't think it necessary to put forward turns out to be a serious issue trigger for a player.<br/>This never happened to me with a strictly The Forge-y tabletop RPG (in which case, anything not worth putting forward as "what the game is about" can usually be customized to players' tastes on the fly) but it's a very real risk with any games employing secret information, such as freeform scenarios which include detailed character backgrounds/write ups.<br/><br/>For example, I co-wrote a game which a friend was supposed to run at a convention recently. I pitched it as being about summer loves as viewed from different times in one's life, and I maintain that's what it's about. But the game includes 2-3 pages of "secret" background per character (a nod to the Italian tradition of chamber larps). It was reported to me that, after picking up their characters, one player found that one defining event in her chosen character's biography was trigger-y to her, for personal reasons. In retrospect, I could maybe have seen that coming, and maybe add a list of trigger warnings to the game blurb (however slightly spoiler-y), but at the time of writing I didn't.<br/>Due to the inflexible design of both the game (requiring exactly 4 players plus a facilitator) and the convention itself (where everybody was already signed up for a similarly inflexibly-designed game), they had to cancel the game. I believe they absolutely did the right thing, under all those constraints. I'm just a little sorry that the scenario still lies unplaytested, but there will be other opportunities.<br/><br/>All of the above strictly concerns convention games, of course. When hosting a game at my place, we would of course switch to a different game should some issue come up, making sure everybody's needs are being met.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440015/#Comment_440015" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-07T22:19:40+00:00" title="November  7, 2014 10:19PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't game at cons usually, except with groups I already know, so I have no direct experience.
