Get enough people to believe you're a god and you'll have the power of a god. Also the alignment system of D&amp;D I thought worked incredibly well in Planescape, because alignment actually had an in-game effect with the various aligned planes. In one adventure a group actually introduces chaos into a lawful aligned plane and causes part of the plane to slip into another plane. How cool is that?<br/><br/>You had cities rumored to have been built in the body of a dead god, and if too many people believed that was true, the god would come back to live. Again, how frickin cool is that?<br/><br/>Any story-game version of Planescape would have to work with beliefs and alignments. To me that was the big draw of the setting.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod" title="Jarrod"><img alt="Jarrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarrod">Jarrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130595/#Comment_130595" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T13:14:28+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  1:14PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My Life With The Lady of Pain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130596/#Comment_130596" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T13:22:34+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  1:22PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://judd-sonofbert.livejournal.com/153004.html" rel="nofollow">Planescape via TSoY</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130600/#Comment_130600" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T13:30:40+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  1:30PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was a big Planescape fan back in the day.

The beliefs the players come up with should point to What the Game Is About. If you're interested in using a lot of the existing PS source material, you might find that the beliefs of the players fit with in the myriad Factions and Sects, but otherwise you could certainly just toss the lot and make up your own stuff with just a basic skeleton of Sigil.<br/><br/>There's stories about the workings of the city itself. Personal stories about high-minded idealism confronting real world problems. The transformative power of belief. Crazy-ass power-brokering between supernatural forces.<br/><br/>There's something very story-gaming about a D&amp;D setting that was essentially "Battle Philosophers"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130612/#Comment_130612" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-26T14:04:29+00:00" title="February 26, 2008  2:04PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After attempting to play Planescape TSoY, I found that some of the factions are kind of flat.<br/><br/>If I were to do it again, I might go about it with a kind of faction burner, with players creating factions by answering a few questions about what the faction is saying about reality, how it wants things to change, how its followers bring about that change and what mundane tasks and responsibilities do they see to in Sigil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130784/#Comment_130784" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T06:38:59+00:00" title="February 27, 2008  6:38AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Planescape is the ultimate Wicked Age setting - incredibly far-flung elements become immediately relevant to each other's situations because their best interests are in conflict.  <br/><br/>So you do an oracle for far-flung elements, tease characters out, point best interests at each other, and have lots of opportunity to see different sides of the setting because you have a nice random Oracle keeping you from siloing.
