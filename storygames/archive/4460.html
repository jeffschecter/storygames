I've got character sheets, Fate cards, rule summary quick sheets...<br/><br/>But I'm looking at my prep -- a dozen Bangs/Situations on the way up to the castle and I'm thinking, "Um, is that all I've got?  Is that all I <i>can</i> do?"<br/><br/>I mean, I don't know the characters, I don't know their Fates, I don't know who or what the Players will introduce...!<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong.  This sort of challenge of weaving story elements together is a dream come true for me.  But it seems like this is even crazier than charging into a PtA session...  I know the Players will be lifting a lot of the load -- but how much?  How much do I need in <i>my</i> kit-bag?<br/><br/>So those who have played, knowing that I'll be breaking out the rules for the other Players, making characters and playing for a couple of hours tonight, what sort of preparation have <i>you</i> done?  What would you suggest I have ready?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots" title="dyjoots"><img alt="dyjoots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots">dyjoots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100863/#Comment_100863" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T13:53:36+00:00" title="October  3, 2007  1:53PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Really, I just emphasized how much the players had control over the introduction of plot and character elements... I mean, that's half the game right there; you get to reveal your secret dark fate over time, and you are pretty free with what you get to make up (including adding things to other characters). If the players hook into that, they should be introducing all kinds of things.<br/><br/>It's not going to run the game for you, but it will mean that you have less prep. One other thing I did prep-wise was to make situations targeted at each of the dark fates, so that the players who wanted to could grab them and take advantage. Or not, if they didn't dig it. I just gave them openings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100885/#Comment_100885" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T14:36:55+00:00" title="October  3, 2007  2:36PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're good to go.

After those go off, the players start doing stuff and if they're into it, any new bangs I use later on I build on the spot based on what's happening with the characters in-game.<br/><br/>Playing and running TMW is less about prepping your story elements (bangs) ahead of time, and more about going with the flow once those few initial bangs set things off. Once the characters start interacting with each other, your role is to simply keep the pressure on them while moving them toward the final confrontation. After the start, bangs you set off on them along the way are built on in-game stuff mostly, though you can still resort to a prepared list if need be.  And don't feel any need to hit all or even half or fewer of the bangs on your list - you should have no qualms about ditching them. About the only thing you can be certain of, as the GM, about the outcome of the game, is it probably won't be anything like what you imagined!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100947/#Comment_100947" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T22:57:27+00:00" title="October  3, 2007 10:57PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Someone run this game at Orccon in February please!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100981/#Comment_100981" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T04:50:57+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  4:50AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            the main idea I got about how to run TMW, from the first (and only) time I ran it, is this:<br/><br/>the players feed you stuff about their Fates (like "from our vantage point up on the cliff, we see a group of warriors walking in the forest below")<br/><br/>then you write that down (or just make sure you don't forget it)<br/><br/>then, at some point, you have that group of warriors show up, and challenge the PCs' trust in one another somehow (like "they ask so-and-so to follow them")<br/><br/>thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101146/#Comment_101146" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-04T16:04:51+00:00" title="October  4, 2007  4:04PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hoog</cite>the main idea I got about how to run TMW, from the first (and only) time I ran it, is this:<br/><br/>the players feed you stuff about their Fates (like "from our vantage point up on the cliff, we see a group of warriors walking in the forest below")<br/><br/>then you write that down (or just make sure you don't forget it)<br/><br/>then, at some point, you have that group of warriors show up, and challenge the PCs' trust in one another somehow (like "they ask so-and-so to follow them")<br/><br/>thoughts?</blockquote>\nI think that's pretty much it. If it's related to their Dark Fates, they can bring in whatever they want. Oftentimes though, I find some veteran players having difficulty just being able to say ""from our vantage point up on the cliff, we see a group of warriors walking in the forest below" because that's traditionally the GM's job, and some players may feel uneasy with defining and bringing such things into the game, or simply expect the GM to do it. That's why I think it's really important to stress that players can do that, if it seems like they won't or don't know they are encouraged to by the system.<br/><br/>Once people latch onto the idea, boy do they run with it,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
