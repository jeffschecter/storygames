If the weather is nice, some of us will go on a small hike.  If the weather is crappy, then we'll stay in and play speed-rounds of indie games.<br/><br/>2) However, the schedule as-is looked kinda lonely without more events listed.  As we're plugging this thing hard, I didn't want people to think, "Awesome! This sounds like fun!  Wait... there's only 10 games listed? WTF?" . I was going to pre-plan about 3 more events on the Wiki, just for shits and giggles (from Whispering Vault to Savage Worlds), to see who is up for what.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vaxalon</cite>Basically, what Andy and Kevin are saying, is that they don't trust you.</blockquote>\nAnd what the hell is up with this?<br/><br/>To the contrary, I trust that people will come, hang out, meet for the first time (or Meet Again), and leisurely want to do their own thing without having to worry about running from cabin to cabin looking for their table for their next X:00 game. "Sorry, would love to sit here and talk to you, listening to Clinton play the banjo over there, but I <i>really</i> have to make my 4:00 slot."<br/><br/>I am a big fan of organization.  And yet, I just don't see this event being as tightly "fit in boxed slots" as, say, a gaming convention. Maybe it's just me.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61036/#Comment_61036" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T12:00:10+00:00" title="March 14, 2007 12:00PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, <br/><br/>Ditto.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61037/#Comment_61037" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T12:01:22+00:00" title="March 14, 2007 12:01PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            to further elaborate my position, I posted a couple of "I would be interested in this game" edits but without any definite game running deadline i don't want to keep going back to check on things and possibly un-commit to something.

People don't know about the game sign-up (or despise it if they do)<br/>2. The game sign-up doesn't have any one place where the schedule is somewhat formalized. Most games WANT to occur in one spot, and MIGHT occur in several others, making it difficult to make a meaningful choice.<br/>3. Games will continue to be announced. Essentially by signing up early, people are limiting their options.

It's implicit in the wiki but never stated.<br/><br/>The other part of the problem is that in order for the system to work, people have to post games they want to run (in fairly large numbers) and people have to sign up for the games they want to play (also in fairly large numbers).<br/><br/>We did the "Hey, who wants to play 'X'?" thing at Camp Nerdly zero.  From my point of view it was suboptimal.  Games started and stopped according to no real schedule, we wasted a lot of time figuring out what was going to get run, and I got a lot less play than I would have liked.  I don't think the situation will be much better with more people; we'll be scattered all over the camp, with no way to notify them that something new is starting up and do they want to play.<br/><br/>I *really* don't think it's a good way to organize the games.<br/><br/>Let's say that I want to run my Amber playtest.  It's second on lots of people's lists.  they really want to play.  I pick a timeslot I think would be good for it... say, saturday afternoon.  It just so happens that the games that are FIRST on everyone's lists ALSO end up scheduled for saturday afternoon.  Guess what?  Noone comes to my game.<br/><br/>How do I feel?  Betrayed.  I had all these people telling me they wanted to play, and it got ignored.<br/><br/>How do players make out?  They get one out of the top two games on their list, when they could have had both, if anyone had thought to reschedule the Amber game.<br/><br/>So yah... I've got some personal feelings bound up in this, and it came out in my post.  Maybe that was a mistake, but that's how I feel.<br/><br/>How about this as a compromise: Reserve one building for pick-up play.  The people who want to use the organization of the wiki can use it, and the people who don't can go to the pick-up play building or scavenge slots in the organized games when they get there.  People who announce their games are more likely to get players, and people who sign up for those games are more likely to get slots.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61054/#Comment_61054" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-14T12:42:37+00:00" title="March 14, 2007 12:42PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the poke, e.

It helps GMs and players plan out their days.  I for one would like some time to wonder in the woods and do some camp-like stuff.  But if that game of "Chimpmunk Commandos: SG Style" that I had been waiting for all year happened to get together while I was woodsing it I would be annoyed.  <br/><br/>2.  Similarly, it helps me gauge what people want to play. I, as a GM, know what to prep.  I am working on Artesia, a TSOY game, and two BE games.  If it turns out that no one is actually interested in my MezoMecca game then that's one more thing I do not have to bring.  And lets, face it. I'll probably get another 5 mph outta my car by not packing the Burning Empires book.<br/><br/>3.  It's a wiki.  I put my name on stuff now and avoid the rush.  As new items are on the schedule I can make a decision... do I want to play something different?  It's content is mutable.  Sure, it would be rude to step out of a game at the last moment but on the other hand that's why there is a "People that may want to play this if they have time" slot.  <br/><br/>4.  It gives people a head's up on popular GMs/games.  If we see that all the Dogs games are full then organizers and participants alike can offer a second game, etc.  Looking at Dreamation there were a bunch of games that I saw people bumped off and the only thing that got some folks on was a sign up sheet - otherwise you would have had games like Mu and SotC be first come first serve or "I only want my buddies to play my game."  (Of course that last bit is another conversation entirely).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
