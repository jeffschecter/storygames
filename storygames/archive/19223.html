To make the material more useful to designers out there, I'll phrase it more in form of advice from our experience, instead of plain posting an AP or the whole game rules for anyone to analyze. If you strongly disagree with our experience based on the different games cited below, feel free to object and reccomend us other ways of handling their mechanics/procedures/options, and I'll explain more about why we play it in such way insted or if we actually never thought of it. Ok, here we go:<br/><br/><b><i>Too many interesting options doesn't make an interesting game</i></b><br/>I gave players most of Tenra Bansho character creation options, along with all Anima races and a couple of Anima Classes. I reformulated most of them to make them unique/more interesting/give players different options. Yet, a lot of that work went wasted since the most interesting characters were the simplest ones and having a ton of options only means players will either take hours reading all of them or just ask and go for the simplest option to start playing right away. Players might get more interested if they start with a pre-gen or simple limited options, get familiar with the rules and see all these interesting mechanics in action. Only then they will get to explore the options more deeply and try different combinations. Another possibility is that they'll try to use options they are already familiar with (like, "I play D&amp;D spellcasters, then your game spellcasters should be similar, let me try one") -which only works if effectively, you designed them similar. If not, those players will be out for a world of pain until they learn or get frustrated/bored in the process.<br/><br/>OTOH, there's the GM side. The more options the game has, the more she has to deal with. Of course, it's nice to have a lot of things to choose from to assemble your setting, but the more powerful/versatile/strange options you put there for the players to choose, the more easily is to miss something that could breake the setting in the hands of the player. As incredibly interesting and varied I found the Eclipse Phase setting, for example, I realized I wouldn't be able to GM that setting ever. You don't actually need to use the whole range of options Anima or Tenra gives you, and most of the time the GM will bring a ton of material setting of his own. She will only need proper tools to accomodate whatever they make, or maybe three pages of random tables or other devices to help her create the setting, npcs, adventures, etc. A single page of setting general concepts inspires a GM more than a whole book of details on the geography, demographics and history of your own setting. Replace that with art featuring those and both GMs and players will be far more grateful.<br/><br/>So if you're going or a trad RPG or something similar, put the core clases of your game up front the book, show only the simplest options of customization for them and put the rest you came up with on a supplement or on another chapter of the book.<br/><br/><b><i>You're building a machine to build fiction, not a program to emulate physics</i></b><br/>For this hack I choose to let go of character Abilities/Attributes/whatever, and stick to skills. Instead of HP I gave the characters space for describing 5 wounds and used a mix of aiki/hero points /game currency to spent whenever they also wanted to avoid damage. It's a lot on the player's side, but this is what I wanted to emulate when I went for the anime genre, heroes that could withstand a lot of damage and come out still fighting at peak efficiency and even better.<br/><br/>The thing is that players will remember most fondly from any game are not the endless dice rolling, cheking the rules and mix-maxing, but the most dramatic things performed with these. A critical rolled in a critical situation is best remembered than when it happened in any other moment. And the effect and impact that their actions had in the fiction will be more important for them than if the game mechanics obeyed/reproduced properly the real world physics. So, if using a strenght stat only makes the game more difficult because now it has to be added to several other skills, considerate carrying capacity, limit the use of certain weapons, get modified with racial/class/level adjustments that also affect other secondary stats, etc. and not produce interesting effects in the fiction directly, then it's an obstacle to enjoy the game.<br/><br/>Concentrate on the kind of fiction you would like the players to enjoy and build from there. Don't just trust that X or Y generic system/game will be able to reproduce the kind of fiction you're looking for. Focus on whatever you're changing of those systems and if there's anything blocking it or not pushing it further, drop it. Why list Initiative a stat separate of Dex if both will be the same thing? Why can't Constitution be rolled to resist poisons insted of having a different stat for that? The less stats, the more efficient the system, the quicker the whole game and the easier to learn.<br/><br/><b><i>The simpler is to make things for the game, the more fun the GM will have when doing prep, the less factible she will suffer from burn out.</i></b><br/>The main reason I hacked Anima and Tenra instead of playing them as it is was because I've already burn out before of prepping for those games. When you need to waste at least half an hour to create each npc, considering all their stats and balancing them for the time when PCs might meet them and possibly fight... only to see them die before they get to make their speech is quite frustrating for any GM, and may become the main reason for that GM to start using heavy railroalding/illusionism. The longer it takes you to create something, the more attached you become to it and the harder it is to look at things trough crosshairs.<br/><br/>Right now I only have to decide how many dice the character will throw (only three options there) and list what offensive, defensive options and tactics will use. Add any background needed to tie it to the setting and that's it. I can even improvise interesting NPCs and monsters on the go in mid-play. Of course, the emotional matrix from Tenra was among the first features I hacked from there, and I expanded it into a full deck of options to use (which is quicker than rolling). The result is that an scene isn't now just a lot of numbers, it's also alive with an emotion that as a GM pushes me (in a good/fun way) into describing more and roleplaying more the NPCs.<br/><br/>I also added a lot of procedures and aids to help me come up with interesting stories to tell. Now I can actually relax and leave prep for the last moment before playing, something that I couldn't do for the last ten years. If inspiration hits me before that then it's okay, but if not I don't need to stress about what I'll offer to the players on the next session. This is something I've been craving for the last ten years of my life as a GM.<br/><br/><b><i>Emergent character motivation is nice, except when you don't have time for it</i></b><br/>Besides leting character motivation come up during play, there are simple options like "You're adventurers and you're here for the gold and glory" and "You have know each other for quite a long time". There's also the participationism where players collaborate into trusting in each other's characters as soon as they are introduced in the fiction -even if it happens in the middle of the dungeon where they just lost and loot their last partner. Those are practical but potentially inmersion breaking ones. There are those GMs who give players pre-made backgrounds or ask for players to come up with them and make minor or major corrections to fit them better into their settings. These also work but the former is quite railroaded and the later either gives players too much work or too many chances to break the setting.<br/><br/>I went for a random table of both positive and negative open ended questions, which worked both for creating interesting relationships between PCs and between them and the setting. It worked wonders to start the game with an explosive situation where PCs had a clear motivation and could start thinking on a proper course of action as soon as they are on the first scene. I'm going for a  kind of adversarial game, where the PCs might be at each other throat, but I think this kind of start can be adjusted for a more collaborative game, where players are part of a group.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428352/#Comment_428352" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-17T14:37:47+00:00" title="February 17, 2014  2:37PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2014 7:52AM by WarriorMonk.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i><b>There's a limit on the amount of mechanics that players will use, no matter how cool they are</b></i><br/><br/>Checking your character sheet to find something you can add to your roll counts as one, and often is enough to solve anything. It takes just enough play time to not interrupt the fiction, but rolling more than once each time is already and un-efficient waste of time. I also used a table of criticals that I included in the character sheet (I can't remember the name of the game where I hacked this from, it was otherwise sorta trad except for this feature). Also I put a list of things you can do when you spent an amount of hero points. There were some sorta keys/fate aspects you could invoke once per session to get a bonus to your roll. Then there were the class special abilities that give the character a lot of dirrerent options, each with a different mechanic (the only good thing there is that each player has to learn only one, but the GM has to learn them all. At least they are quite simple) <br/><br/>Equipment doesn't give players a bonus here, so that was one less bonus to keep track of. I also eliminated carrying capacity, replacing it with a limited amount of space in the character sheet to list equipment. this helps to limit the equipment better than calculating another derivate stat and keep an account of all the weights of the objects the PC is carrying. Which let's face it, it has never produced an exciting scene anyway. As I noted before, players also had to manage their resources of game currency and the wounds their character receive, both of temporal and permanent damage.<br/><br/>I think that's it for the mechanics each player used on their turn. And that's friggin' too many, since only about half are usually needed for a session. Definitely, if you can keep the amount of mechanics used to a minimun and reuse the same for different things, do so. About five are more than enough I'd say. And there's a similar amount that playars can use when is not their turn. I added a deck of cards players can draw whenever their characters aren't on the scene, that allow them to control some aspect of the scene and get a reward in game currency for applying it in a creative way. For example, they can gain control of an NPC, add obstacles to the scene, help or hinder the PCs on the scene in many ways, add special effects, etc. I believe I'd add another mechanic for players out of scene for my next hack, but I'll definitely reduce the ones players can use in their turn. The less time they spent navigating trough choices, the more time they are roleplaying and having fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Veav" title="Veav"><img alt="Veav" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/007/n3BMK8VFYEJK8.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Veav">Veav</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428370/#Comment_428370" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-18T06:36:49+00:00" title="February 18, 2014  6:36AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you share your hack?

I'll try posting pictures of all the material I use and maybe compile a PDF with it, but a translation is definitely out of question for now, sorry. PM me if you still want the PDF though.<br/><br/><b><i>You can measure a challenge by the amount of rolls needed to overcome it</i></b><br/>This one is new, I was thinking on how sometimes you build a big boss and max his stats to give PCs a decent final battle, only to see how players solve everything with an anticlimatic action before the battle and/or a couple of lucky rolls. And then you either have to improvise, railroad or postpone the final fight. Or that day that you set up a simple encounter with three kobolds and without taking it too far, party makes some mistakes, rolls favor the kobolds and suddenly your heroes got TPKed on an encounter pretty much below their current level. It makes you feel like Challenge Raiting is there for nothing.<br/><br/>It's okay if you really want that randomness in your campaign or if players come up with a really good idea to defeat the boss without fighting -I actually like that too-, but why should that also determine the amount of playtime and effort required from the players? So I went for measuring challenges by the amount of rolls needed to overcome them. Criticals may reduce the rolls needed by two instead of one, but not end the challenge prematurely. Also, the challenge can change into something else in the middle if it seems appropiate, but it doesn't have to automatically end.<br/><br/>Let's go back to the boss fight example: Assign 10 successful rolls to defeat a dragon. Ranger scores a critical to the head of the dragon, but instead of confirming it and straight slay the dragon, you can say that the dragon's agonizing roar makes the whole cave crumble, while it uses his breath attack one more time. The flames melt part of the dragon's treasure so now the challenge is to avoid the flames, the river of molten gold and the falling rocks and stalactites. Perhaps the floor crumbles down a few steps ahead, etc. So, that still makes 9 successful rolls to get out of there. If players fail, they suffer damage and get delayed, but not neccesarily get trapped or die automatically if they don't make it. Unless you think you can continue the story in an interesting way from there.<br/><br/>What you have in the end is still an exciting hard to overcome ending, even if players got really lucky at defeating the dragon in the first round. Of course, players should be aware of this mechanic from the beggining, even if the actual amount of rolls needed to overcome the scene aren't revealed until they a)obtain some intel on what they are about to face or b)the challenge reveals completely to them. Also, you need to tell players that the scene won't end until they achieve that amount of successful rolls. Having the challenge change when needed is crucial here, otherwise it feels -as you guessed correctly- just like "ok, now we gotta keep rolling until we get ten successfull rolls? boooring!" So challenge can change from figting to social, a puzzle, resource management, etc.<br/><br/>On our last session PCs had to stop a kongohki gone asura. I still had not measured the time it took a party to achieve 20 successful rolls, which went over 4 hours of gameplay. Players didn't get to completely stop the kongohki nor complete the 20 rolls (they got about 15) but until that moment they had fought across 40 kilometers of road, ruins, forests, through a river, uphill trough part of the city and above the city in a pretty epic anime style, using all their tricks and getting pretty wasted, so I considered the job done and gave them the victory. Though I still railroad it a little at the end, the whole chase/battle went so good and the outcome was such a twist that they didn't mind and we all had a wonderful time. I should have changed the final 5 rolls into a social challlenge, but I was so thrilled by how things climbed up and it was so late that I put the fate of the Kongohki in the hands of the players on a single final roll. The spirit inside the machine didn't find peace, but at least they vanquished it and save the day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428404/#Comment_428404" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-19T07:38:42+00:00" title="February 19, 2014  7:38AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><i>You can have as many overpowered special abilities as you want, as long as they aren't infallible</i></b><br/><br/>There shouldn't be something like an instant death ray in a game where dying isn't fun. Exalted-like powers are just too much for me and absolutely not anime-like, the way I see anime at least. But I wanted to include some of the most interesting stuff from Anima and Tenra, along with a couple ideas of my own. Yet, how to avoid all the potential loopholes without playtasting and adding rulings to the rules until the whole system is safe? I went by the principle above and worked quite well. Yes, you can have your death-ray spell, except that it's a ray, it has to hit your opponent, it isn't magically auto-locked on your target and your opponent may still draw his sword and strike you before you get to cast it. It may even just barely touch your opponent and do normal damage instead of outkilling it inmediatly. And of course, your opponent may have a vorpal sword, or just a plain rusty one and a superhuman skill to wield it, so you both are in for the fight of your lives.<br/><br/>Wait, doesn't that defeat the purpose of a death ray a bit? Oh totally, in the sense that what you wanted was to get overwhelming ranged advantage against your opponents for free or just because you gained enough xp to level up. But what you have now is actual color for your character, another weapon to be used under different circumstances and not something potentially setting breaker. What, the rogue is complaining that it's still overkill? Well, the actual mechanic makes the death ray spell just as lethal as a well placed sneak attack, or even the attack of an incredibly lucky peasant, surprising an adventurer with a really big rock thrown from high above. <br/><br/>What I mean by this design philosophy is that every single way to kill another being is equally lethal in the end, even when some are more messy than others. So, what's the point of assigning less damage to a weapon above another, when the real difference is the circumstances in which weapon is used? And how efficient is a game when you have to add a ton of rules to make exceptions to the damage limit, only to see players exploit the loopholes in those exceptions like there's no tomorrow? The most basic mechanic of every trad game actually covers this in the most efficient way: roll the dice, if you beat your opponent's roll, you win. The result of the roll creates the consequences on the fiction, but it can also create part of the cause. Your dagger killed the heavy armored soldier because it went through the neck plates. No longer a 1d4 dagger damage has to be completely useless against a DR 5. We're creating epic fiction and here, chances of killing a dragon with a dagger are not zero, as long as the character wielding it isn't a nobody. And it isn't, they are PCs and they deserve a chance as much as they deserve an epic story.<br/><br/>As a result, the game barely needs rules to limit items nor special abilities, except in the way the latter are activated/performed to make them interesting. Items are tools to get things done and don't add bonuses at all. This gives everything the same usefullness -Balance and atmosphere achieved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428447/#Comment_428447" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-20T06:44:58+00:00" title="February 20, 2014  6:44AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2014 6:55AM by WarriorMonk.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><i>Balancing powerful PCs with simple ones is actually possible</i></b><br/><br/>I'm using the karma point buy from Tenra in combination with the game currency (luck points). The more powerful your character is, the more karma it has, as in Tenra. But then in this hack you substract the total karma used to create your character from 108. The result is the amount of luck points your character starts the game with, and also the top limit it can reach. So, powerful characters with lot of options will have less luck points, simple characters with less options will have more of them. And since luck points can be used to avoid damage at some minor cost (being cornered, get an item damaged yet still functional for the moment, etc) less powerful characters are effectively luckier than powerful ones and can survive a lot of damage for a longer time.<br/><br/>Looks too umbalancing and makes powerful characters non-sensical? Yes, I can't say it's a good solution, but I'd say it's a good start, since so far our campaign has become quite interesting because the system mechanics are so unimportant to enjoy the game now that the fiction actually takes precedence and everything that players do improves the fiction. Now we're all less worried about breaking the game and care more about building the fiction. Now there isn't anything relevant in "leveling up" (there's no actual mechanic to level up in the game, but you can spend more karma to gain more abilities/equipment at the cost of reducing your luck points total), so it has become a matter of supporting a narrative growth/decline for the characters. It's refreshingly different, since it's not a game that rewards killing stuff or questing with mechanical means, so now we all play just to see what happens.<br/><br/>I'd reccomend this mechanic (perhaps with a heavy tweak to fix it, it hasn't broken on our table yet but if forced I'm certain it will breake at some point) only if you want to make a game that supports short campaings. Or maybe a long one with a generational saga, where after a few sessions your character's descendants/disciples become the heroes while your older characters die or retire becoming NPCs.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428455/#Comment_428455" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-20T07:31:47+00:00" title="February 20, 2014  7:31AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2014 7:39AM by WarriorMonk.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is the character sheet of the samurai of our party<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/IMG_20140220_075751_zps1f66995c.jpg"/><br/><br/>Top left box are the usual character data including age, which I made Karma-dependant. The more powerful, the older you are. This also influences the amount of Backgrounds you get, but in practice this last part didn't worked too well. Having this determine the character's age was a nice detail anyway.<br/><br/>Top right is the health, just 5 spaces, same for every character. There goes the wound description, which can be either temporal (bruises, poisoned, etc) or permanent (scar, missing eye or limb, etc) Players get to choose if it's temporal or permanent, since they get either 1 luck point for a temporal wound or 5 for a permanent one. In practice this hasn't seen too much use, since the most extenuating battle we've had so far only reached to the point where a few players wasted all their luck points and only one had to take temporal damage while another took poison as temporal too. I'd still had to test this in a more lethal system/situation.<br/><br/>I decided for this system because HP doesn't have any direct narrative implication. As HP goes down, it's assumed the character is wounded but still functional. It takes other conditions like sttagered, stun, etc to see an actual effect on how the battle is played, while penalties to the dice rolls doesn't make players roleplay anything related to the wounds inflicted. So I went for the "luck points" solution that allows PCs go somewhat unscathed and rewards players for actually taking damage.<br/><br/>Next line below those two boxes is the only things that can be considered like ability scores for the game. These aren't related to the character's strenght, dexterity, etc, but to the way the character tends to do things/solve problems. From left to right the first one is "by Instinct", "with Violence", "Paying Attention", "Calmly" and "With Knowledge". Below those are the skills related to each way. Players assign bonuses from +3 to -1 according to the way their characters will use more, which is barely the only bonus they get to their rolls. These were accomodated in that order to also work as a device to determine a sort of initiative order. Yet in the end this last thing has never seen actual use, since action is so frenetic and fluid that who does something first doesn't matter too much. Players just state their intention and all actions related are solved on a single roll, then it's the next player's turn. I just barely take mental note of who has played and who hasn't to give everyone the proper spotlight and that's it, somehow actual initiative order has stopped to matter!<br/><br/>Below general skills goes the special class skills and then the equipment. Last two boxes are the critical hit table and the list of things to spend luck points into. The back of the sheet is just space for Background info, and that's it. We don't even use some of the stuff, so I believe I could actually build a more solid and simple version.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429320/#Comment_429320" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-10T10:25:09+00:00" title="March 10, 2014 10:25AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In yesterday's session we tripped into one of what I consider now, the biggest design flaw of the game. The quickness and variability of combat had kept us distracted enough before to notice this, but now that I think of it, it looks more and more like a serious design issue and an important problem I've got on the way I'm GMing this. I said before that the game is balanced on the player's side, and there's a lot of streamlined stuff and a ton of special abilities that give the setting most of it's anime-like atmosphere. Now all of this has finally come to hit us back an prove wrong a lot of my calculations and previsions.<br/><br/>It started on a player's abuse of a mechanic, the Curse ability of the Necromancer, which now that I double-check, seems to be the only de-buffing ability that affects characters mechanically for whole scenes. It comes out I thought of this to be used more in a social challenge, where the necromancer's player would have to roleplay the curse and use his creativity to deliver the curse under the requirements of the mechanic. But the player used the ability once to de-buff an NPC and then hit him with another draining ability. The resulting combo, while not forbidden by the rules, was imposible to avoid once the first attack had success. I considered this proper good-thinking the first time, but then the player started to abuse the mechanic to bring the NPC down.<br/><br/>Then my GMing problem came to make things worse: I panicked and railroaded. Mea culpa, this ensued, not a heated argument, but yet a discussion that interrupted gameplay, where I rephrased the rule a bit, acknowledged the player some rights about his interpretation and denied others, and finally kept the scene going on, only to finish the whole session with another improvised railroaded scene. PCs defeated the enemy, but had some help from anothe NPC. It wasn't as bad as it sounds, this scene was justified by previous player's choices and everyone had fun. But of course, I feel it wasn't the best of my sessions.<br/><br/>As for the design problems I'm considering now, well, I'm coming to appreciate a bit more of randomness on battles. Right now this mechanic of "beat X amount of successfull rolls to win the scene" is helping us avoid anticlimatic fights... but this is becoming a given, which eliminates a good percentage of the tension. So, this quest of mine for playing time optimization and balance has resulted in eliminating other tension sources I hadn't considered.<br/><br/>Well, I can't call this game a complete failure, It actually does which I intended at the beggining. And it has helped me to see other sources of fun in a different light. I think I'll wrap up this campaign as quickly as I can and start working on a game with a completely different philosophy, perhaps something that helps me up to avoid my railroading issues at all. Having this game give me more control of the pace has actually made worse those issues, instead of giving the players a better game experience. Lesson learned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430086/#Comment_430086" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-27T08:40:29+00:00" title="March 27, 2014  8:40AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The last session, while a bit short, was one of the best ones I've had. Trying to avoid the railroad issue of the previous post, I tried not preparing at all for this one. It worked as a charm. Of course, I built on previous players actions/reactions and used some stuff I hadn't the chance to introduce, but mostly it was small remarks and additional color.<br/><br/>Instead, my premise for this session was "Okey, now that you have seen the setting and face a few things in it, what do you want to do?" And more or less, I applied this both out and inside the fiction, addressing both the players and characters in separate moments. The response was amazing, players staged an interesting scene of social conflict where things flowed into forming a military expedition to the north monster-invaded mystery-foglands. Certainly I was also thinking this would be the main event of the campaign and prepared a bit for it but I'm glad that for once I didn't railroaded the players into this. This was all players initiative.<br/><br/>I'm also quite happy with this additional deck I'm using that allows players to add details and control NPCs on scenes where their characters aren't present. They love to create content in this way, make things difficult for the players present and have healthy fun at each other expenses. I love how this creates so much more interesting scenes than I can work alone when I handle all NPCs, how things go from there into really interesting places and how this tests my flexibility, which actually gives me less problem than I thought, since I'm way happier when a story goes by itself into a better twist than I originally intended.<br/><br/>Not that it gives me exactly less work, but that's where my character generator shines, and when having an IPad full of inspiring drawing of characters and places pays a lot. Some extra random numbers and I had an entire army with afficers available for the players. I actually did this twice, since players didn't wanted to risk their main army and choosed to form a mercenary one instead, bringing in members of other houses they have met before.<br/><br/>For the next session I'm planning to go old school hexacrawl with the PCs leading the army to the north trough the fog. This means I'll have to prepare a random encounter table that includes enviromental hazards. I'll let you know how this goes.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430626/#Comment_430626" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-07T10:49:27+00:00" title="April  7, 2014 10:49AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm having a streak of good sessions so far. I went for an hexacrawl as I wrote, in full OSR fashion as I've seen described around, except I did no prep except for printing a grid and adding general terrain features, the start and the destination point. PCs were leading the army trough the north, following the old road, which made advance a bit harder since most of the enemy monster guerrilla was expecting them there. However, they made the right choice since wandering trough the fog would meant to get lost in no time. I recycled monsters they had fought before and added a couple new. A friend of mine played with us and though he didn't wanted to play a PC before in this game (it's not exactly his thing), I asked him to add a few details and handle some NPCs, which he found so much fun that now we sorta co-GM the game a bit.<br/><br/>I knew my old deck wouldn't do so good for improvising the events of the road, so I made a list of possible ocurrences and wrote it down on another deck. I added a list of elements for inspiration (fire, ice, water, rock, etc) and that was enough to frame the scene on every hexagon. I also used my old deck when the other one wasn't enough for inspiration and my tablet full of drawings from the web to flesh monsters, NPCs and some places faster. The recurring monsters came from there too.<br/><br/>I found amazing how easy was to connect things that happened eartiler on the sesson with things that came later, so the events didn't felt totally random. E.G. players find the road goes through a forest in flames and they have to choose to either go through and risk some damage or try to find a way around it. They went for this option and later found a monster, which the cards described further as a machine. So I made it a sorta power armor with a flamethrower (I had a picture of this on my tablet) which was burning the whole forest. I had planned this to be an active effort from the enemy to stall the player's army, but then a few miles later in the same forest, they fight a man-eater Ent. I made the connection then: "Now you know why that mech was burning the forest!" And so these power armors ended up being more like the gardeners of the place. The whole north is becoming more like a pacific kingdom of nasty necromancers, which actually fits the setting better.<br/><br/>I had plans for a PC to speak with the King in the North, but I didn't know how or when it was coming to happen. The hexacrawl ended up giving me that opportunity when in mid-session, the power armour of this PC became posessed by a monster and took him further and further away. Since he wasn't on the scene after that, he asked for a card of another deck we're using specially for players whose PC is not on the scene for some reason. The card gave him control of an NPC, so he choosed the drunk ronin that the party had contracted before they left the city. There were actually a bunch of important NPCs with them, but I left the PCs run the show even when higher ranking officers were supposedly present too. I just ruled out the army was big enough that they were on other fronts fighting similar monsters, and came by when they were needed. At some point some everyone was playing with two or more characters like it was natural, doing fine and having fun.<br/><br/>They went as far as a whole day of march and reached the middle point of the map. I know thay will find a whole town invaded by giant spiders (some of the PCs have been there before) but I still have to figure out how this town has changed since their first visit.<br/><br/>Ok, design improvements: the original event list was just 6 items long, now it includes way more and I'm planning to include wheather changes there (I had a mechanic to help with that but in the end I forgot to use it. Including wheather changes in the general list of events seems to be more practical). I've gotta add a list of hidden details for the scenes, so players can roll perception to "discover" things that could be of help or see some tactical use if something happens (like a hollow tree nearby, a small cave, a partially hidden trail etc.) I think that including a few more concepts wouldn't hurt either. With good luck I can possibly fold the monster deck into this one to make a single "outdoors and monsters" deck. I'll keep you informed how it all goes.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431101/#Comment_431101" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-16T08:04:56+00:00" title="April 16, 2014  8:04AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I forgot I had pics of more of the GM material for this game, well here's the GM screen:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/IMG_20140220_074542_zpsdc01cfb0.jpg"/><br/><br/>images came mostly from <a href="http://en.dic.pixiv.net/a/pixiv+Fantasia" rel="nofollow">Pixiv Fantasia</a>, a fantastic yearly event in the Pixiv artist comunnity where they create factions and every artist enlist in one of them and creates characters, places, creatures and vehicles for it. Then they start posting illustrations of them in different situations, creating a whole story. The faction with more likes on their drawings wins the event. <br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/IMG_20140220_074716_zps77dfa6ef.jpg"/><br/><br/>the back contains a few generators to help me with plot design, a resume of all the rules in a couple of pages and a page covered in plastic for sticky notes that contain all my notes for NPCs, PCs and some Mc Guffins.<br/><br/>Design wise, I've realized now that I could do a game with different, more useful generators. This game is totally a power fantasy, but even so, I see I'd have used even less special abilities/powers. The ones I've got are actually quite streamlined and while interesting and quite freeform, they only unbalance the game if you stop thinking of this as a power fantasy, where players can obliterate anything in front of them and all you have to do as a GM is offer a good fight while luck allows you to and drain their resources little by little so the filan fight of the story-arc becomes more epic.<br/><br/>I'd have used a bigger space for the sticky notes actually, I'd definitely do so for my next game. Now I can only stick there the things I know I'll use in the session and even then I often fing myself using table space for some extra notes.<br/><br/>These are the character creation cards:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://i462.photobucket.com/albums/qq344/sigmund_blade/IMG_20140220_074430_zpsbed892bd.jpg"/><br/>These feature the different mechanics for each character, along with their cost and a few lines of background for each class. There's also a couple for special equipment, races and professions, if the players want to add something else to their characters. Multicassing is as easy as picking a couple or three of these and paying points for everything you want. There isn't much advantage for min-maxin here, so you either go one way (creating a less experienced character without too much options, but with tons of sheer luck) or the other (creating a monstruous PC with many specialized skills, but too old to go recklessly into battle)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431468/#Comment_431468" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-22T14:09:07+00:00" title="April 22, 2014  2:09PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, continuing to teach right from wrong, here comes the descriptive damage health box fiasco!<br/><br/>I didn't felt right about HP. It worked, it was useful and in settings with magical healing it was kinda believable that adventurers didn't end up with too many scars or missing limbs. Being a power fantasy, this game could also benefit from that, but I didn't want to use too much HP book-keeping and I wanted to see what wounded the characters. So I tried leaving 5 spaces on the character sheet for players to write down what kind of damage they received. Since luck points allowed characters to avoid damage at all, players only gain wounds when they want (receiving wounds is rewarded with luck points), when the GM deems impossible to use luck points to avoid damage (rarely) or, when they run out of luck points.<br/><br/>It kinda works, but here\xb4s the thing: Usually, players do this book-keeping when it isn\xb4t their turn, and in this hack, your turn comes back quicker than you think. Players keep going at the enemy and receiving damage only when they don't hit. So, everyone either attacks or receives damage and there's no such thing as an enemy turn. Hence, damage book-keeping has seen use but only twice or three times along the eight or more sessions we've been playing. On the last session I noticed a couple of players were just making marks whenever they took damage.<br/><br/>So, either I simplify damage even more to fix this by going back to HP or try an approach that could make it quicker and I've used before: include a human figure on the character sheet, give each body part 2 or 3 damage boxes to check and have players fill those checkboxes instead of writing down the damage. I recall that I used to let players choose, with a successful reflex save, which body part took the damage, when this was aimed to a vital part. Anyway, the idea is that damage leaves a more permanent mark to the PCs bodies, instead of just working as a countdown to death. Also, it seems that letting character regain some luck points by receiving wounds is just an extra mechanic not needed to play, or at least it isn't being used too much, so the less bulk the better.<br/><br/>So, my reccomendation is: if there's enough time between turn for players to take notes in your game, by all means, go with a descriptive damage health mechanic, if you don't like hp. If you've got no prob with HP, go with that instead; it's good enough if battles either take too little or too long, as long as damage isn't a long term deal or something easily cured. If you like it, use a descriptive health mechanic when time between turns are long enough to take notes or there's not much else to do then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
