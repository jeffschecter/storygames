I remember reading about SE in one of Ron E's essays(?) and then couldn't t track it down. Frustration. (this is pre-Dust Devils and many other good games). I would love to check it out.<br/>

                            Hmmm. I remember it, but it was ok.  FATE does the same thing, but cooler even (with crossing off roles and the like for rerolls).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Yeah, I played and ran some SE for a while.  It was generally uninspired but light, the coolest bit being the "Cut scene" option, which, I think didn't see enough support or emphasis.                        </div>

                            As luck would have it, Story Engine got itself way under my skin just prior to GenCon. It called out to me from my game shelf and I read it. And then I totally wanted to run it. Which I did for a bit last Friday at the Embassy Suites.<br/>
<br/>
And now I confess to having mixed feelings about this announced pdf reissue. The game was absolutely ahead of its time when it was released. But at this point I think it needs some fresh playtesting and a few specific fixes:<br/>
<br/>
The rules have Descriptor refreshes happen at the end of each game session. But session length isn't a fixed variable. If I were revising Story Engine I'd almost certainly implement Dying Earth style refreshes for each of the four Aspects as an option for players who find themselves wanting an intra-session refresh. (And maybe in addition to providing new Descriptors, character advancement would provide more refresh options.)<br/>
<br/>
Does a Success Rate calculation apply to opposed rolls? My reading of the rules suggests that it does. And the problem with this is too many inconclusive results. Partial success. Partial failure. Blah blah blah. When a character is trying to convince a city guard to let him in, how do you interpret a partial success? We had too many of these kinds of outcomes where we'd find ourselves roleplaying a bit more dialogue and then rolling again in another attempt to resolve essentially the same conflict. Were I revising Story Engine, I'd want much more conclusive and dramatically satisfying results. (Potentially I might get there by implementing a Sorensen-style "success with a consequence" and "failure with an upside" scale.)<br/>
<br/>
And the broad GM authority over both Hard Rate and bonus dice for circumstantial advantages is too conducive to illusionist style railroading. One of those two factors needs to be locked down somehow. My preference would be for a non-subjective success requirement and a discretionary award of bonus dice, ala The Pool.<br/>

                            I was one of Paul's players in that run, and share his opinion (both the cool, ahead-of-its-time part and the some-problems part).  I solve the problems in entirely different ways in my SNAP design (seperate player-resource from character Traits, ala - now that I think about it - PTA, and resolution is always progress towards a goal that is either acheived or not, for e.g.), but Paul's solutions sound like they'd work and be more true to the existing Story Engine.<br/>
