Young students are familiar with it from their own free-play.\xa0 They know how to use it and how it works.\xa0 With white-metal miniature the wow/strange factor would be too over-whelming.\xa0 Even though spectacle is a desirable aspect of this kind of gaming, too much spectacle in this situation would distract from the actual story-gaming (trust me on this point--I have experience with this part).<br/><br/>2. Lego minifigures are pose-able.\xa0 Their little arms, heads, and legs are movable.\xa0 They can be posed to represent the action the character is taking.\xa0 I think this is an important part of the spectacle, Bob mentioned.\xa0 Turn after turn, you should be creating a moving diorama that informs and is informed by the story as it unfolds.<br/><br/>3. Lego doesn't need to be painted.<br/><br/>4. Lego is pretty tough, nigh unbreakable.<br/><br/>5. Lego people can be "created" in an almost infinite variety.\xa0 If you are familiar with Lego minifigures then you know that the heads, torsos, arms, legs, and hand can all be separated and recombined.\xa0 That means character creation would actually consists of choosing a head, torso, etc. and the accessories and tools/weapons that the character will carry.\xa0\xa0 And this could be an important aspect of the game-play.<br/><br/>I'm looking to design or hack a game that features princess-play for four to eight younger players and a GM-language teacher.\xa0\xa0 I want a story-game rather than a classic RPG with lots of rules and charts.\xa0 Preferably something that would fit on a two-sided page.\xa0 And preferably, the simplest rule system possible because of the age and language level of the players.<br/><br/>I'm also trying to get as much of the rule system on the character sheet as possible, and the character sheet as small as possible.\xa0 If it was the size of a regular playing card, that would be great.\xa0 As a playing aide, I might put all the different items that a character can use and carry on a playing card too.\xa0 Most students are familiar with this kind of card collecting play from games like Magic, The Gathering, and all of its many derivatives.<br/><br/>I'm trying to include as many familiar things in the gaming and keep it as simple as possible because the story-gaming itself has a quite difficult set of skills and techniques for foreign language learners to employ and master (see below).<br/><br/>Rules-wise, I'm inspired by Ghost/Echo and Danger Patrol Pocket Edition, because of their brevity, use of otherkind dice, open-endedness of play.\xa0 But I want to hack them to ground the story-play on the minifigures and the built setting and scenery.\xa0 This is where the problem is for me; this is where I'm stuck; and where I could use your advice and suggestions.<br/><br/>Here's an example of what I mean by grounded on the minifigures.\xa0 <a href="http://www.3rd-imperium.com/LFRP/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.3rd-imperium.com/LFRP/</a>\xa0 This game (by Kristian Miller) is an example of a Lego RPG where the magic system and the combat results are specifically based on the figures themselves.\xa0 The magic system is quite inspired, I think given how it's woven in with the toy use.\xa0 I'd be willing to go ahead and use this system straight out of the box, but the problem for me here is that while the combat results are simple, the combat system that gets you to those results is still too crunchy; and overall the rules aren't story-gamish enough.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>So why do I want to do this?\xa0 Well... I like role-playing\xa0 and story games, myself, and I think the students would find it interesting and engaging as well; and I've recently re-discovered that Lego is kinda cool.\xa0 But really, most importantly, it's about the kind of language use that role-playing and story-games produce, especially story games.\xa0 Students learn language best when they use it in a meaningful way.\xa0 And spontaneously produced dialog and story-telling are the holy grails of EFL teaching.\xa0 Role-playing has a long-standing place in EFL methods and methodology, but it's not really story-gaming, it's more like extremely short, structured larp with little or no costuming or props.\xa0 I want to see if this tried-and-true method can be enhanced with real story-game rules and toys.\xa0 I've read accounts of traditional RPGs used as a language learning tool done well with older students, and I've had some\xa0 learning successes with older students playing Danger Patrol, Pocket Edition; but I haven't had any learning success with my younger students, because story-gaming without the toys seems too abstract (I think) (or perhaps the rules that I've been using have been too complex).\xa0 Anyway, the cognitive load of trying to imagining a scene without realia, and trying to communicate about that scene at the same time in a second language with which one isn't fluent yet is just to great for many younger students.\xa0 I think that adding the toys-miniatures in the mix will help the students bridge that gap--lightening the cognitive load. As for traditional RPGs, charts and tables break the flow of the game, and redirect the kind of language used away from story to focus too much on game mechanics.\xa0 I'm looking at story games for the continuous flow of imaginative language use that they produce.\xa0 <br/><br/>If you can help with my main problem of connecting story-games with toys in an elegant way that's grounded on the toys in a way that is informed by and informs the story, I'd love your advice, comments, suggestions, etc.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453106/#Comment_453106" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-09T18:13:14+00:00" title="May  9, 2016  6:13PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds like a wonderful project!<br/><br/>One question:<br/><br/>Wouldn't your design needs depend a great deal on the skill level of the participants? <br/><br/>For basic vocabulary, you'd be fine with actions like walking around and introducing yourself to another character.<br/><br/>If you've got a serious thing going on a la Ghost/echo, you need some much more developed language skills just to make sense of the game.

At government-funded schools, students start learning English in grade three.  At bilingual schools, like where I am teaching, students start learning English in grade one.  And then at international schools, they can start as early as grade one; and have content classes delivered in English as well.  On top of all that their are also independent language institutes offering lessons after school and on the weekends.  <br/><br/>On average, my bilingual school grade fives and sixes actually have enough (limited) narrative skills.  I'm using an Agents of Shield-esque hack of Danger Patrol, Pocket Edition with a small group of grade sixes.  They are creating a story, and narrating dangers.  I'm having middling success here. Sometimes narrating the results of a roll is difficult for them.  But we're making progress.  This is all scaffolded with pre-teaching of story elements, and teaching of vocabulary that will likely be needed during the session.  I roll up the threats before the session and make visuals, so I have a pretty good idea what might happen.  At least I know the threats they will face and how they are connected.  I do up glossary sheets.  And we use dictionaries, alot.  And it is all supplemented with writing projects where the students write about their character's back-stories, do character drawings, and APs about what a player's hero did during the session, etc.   <br/><br/>I also did a fairy-tale hack of DPPE with this group.  It went well until one of the players got soured on her character, so we switch to the game we're playing now.<br/><br/>These are games without Lego.<br/><br/>I tried a similar one-shot thing with a small group of grade fours from a government school, but it flopped.  I used a Superheroes hack of DPPE; and had Lego and the intersection of a city block built from cardboard boxes and construction paper.  Even though, they had 240 minutes of superhero themed language lessons over a three week period, they just weren't up to the linguistic challenge (I also think the choice of system was a problem for them, even though I walked them through it every time.)  They had fun, but it wasn't too productive as a language learning experience.  The problem was I didn't provide them with enough scaffolding. \n<blockquote>I've got a few language-learning rpg projects in the desk drawer, too, although I haven't looked into the matter in ages. Never thought about making it a miniatures game, though.</blockquote>\nI think that adding the realia (i.e Lego and cards) is the thing that's going to put it over the top.  But I need a simpler game/system and presentation of it--something with a lot of input enhancers (which is part of what the Lego is for).<br/><br/>Open that desk draw of yours and lets see what's inside.\n<blockquote>Thinking of English teaching and miniatures gaming specifically, it occurs to me that miniatures should prove very useful for practicing adpositions and their everyday use in a much more pedagogic manner than usual.

I was wondering about using Lego rather than miniatures with adults.  I'm thinking of running a pirate themed, or Conan the Barbarian style themed game with some parents and their children.  We'll see how it goes.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453233/#Comment_453233" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-12T17:02:46+00:00" title="May 12, 2016  5:02PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm afraid I don't have much grounding in teaching languages, so I'll be little help there.</blockquote>\n<a href="/forums/profile/komradebob">@komradebob</a>, you're the Braunstein messiah; and at least half of the reason I've gotten this far.

It's really the most elegant solution.  It's obviously an Otherkind dice mechanic (thanks Vincent).  I'm interested if anyone can see how these rule could go off-the-rails.  What am I missing?<br/><br/><br/><br/>You're a hero.  Make a Lego minifigure that shows who you are.  Use any parts you want, but don't use more that 14 to start.  You don't have to be human.  Now say what the part is for, e.g. a head for "sword fighting", legs for "running quickly", arms for "swimming quickly", etc.  Each part must have a two (or more) word description that says what function, skill or ability it has.  Each part can have only one of these.  Items with multiple parts can have a function for each part.  Two different parts can have the same function, skill, or ability.<br/><br/>For Example:<br/><br/>MINIFIGURE<br/>Head for casting fire magic<br/>Body for carrying heavy things<br/>Arms for climbing cliffs<br/>Hands for sword fighting<br/>Hips for balancing on high<br/>Legs for sword fighting<br/><br/>ITEMS<br/>magic chrome sword for killing monsters<br/>large shield for protecting me<br/>helmet for protecting my head<br/>shiny long hair for charming people<br/><br/>CHALLENGES, THREATS, FEATS, COMBAT<br/>Any time your hero needs to do something dangerous, tricky, or difficult say the good thing you want to happen and how you will do it, then say two bad things you don't want to happen or two things that could go wrong.  Roll three dice (3d6). Choose which die is for your good thing, and which dice are for your bad things. If you have any parts or items that will help you, roll an extra die.<br/><br/>Good Thing Dice Roll<br/>1-2 The good thing doesn't happen and your chance is gone (things need to change before you can try again).  Say why it didn't happen.<br/>3-4 The good thing sort of happens and you can keep trying.  Say what happened and what prevented you from total success.<br/>5-6 You succeed.  Describe your glorious victory.<br/><br/>Bad Thing Dice Roll<br/>1-2 The bad thing happens.  Describe what happens.<br/>3-4 The bad thing sort of happens and things are still dangerous.  Describe what happens<br/>5-6 The bad thing does not happen.  Describe how you got out of it.<br/><br/><br/>--Your questions and comments would be appreciated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456698/#Comment_456698" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-28T17:04:17+00:00" title="September 28, 2016  5:04PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BTW, these proposed rules are not associated with or endorsed by the Lego Group\xae, etc., just in case there's any confusion.

You could fool around with the scale, instead, if you prefer, or use additional abilities/advantages to add one to a standing die.<br/><br/>A couple of things that might not be to your liking:<br/><br/>* Otherkind dice are tricky to use in conflict situations (where both sides might want to roll). If you plan to have some of this, give it some careful thought first.<br/><br/>* In your writeup, the player rolling does ALL the deciding and narrating. You decide that it's time to roll, you name the good thing you want, you name the bad things you don't want, you roll the dice, you choose where they go, and finally you narrate everything. It's a taste thing, of course, but I would prefer it to be more interactive. Here it's just one player playing by themselves, through the whole process.<br/><br/>* Three categories can be too much for some dangers or goals. The original Otherkind didn't have three categories for dangers, for examples. You can see this in your own text: "The bad thing sort of happens and things are still dangerous." Pretty vague, right? Not a whole lot of clarity there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456733/#Comment_456733" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-29T01:48:28+00:00" title="September 29, 2016  1:48AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Jeff and Paul.
