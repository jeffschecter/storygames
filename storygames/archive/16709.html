Also, we picke the name of the rival town.<br/>3: Created the homeroom map. I forgot to ask questions (my bad).<br/>4: Created families<br/>5: Started playing. Slow at first but quickly picked up speed. Actual playtime was about 3\xbd hours.<br/><br/>Mistakes I made: Forgot to ask questions regarding the homeroom, and didn't get The Fallen (the Chosens arch-enemy) fleshed out. Other than that, it seemed to work pretty well. It wa just supposed to be a one-shot, but my players want MORE!!!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383085/#Comment_383085" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-22T07:14:03+00:00" title="June 22, 2012  7:14AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, the Chosen's arch-enemy needs to be much more prominent, as it's one of the few cases where a skin explicitly gives Strings to an NPC right at the start. The starting queestions are always mondo important, but with the Chosen you've instantly got a major NPC villain to work with, so it's vital to take the time to work out with the player who that villain is and what they represent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383119/#Comment_383119" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-22T14:22:08+00:00" title="June 22, 2012  2:22PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn, Jackson is the toughest chick. She's a good Chosen.<br/><br/>I really like the sequence of events where Jackson climbs into Daniella's bed, Daniella dies in her arms, and then we later find her ghoulish and devouring her parents. There are some Principles in action here, for sure!<br/><br/>When Jackson climbed into Daniella's bed at the hospital, was there any turning on move made?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383144/#Comment_383144" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-22T20:19:49+00:00" title="June 22, 2012  8:19PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jackson's awesome!!!<br/>In the scene where they find Daniella eating her step-father, Daniella has her back turned, so Jackson, being the Chosen, attacks. And misses something fierce (rolled a 3, I think). Actually, I only think Jacksons player, Terese, managed a single succesful roll the entire session. Jackson had soooo many conditions at the end.<br/><br/>As for your question, yes, there was a turning on roll made. Succesfully. We kept the scene tender and loving instead of sexual. It made Daniella's death so much more tragic and touching. I actually had tears in my eyes. A flashback to real life for me, alas.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to seeing what they come up with next. The session actually ended with Daniella moving in with Jackson and her grandmother, eating breakfast, and Daniella looking at grandma, saying "I'm hungry...." Then biting into a sausage.<br/><br/>I'm not really upset that we didn't get the Fallen, Jackson's arch enemy, into play, because I really want Jackson to discover what the Fallen actually is. All she knows is that he/she/it killed her family. Not the reason for it. Me, I'm thinking her father or mother may have been Infernal or part of a cult or something. Would be much more fun to find that her parents were responsible for summoning their own killer.<br/><br/>I think I'll keep Daniella around for a while. First, seeing what mayhem she can cause and discovering what Jackson and Frey will do about her new dietary requirements should be interesting. It'll have to end up a hard choice between killing her or letting her kill.<br/>Second, MC'ing doesn't leave me with much to do. Asking hard questions and creating situations is almost too easy with these players because they happily do most of it themselves, coming up with scenes and such, playing NPC's. I see Daniella as a PC in her own right, played by me, although when a new player joins I'll happily hand her over, should the new player be willing and eager.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
