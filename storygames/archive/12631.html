I wouldn't even know where to get started doing such things, especially given the innovative mechanics the top names bring to the table.  And I couldn't even make it pretty, either, as my <i>graphic design</i> chops are just as lacking.<br/><br/>But sometimes you get caught in a situation where you want, nay, <i>need</i> a game that doesn't exist to become a reality.  That's where I am right now.<br/><br/>I get very little face-to-face play these days, so the games I partake in are usually PBeM or PBP affairs.  It pretty much goes without saying that a lot of systems aren't set up for this kind of thing.  Their mechanics are geared toward fast-paced, or relatively fast-paced, play around the kitchen table or living room.  PBeM/PBPs are more deliberate and work best if resolution is done scene by scene, not action by action.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm kicking around a military-action game that, if I were running it face-to-face, I'd probably use <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=886&amp;it=1" rel="nofollow">Merc</a> for.  But that game has all of the issues discussed above, plus more thanks to its kind of creaky, old-school system.  It's not a good fit for PBeM/PBP play by any stretch of the imagination.<br/><br/>What <i>does</i> it bring to the table?  Simple mechanics that replicate the dangers of war in a way that is realistic, but not bogged down in detail.  Yeah, you can drag out the miniatures to handle <i>Merc</i> combat \u2014 and, admittedly, sometimes you <i>have</i> to in order to get it just right \u2014 but for the most part <i>Merc</i> is stripped down enough to appeal to those of us who don't need a lot of noodling about with weapon types and calibers and all that jazz, while still pretty much satisfying the grognards who want realism <i>\xfcber alles</i>.<br/><br/>Straightforward though <i>Merc</i> may be, it's still not appropriate for the format.  Clearly I need a new game that gives me what <i>Merc</i> has (that touch of realism coupled with comfortable abstraction), but fulfills the story-processing needs of a PBeM/PBP game.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to Tom Sawyer someone into designing this game for me, but I would appreciate some particulars about how to go about solving this problem.  I don't even know where to <i>start</i>, let alone where the process will end.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283677/#Comment_283677" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-30T09:56:35+00:00" title="July 30, 2010  9:56AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It'd be interesting to run a game through warning orders, operation orders, fragmentary orders, etc.  Might not be what you're looking for, but maybe it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283680/#Comment_283680" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-30T10:03:38+00:00" title="July 30, 2010 10:03AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not familiar with the terminology, so I'd have to know more before being able to say one way or the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283692/#Comment_283692" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-30T10:47:10+00:00" title="July 30, 2010 10:47AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>It'd be interesting to run a game through warning orders, operation orders, fragmentary orders, etc.  Might not be what you're looking for, but maybe it is.</blockquote>\nHey! Nice idea! The five-paragraph "op order" is a staple of military operations; I learned to write them as a young ROTC cadet in the eighties.<br/><br/><b>Situation</b>. What's happening on the ground, with attention to <i>enemy situation</i> and <i>friendly situation</i>, viewed through the lens of METT-T (mission, equipment, terrain, troops, and time).<br/><br/><b>Mission</b>. What your unit is supposed to do in support of the larger friendly unit mission.<br/><br/><b>Execution</b>. How your unit is going to do what they're supposed to do. Where they start from, where they go, what they do when they get there, how they know they're done, and so forth.<br/><br/><b>Support</b>. Administrative and logistical details: where you get supplied with gasoline and food and anything else you might need; anything else that counts as support.<br/><br/><b>Command/Signal</b>. Who's in charge, what radio frequencies and call signs they use, and so forth. Issues of deception and recognition come in here as well.<br/><br/>A warning order is basically your higher headquarters coming down and saying, "get ready to write an op order based on the one you're going to get from us; you might want to go out and do some recon, move to a certain location, or otherwise get your shit together" and a fragmentary order (or "FRAGO") is a change to an op order written as a partial op order.<br/><br/>Between the three of them, you have a medium for communication between players who take the role of members of a unit and a GM who takes the role of both enemy and higher headquarters.<br/><br/>The idea has legs, absolutely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
