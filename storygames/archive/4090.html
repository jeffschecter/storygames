Jacobson</cite>As JD says, skills are the functional equivalent of kickers. If I'm the Narrator and one of the PCs has Craft Origami, he's telling me that he wants stories that include origami.</blockquote>\nTo which I re-tell this story as a cautionary tale:<br/><br/>Back in the day, oh, probably 1995 or threabouts I ran a game of Vampire: The Masquerade, as was the fashion at the time.  Even back then I was a fan of the whole Flags thing, although I doubt anyone was calling it that back then.  Basically I was just looking at the player's character sheets and seeing what they'd spent a lot of points on, then making sure they got to use those toys during the game.<br/><br/>So I looked at Jacob's character sheet and noticed that while his character concept was, I think, a techie of some kind he's put four dots in Investigation, three or four in Alertness and a few other related skills.  Ah, thinks me, this chap clearly wants to see lots of investigative aspects to this game: Mysteries, conspiracies, Machiavellian machinations and whatnot.  Which is cool, because that's one of the main themes you find in those oh-so-nicely illustrated books which were the fashion at the time.<br/><br/>I run the campaign, it lasts two terms before it just feels like we've covered everything, the story feels done and the players feel like their characters have either got what they want or never will.  Things draw to a close and, to be honest, it was a fun game.  I enjoyed running it.  In retrospect is was probably mostly illusionism and I didn't really use the rules much or roll dice often but such was the fashion at the time and everyone had fun.  They all told me this at great length.<br/><br/>A couple of years later I ran into Jacob in a pub.  We had a few beers and after a while the conversation turned gaming, roleplaying and, inevitably to my Vampire game and how much he'd enjoyed it.  Then he says (and obviously I'm paraphrasing here because it was something like 12 years ago) "Yeah, I like Vampire and think it's a great game, but I really wish there wasn't as much investigation in it, so much hunting for clues and stuff."<br/><br/>It turns out that every Vampire game he's ever played, before or since mine, has involved lots of Perception + Investigation and Wits + Alertness rolls.  So he'd come to my game already <i>knowing</i> that these were the "primo" things to buy up to decent levels if you wanted your character to be able to achieve anything or be in the least bit effective.  As far as he's concerned, like it or not, your character didn't really have 15 points (or whatever, it's been a long time) to spend on skills, you had 4 or 5 points of Investigation plus 10 or 11 points to spend on other stuff.<br/><br/>I was pretty gobsmacked and explained that the only reason I'd made the game so heavy on the Investigation side was because that looked like what he'd wanted, because that was the way he'd built his character.<br/><br/>You know what he said to me?<br/><br/>"I wish you'd told me that before we started."<br/><br/>You know what?  So do I.<br/><br/>The moral of the story, if such a story can be said to have a moral, is that you can't just assume that what a player writes down on their sheet is exactly what they want to do in a game.  There are so many learned behaviours in the greater roleplaying hobby* that we need to be careful about the assumptions we make about the people we play with and the experiences they might have had previously.  I mean, I love that about a lot of Story/indie/filthy hippy games because they are <i>so fucking explicit</i> about his stuff and frankly it's the most important thing in the hobby.  "We are going to engage in an activity which will be fun" needs to be followed by some agreement on what activities are fun.  That game, and more specifically, that conversation with Jacob afterwards really changed the way I viewed the whole of gaming.  It was a real eye-opener.<br/><br/>At the risk of sounding like a Son of Kryos, it all comes down to "Talk to your fellow gamers about what they want.  Do it before you play, while you play and after you play so that you know for next time.  Don't just assume, because you know what?  You don't have to, you <i>are</i> allowed to ask."<br/><br/>* and I mean that as in "bigger" like "Greater London" not better.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91331/#Comment_91331" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T10:04:10+00:00" title="August 29, 2007 10:04AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right on.<br/><br/>When I wrote this long thing on flags for what I wanted to become the Roleplayers Toolkit (and which was, sadly, lost in a HD crash with simultaneous failure of backup CD), I wrote this whole thing about people picking feats in D&amp;D, for example, for various reasons. One could be because they want to use it. Another could be because they've been whacked with something related to it in the past and they just don't want that to happen anymore. Say, you could take Blindfight because you want to have fights in the dark, OR you could take it because you HATE fighting in the dark, were screwed by a GM who constantly used darkness to mess up your character, and just want to be save. A third possibility is someone taking it because it fit with their character concept, even though they didn't necessarily want to play that out. My solution was a) to talk about it, and/or b) to number the feats according to how much you want to use them in game (i.e., Blindfight [1] says don't bring this up, Blindfight [5] says Hit Me With The Darkness!). That kind of indicative numbering is an easy thing to tack onto any existing game. You can even change it in the course of the adventure and point it out when you do.<br/><br/>In the end, yes: plain old talking about it works best. Little tricks like this are just a reminder or specifier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91337/#Comment_91337" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T10:35:13+00:00" title="August 29, 2007 10:35AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2007 10:39AM by John_Harper.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have had very similar experiences, Rich.<br/><br/>There's another aspect to this skill-flag thing, too. A flag that ties into the reward cycle of the game has lots of power. A flag that doesn't tie in has diminished power (though might still work as a flag).<br/><br/>Justin's example of <b>Craft: Origami</b> in a d20 game is a good example of the latter. Let's say a player took that skill because she really does want Origami to be a non-trivial part of the game. So the GM sets up some stuff to play to that, like a serial killer leaving folded paper notes at the scenes of his crimes. The player is like, "Cool! Origami stuff! I like that." But now system comes in to play. What happens?<br/><br/>The player gets to make Craft: Origami skill checks to identify the style of paper folding or to copy the serial killer's style to taunt him or whatever. Skill + d20 vs. a DC, pass or fail. This is pretty much where it stops. Either the player makes the roll or not (or takes 10/20), succeeds or fails, gets the good info or a lesser clue, etc.<br/><br/>But the game (<i>Passages</i>, in this case) isn't <i>about</i> paper folding. Successful Origami rolls are not the engine of the reward system, so the GM has to be very careful about how this flag is treated. There are many pitfalls, the most famous in gamer lore being the D&amp;D character who wants to be a merchant and tries to spend 90% of each session in town bartering and selling goods. That's a case of a skill-flag that is indulged to the detriment of the game's stated purpose, which often means less fun.<br/><br/>Add to this the fact that, in a traditional game set up, the GM has a lot of authority over how much this skill is relevant to the game. That's a very tricky responsibility that takes skill and practice (and patient players) to get right. Is every session going to include Origami-based elements? How often should it come up? How important is it, relative to the interests of the other players and the goals and actions of their PCs? Who decides these things? The system is of limited help here, unless we are playing dungeon-crawl D&amp;D, in which case everyone knows up front that Craft: Origami is just a fun bit of color and doesn't need to be important at all to our business of monster slaying and treasure seeking.<br/><br/>Contrast all of that to the same flag, presented with a different systemic underpinning: <b>The Key of Folding Paper</b>. Suddenly this bit of player-interest ties directly into the reward system, lasts only as long as it is interesting (without eating up precious game resources, and ultimately rewarding the player for dropping it), and is not dependent on a singular authority for inclusion and relevance. That's the kind of flag I really prefer in my play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

That there are pitfalls with using skill selection as a direction for play does not invalidate the process or diminish its utility. Christian's point about alternate motivations for selection is a good one. I'll note that these sorts of problems can crop up in many story games just as easily as in D&amp;D. What I am a little boggled by is Rich's anecdote. I can't imagine any sort of extended play not revealing the player's disinterest in the topics that kept popping up: eye rolling, sighing, forced by-passing of the obstacle, etc. (Now you have me paranoid about every game I've ever run.)<br/><br/>John, that the skill-flag isn't the best iteration of a flag also doesn't invalidate what relevance it does have. To compare skill selection with keys is invalid precisely because they are different mechanics. After all, TSoY has skills too, and I'd feel remiss if I didn't look to skill selection in that game for an indication of player interest.\n<blockquote>Justin's example of Craft: Origami in a d20 game is a good example of the latter.

Let's not discuss the concept by picking the worst iteration we can think of. It seems like you're looking for more from the skill-flag idea, but I can't figure out what. See my TSoY skills comment above. It doesn't have to tie in to the reward system to be a useful tool in play. I'm not even saying that it is or must be the best way of discerning player areas of interest. But it is useful. Let's look at the Craft Origami example. You've answered your own concern with the player saying "Cool! Origami Stuff! I like that!" It's already proven its worth. As I understand the discussion, we're exploring the dangers of assumed flags, not how they compare to other mechanics.\n<blockquote>Add to this the fact that, in a traditional game set up, the GM has a lot of authority over how much this skill is relevant to the game.

No one said GMing was easy or mechanical.<br/><br/>My summary: Skill selection can effectively used as a flag for player interest. There are pitfalls about using skill selection in this way. But these pitfalls can be avoided by open communication and attention to player response.<br/><br/>Seriously, what's the alternative? Simply ignoring skill selection altogether?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91358/#Comment_91358" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-29T11:52:36+00:00" title="August 29, 2007 11:52AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2007 1:13PM by John_Harper.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, Justin, I guess I gave the impression that I was trying to convince someone of something.

Jacobson</cite>Isn't this true with Agon?</blockquote>As a matter of fact, no. One of the core design principles of Agon is that every ability on the character sheet is relevant to play. This is why you don't get to make up your own abilities in Agon. The game is designed specifically to <i>solve</i> the problems I have had with relevance, authority, and reward issues around skills in my play of other games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D. Jacobson</cite>No one said GMing was easy or mechanical.</blockquote>In the games I prefer to play, GMing is <i>very</i> easy and often deeply rooted in reliable mechanics. Difficult and unreliable GMing is another reason why I don't play some games anymore.<br/><br/>You ask about alternatives at the end, but that question has an assumption in it: "... if I want to keep playing game X." My alternative was to find a different game that treats flags in a way that is most fun for me and avoids pitfalls and then not worry about it anymore. But, yes, if you're playing d20, skill-flags are some of the only flags you get so there aren't many alternatives.<br/><br/>Again, just to be clear: I'm not saying, "Justin, don't use skill-flagging." If it's working for you, why wouldn't you use it? I wouldn't dream of trying to argue someone into playing the way I like to. I'm saying, "I don't prefer that as a flagging technique." I felt like it might be useful to explain why I don't prefer it, and what I prefer instead (Keys, etc.). But that sure ain't evangelism or argument to prove what's best.

I don't have my copy at work with me. (It might please you to learn that Agon is literally on my nightstand as we speak. I read it before I go to bed at night.) Isn't it still incumbent on the GM to take note of the specific abilities of the PCs and respond accordingly? E.g., if a character "maxes out" on oratory, it wouldn't do to have the GM pose only obstacles like golden boars, raging rivers, and ascensions of Mount Olympus.

In other words, if you want to sneak around, take some stealth skills, if you want to be able to blend in with many cultures, take some cultural skills, and so on.  If I see something on your sheet I'm going to assume that it's there because you want to get involved in doing those things, unless you tell me different."<br/><br/>I solve the "everyone needs these skills all the time, so they can't be flags" problem by giving everyone those skills for free and exempting them from any character creation resource allocation decisions.  In other words, if in a Thief: The Dark Project game, everyone needs to be sneaky, I just give everyone the appropriate level of stealth skills and then they pick other things they are interested in.<br/><br/>I never design campaigns fully without having the player characters designed (although, as noted, I need to have some idea of what's going to happen in order to circumscribe Big Generic Systems, if I am using one.)<br/><br/>I don't understand why this is "being careful". I do not understand any other way to use skills, splats or any character design choice. I have never understood any other way to use them, not since Vampire 1ed came out in 1991 and said "pick a concept you think would be cool to play in this game" as the first step and telling me to work out skills/splats based on that decision.<br/><br/>Edit: Interesting note, my wife told me one time that she had made a highly combat capable character in a GURPS game not because she wanted to participate in combat, but because she saw combat in the game I had described as inevitable, and she didn't like combat, so she wanted it to be over as soon as possible!  It made my head spin but it completely helped me design future campaigns (giving an "out" for combat, not feeling bad if she was kicking back reading something while everyone else was enthusedly combat-ting) and I was able to give her some different guidance based on that.  So the "unless you tell me otherwise" bit above is not just filler, sometimes the players really do have other intentions than "I want to roll this skill" when they take it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_91386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Jacobson</cite>What I am a little boggled by is Rich's anecdote. I can't imagine any sort of extended play not revealing the player's disinterest in the topics that kept popping up: eye rolling, sighing, forced by-passing of the obstacle, etc. (Now you have me paranoid about every game I've ever run.)</blockquote>\nThe thing is that Jacob <i>did</i> really enjoy the game and <i>did</i> really enjoy the investigation parts of the game as well.  But what really hooked him was the whole "Monster I am, lest a monster I become" thing.  He really dug the humanity thing and the moral choices.  Which at first didn't come up much, but when I threw a bit of that into the mix after a feew sessions various people's eyes lit up around the table, including Jacob's.   So I knew to put plenty of that in from then on, but the thing is that it would have been nice to have known that from day 0.  Plus, the guy had effectively written that he wanted a heavily investigative focus on his character sheet.  As had two of the other four players too.  I know for a fact that one of them really <i>did </i> want investigation as a focus, I've gamed with him before and since and that's his bag.  The other was playing a vice detective, so yeah, I was pretty sure that was what he wanted.<br/><br/>JD, I tend to go a stage further with character creation.  I play fairly trad style games most of the time and we all create our characters together.  It starts with the concepts flying about and then people make sure they're creating characters who work together (socially, fictionally and mechanically) and stuff like that.  But the creation process always starts with "Think of what you want to do in this game."  Then as a group, we settle on concepts which fit those activities.  Previously, I'd crunch the numbers and do the mechanics of character creation based on the notes the players made during the creation session.  But lately we've been playing Savage Worlds and, to be honest, it's pretty easy and intuitive to create exactly the character you want (within the power level restriction we agree on) even if you aren't that familiar with the system.<br/><br/>So if it starts with "I want to be a bad-ass knife fighter" we agree concepts which fit that straight off and I write "Knife Fights" on the "List of stuff the players want" and we all agree on a type of character appropriate to the setting which we're all happy having in the party.<br/><br/>John, the problem with the Keys as presented in tSoY for example is that when I first discussed it with/showed it to other gamers, a lot of them pretty much said "well, obviously you take the key of bloodlust because fights happen all the time in RPGs"...<br/><br/>Agon is the Mac Daddy of reward/flag games, because, well, as far as I can tell from my experiences with it you can earn glory from literally any skill at all.  So anything you want to do you can, and you'll get rewarded for it.  But I think I'd have liked to see that explicitly laid out in the text, something along the lines of "build the character you want to play, you'll earn glory for doing pretty much whatever you want so just grab the skills which sound like you want to use them a lot and work from there."  It would also have been nice if there was something along the lines of "you're better off being good and a few things and bad at a few things rather than OK at everything".  I mean, that's pretty obvious from the rules, but having it laid out explicitly in the text would have sped up the process slightly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_91537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt" title="Matt"><img alt="Matt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/6464691/920923"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt">Matt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/91537/#Comment_91537" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-30T05:06:11+00:00" title="August 30, 2007  5:06AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rich, I know what you mean.

My GM might then get the idea to put a high-profile Origami Tournament into the game.  So, he takes us to Origamitown where the 500 best Origami artists in the city compete.  We had talked all about what origami can do, made a cool subsystem for origami, had discussed it at length.  But, it turns out I had taken Origami because I thought it would be sweet to have a unique skill that was not likely to be shared by any of the townspeople.  Suddenly, I'm totally dissapointed in my character!  <br/><br/>It's great to build systems that give the GM clues as to what you want out of the game, but it's always a crapshoot.

That whole (gigantic) aspect of communication is critical in understanding peoples' needs, seeing what's working and what isn't.

The players are the ones who are supposed to find ways of using the abilities they want to use.
