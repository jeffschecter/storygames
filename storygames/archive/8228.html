That's okay.  Also, some folks might disagree with the interpretations of certain stories found below.  That's also okay.  That's part of what stories are about:  different interpretations.</i><br/><br/><b>LIT 101 IN A NUTSHELL</b><br/>Let\u2019s start with the first thing here:  how, generally speaking, is a story created?  Five easy steps:<br/><br/>1) Create a fictional character.  Or more, if you want, but let\u2019s use one guy for this explanation.  We\u2019ll call this guy \u201cthe protagonist.\u201d<br/>2) Put the protagonist in an untenable situation that demands action on his part.  For the situation to demand action from the protagonist, he must a) be in a position to do something about it, and b) have some reason to care about it.  His position can be desperate (or not), and his reason can be personal (or not).<br/>3) Have the protagonist take action stemming from his personal fiber.  His actions must reflect, in some way, what kind of person he is.  Whether this means keeping in line with his personal tenets, breaking from them, or some combination thereof.<br/>4) Have the situation react to the protagonist\u2019s actions.  This one\u2019s pretty straightforward, right?  This is where the situation pushes back, usually through one or more antagonists.<br/>5) Continue the action until the situation resolves (becomes tenable again) in some way due in some part to the protagonist\u2019s actions.  The situation can resolve for better or for worse.  The protagonist\u2019s actions might save the day or spell doom for everyone; it doesn\u2019t matter, as long as his actions actually had some manner of impact on how the thing resolved.<br/><br/>And you\u2019re done.  You\u2019ve just created a story.  If you do those five things, you create a story, whether you mean to or not.  And you know what else?  If you look at that story, if you look at how certain actions led to certain outcomes in the plot, and the reasons behind those actions, and above all look at the ultimate resolution of it all, you will find that the story expresses a theme, a meaning, a statement on some aspect of the human experience.  Whether you meant it to or not.<br/><br/>If you\u2019re gonna make a story, there\u2019s an advantage do doing this stuff on purpose, being attentive and mindful of the process:  it will be easier to make a story that you find satisfying.<br/><br/>How do you find theme in a story?  Well, first off, lemme say that with most people, theme registers unconsciously.  It\u2019s why stories resonate with you, and it\u2019s where that feeling of satisfaction comes from when you finish reading a story that really resonated.  It\u2019s why a movie with stunning production but a poor script can leave you feeling empty (see <i>Terminator 3</i>), and it\u2019s why a movie with sub-par acting and production can be redeemed by a good script (see <i>Terminator</i>). You don\u2019t have to analyze theme to enjoy stories, or to create them.<br/><br/>Odds are, however, that getting into the habit of analyzing stories for theme will make your experience of stories (enjoying and creating) that much more rich and resonant.  Now, this is, in fact, a skill.  It\u2019s like learning to understand jazz or classical music.  (Note that I didn\u2019t say \u201clearning to like\u201d; whether you like it or not is a different matter.  I\u2019m talking about <i>understanding </i>it.)<br/><br/>That\u2019s Lit 101 in a nutshell, and it\u2019s the bare minimum you need to make stories intentionally.<br/><br/><b>THEME &amp; THE DEATH STAR</b><br/>Let\u2019s look at an example.  F\u2019rinstance, when Luke destroys the Death Star by a) listening to the memory of his mentor, b) turning off his targeting computer, and c) using the Force instead.  That seems to be saying something about being guided by faith, instinct, and your heart rather than by cold reason.  Since it works, it seems to be saying something positive about those things.  That it\u2019s good to be guided by faith, instinct, and heart rather than by cold reason alone.  (If it hadn\u2019t worked, we\u2019d be looking at a statement against hokey religions and sentimentality, in favor of cold, clear reason and order.)  Whether you agree with that statement or not is a different matter; it\u2019s merely an argument that the story is presenting.  Which is what a theme is.<br/><br/>Now, putting it in a simple sentence might seem a drastic simplification.  That\u2019s because it is.  It took a whole damn movie to make the statement that <i>Star Wars </i>(or, fine, fine, <i>Star Wars Episode IV:  a New Hope</i>) makes; it doesn\u2019t really come down to one sentence, or even to one moment.  Expressing in such a way is just an abstraction, something that points at the heart of the story, the true theme, which is something that really can\u2019t be expressed precisely into a simple statement \u2013 but it can be expressed through a story. <br/><br/>The context is very, very important.  Notice how the Empire can be interpreted to represent cold reason over faith and heart.  They are dedicated to bringing order and hegemony to the galaxy, even if that means blowing up planets and choking the shit out of your own guys.  Do you see how the movie <i>shows </i>us that, by having the Empire actually blow up a planet, and by having Darth Vader actually choke the shit out of one of his own guys?  Look at how cold and antiseptic their ships\u2019 interiors are; compare that to the rugged interior of the Millenium Falcon.  Compare the Empire\u2019s ominous, de-personalizing uniforms to the ragged robes, travelworn shirts &amp; pants, and thick, matted fur of the heroes.  See how one side could be said to stand for cold reason, and the other for heart, faith, and instinct?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181195/#Comment_181195" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-02T10:50:37+00:00" title="December  2, 2008 10:50AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>GREEKS &amp; VIOLENCE</b><br/>Let\u2019s take a moment from the <i>Iliad </i>by Homer.  Achilles, the greatest warrior on the Greek side of the war, has just killed Ajax, the greatest warrior on the Trojan side.  He ties Ajax\u2019s corpse to the back of his chariot and drags it around the walls at top speed, shouting and exhulting, glorying in the might and skill and prowess proved by his deadly deed.  When Achilles is done with that, Ajax\u2019s father comes out from the gates into the No-Man\u2019s-Land, runs to his fallen son, and weeps.  Then Achilles approaches the old man, embraces him, <i>and weeps also.</i><br/><br/>Put that in your story-pipe and smoke it.  The <i>Iliad </i>is complicated, nuanced, and sometimes ambiguous.  I certainly can\u2019t state the theme in a simple sentence.  The <i>Iliad </i>is, among other things, a serious statement on man\u2019s sordid love affair with violence, all the more so because it acknowledges both the horror and the beauty of it.  Unlike <i>Star Wars</i>, it doesn\u2019t draw clear-cut lines around things.  It doesn\u2019t say, \u201chere\u2019s violence, and here\u2019s love, and here\u2019s why one is better.\u201d  What it does is show us people caught up in the unarrested momentum of violence, reveling in its glories, and weeping at its horrors.  We see suffering breed suffering, and we see love breed suffering also.  (And, those of you who have read <i>The Rustbelt</i>, do you see why I cite the Iliad as an influence?)<br/><br/>Here, let\u2019s look at the related play, <i>Agamemnon </i>by Aeschylus. Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter to Artemis so that the Greek ships would have the wind they needed to reach Troy.  When he gets home, his wife Clytemnestra kills him for it.  Then their son, Orestes, kills Clytemnestra for killing his father.  Orestes is put on trial for this, and acquitted of charges:  his actions are found to be just.<br/><br/>Look at that.  Agamemnon kills his own daughter so that his army can get to a city where they will kill more people, and many of their own people will be killed, and society calls it a \u201csacrifice.\u201d  Clytemnestra is like, \u201cfuck that, you killed my daughter,\u201d so she takes revenge.  Society calls that killing \u201cmurder.\u201d  When Orestes kills her, his own mother, society calls it \u201cjustice.\u201d<br/><br/>There\u2019s even a little more to it:  Clytemnestra doesn\u2019t kill Agamemnon alone, she does it with the aid of her lover, Aegisthus, who is avenging the hideous murders of his brothers at the hand of Agamemnon\u2019s late father, Atreus.  Orestes also kills Aegisthus, and is acquitted of that charge as well.  There\u2019s also the fact that the court system that acquitted Orestes was a new thing, replacing the traditional system of justice in which murder was avenged by the next of kin, only to have the avenger himself revenged upon, in a bloody cycle; so, perhaps, from all this suffering, some wisdom of civilization was born.<br/><br/>Put that in your story-pipe and smoke it.  See the cycle of violence?  See the inability of man to break free from it?  See the minds of men finally justifying it, to put an end to it?  Or are they just justifying it to shield themselves from the horror of it?<br/><br/><b>CONFLICT, ESCALATION, &amp; WHY HAN SOLO SHOT FIRST</b><br/>(cont.)<br/><br/>In Lit 101 terms, the thing that makes the situation untenable is called the conflict.  When this conflict is finally dealt with, the situation is once again tenable.  But the conflict is never dealt with easily.  It takes a big bang, like blowing up the Death Star, to do it.  That big bang is what Lit types call a climax.<br/><br/>To get to the climax, you gotta raise the stakes of the conflict.  Lit types call this the escalation or the rising action.  It starts where the conflict is introduced, and climbs gradually upward until you hit the climax.<br/><br/>Let\u2019s go back to Star Wars.  It starts with a young man inadvertently receiving a mysterious message, and it ends up with that same young man blowing up the Death Star.  Now look at the escalation between those two points:  Luke\u2019s family is killed, he learns that the Empire is behind this, he learns that the Dark Lord holding the reins killed his father, he is forced to hook up with smugglers, Leia\u2019s planet is blown up, the wrath of the Empire is turned directly at Luke and his comrades for rescuing Leia, Luke\u2019s mentor is killed by the same man who killed his father.  (Never mind that Darth Vader <i>is </i>his father; I\u2019m speaking strictly within the bounds of Episode IV, as the story would be understood when it was the only film of the series made.  But, just for fun, know this:  when Darth Vader reveals that he is Luke\u2019s father in Episode V, that\u2019s \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 escalation.)<br/><br/>That\u2019s some bog-standard escalation, in some very obvious terms.  There are, of course, ways to make escalation more gripping, and there are ways that it can fail to be gripping.  Let\u2019s take it to the tape.  You probably know that there\u2019s two versions of the Mos Eisley scene:  one in which Greedo shoots first, and one in which Han Solo shoots first.  I prefer the one where Han shoots first.  Lemme tell you why.<br/><br/>In story terms, it\u2019s escalation that Luke has to partner with smugglers \u2013 <i>criminals </i>\u2013 in order to accomplish his goals.  He\u2019s already a farm boy in over his head, and now he\u2019s even more over his head.  But there\u2019s a thing here.  If we know that Han Solo is trustworthy, a good guy, then that\u2019s not much escalation; where\u2019s the tension?  It\u2019s far more interesting if we don\u2019t know whether Han Solo is trustworthy, at least not yet.  Even better is if we\u2019re shown evidence suggesting that Han Solo really might be untrustworthy.  That\u2019s why he shoots first:  to make Luke and the audience seriously wonder if Han can be trusted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181196/#Comment_181196" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-02T10:51:04+00:00" title="December  2, 2008 10:51AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (cont.)<br/><br/>Do you see how \u201cLuke hooks up with shady characters\u201d is more escalation than \u201cLuke acquires more allies\u201d?

Develop an eye for this.

So the "steps 1-5" look a bit backwards to me. Actually, that's the root of that whole "brain damage" thing that was going around way back when.<br/><br/>IIRC, in literary circles a story is made when you create a situation first. *THEN* you populate that situation with characters. Not the other way around. <br/>I mean, the other way around works and all, at times, but it seems to be the difference between a sort of ground-up fiction (novels, movies, etc) and genre fan fiction (take a pre-existing hero/make a hero, then think up a situation to throw them into).<br/><br/>Or maybe it's just looking at the same thing ("story") through two different lenses ("the story is the important thing, the characters are what make the story come to life" vs "the characters are the important things, the story is what shows off the nature of the characters".<br/><br/>In my situation, frex, turning my gaming setup on its head (by making up a situation *before* making up characters, rather than making up characters then putting them in a situation) made my gaming more fun by like a billion percent.

That is, you could think of a guitar as a physical object representing the collection of several musical techniques, including <i>barre </i>chords, <i>arpeggio</i>, harmonics, chicken pickin\u2019, bends, <i>rasgueado</i>, the <i>golpe</i>, and so many other things it would take a book to list and describe them all (which is why they write such books).  All of these techniques have effects when applied to actual musical passage, and the musician chooses from among them to create the kind of music he wants.  <br/><br/>When you endeavor to make a story in gaming, your instrument is the game.<br/><br/>First order of business:  look at the game text you will be using.  Game texts consist of three things:  source, techniques, and advice on how to use those techniques.  Setting details, illustrations, maps, original fiction, references to outside fiction; that\u2019s source.  Rules, mechanics, charts, divisions of authority, prep outlines; those are techniques.  And the advice is anywhere the author tells you what such-and-such rule is for, when to bring such-and-such mechanic into play.<br/><br/>Consider the kind of story you\u2019d like to make.  Take whatever source seems potentially appropriate, and put in your bag of tricks.  Look at the techniques, then look at the advice.  Take whatever advice is applicable to what you\u2019re trying to do, and keep it in mind; ignore the rest.<br/><br/>Now it\u2019s time to look at the techniques again, and look at them hard.  What you\u2019re looking for in the techniques is ways to use them to facilitate the Five Easy Steps.  And there\u2019s surprisingly few techniques out there that can\u2019t be turned to this purpose with a little ingenuity.<br/><br/><b>CHARACTER TECHNIQUES</b><br/>When you create a character, you need to be doing it with an eye to Step 3.  That is, you need to be thinking about what kind of person the character is, and how that can be reflected in his actions.<br/><br/>There\u2019s good news here:  every game that I\u2019ve ever read has techniques that you can use for this.<br/><br/>The straightest path is something where you just write out a statement of who the character is.  This will get the job done, but you also want things that will interface with other mechanics, for reasons I\u2019ll try to explain further on.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most obvious technique for this is the DitV-style trait.  Traits are all about describing what sort of person the character is.  The dice value attached to it tells us even more; there\u2019s a world difference between \u201cI love my old rifle 1d4\u201d and \u201cI love my old rifle 3d10.\u201d  For a fun little thing, consider a character with \u201cFast draw 3d12\u201d and another character with \u201cFastest draw in the West 2d8.\u201d  First guy\u2019s got better dice; is he faster than the other?  Heck no!  It says right there that he\u2019s fastest draw in the West, so bygod he is.  But those dice values do say that the first guy is <i>more likely to get things done</i> by using his fast draw than the faster man.<br/><br/>Another one that\u2019s pretty obvious is D&amp;D-style alignment.  You can tell by a guy\u2019s  Chaotic Good alignment that he doesn\u2019t give a shit for laws, social mores, or codes of conduct, but he doesn\u2019t want to be cruel or manipulative of others, and he\u2019ll probably stand up against cruelty when it shows up.  You can tell by a guy\u2019s Lawful Evil alignment that he could dedicate himself to bringing order and hegemony to the galaxy, even if that means blowing up planets and choking the shit out of his own guys.<br/><br/>A little but further out, you\u2019ve got classes.  When someone writes down \u201cPaladin\u201d on their character sheet, then right away you know that this character will be the kind of person to uphold chivalrous ideals, sacrifice himself for the greater good, and destroy evil wherever it is to be found.  What does it tell you about a character when the sheet says \u201cRanger\u201d?  \u201cBarbarian\u201d?  \u201cNecromancer\u201d?<br/><br/>But you can even use plain old scores like attributes and skills.  Let\u2019s say I write down on my character\u2019s sheet, \u201cLvl. 5 Rifle Arts\u201d (not a skill schema I\u2019ve actually seen, but I love the way it sounds).  Now, if I wasn\u2019t after story, I could have made that choice for any number of reasons.  But since I <i>am </i>after story, and I\u2019ve got my eye on Step <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, my reason for making that choice is to make a statement about my character.  It\u2019s not a random thing that he\u2019s got Lvl. 5 Rifle Arts \u2013 marksmanship is part of who he is.  Encapsulated in that one skill score is his knowledge of rifles, his potential to bring that ability to bear in a conflict, and an implied history in which he learned the skill (his mentor, his favorite gun, the best shot he ever made, his first kill, etc.).  Guns mean something to him, and a gun means something in his hands.  Every decision to use a gun will reflect on him, and so will every decision not to use a gun.<br/><br/>Even the plainest-jane scores like Strength and Wisdom can be turned to this purpose.  Of course, more colorful ones help.  This is why <i>The Rustbelt </i>has attributes like Grizzled, Cagey, and Uncanny.  <i>kill puppies for satan </i>blew my mind with its schema of Mean, Cold, Fucked Up, and Relentless.  Despite what the book\u2019s explanation of the stats, Mean is not the same as Strength, nor Cold the same as Intelligence.  You don\u2019t roll Mean when you\u2019re doing something requiring strength \u2013 you roll it when you\u2019re being a mean motherfucker.<br/><br/>Develop an eye for this.  Get out a game book, any game book, and look at the character model.  Look at an individual piece of it and think, \u201cHow can I use this to make a statement about a character?\u201d  As an exercise, try matching up particular character techniques with particular kinds of stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181326/#Comment_181326" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-03T09:51:41+00:00" title="December  3, 2008  9:51AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (cont.)<br/><br/><b>SITUATION TECHNIQUES</b><br/>Steps 1 and 2 are very closely entangled.  They\u2019re like conjoined twins.  The characters don\u2019t mean anything without a situation, and the situation doesn\u2019t mean anything without the characters.  And if you screw one up, you\u2019ve pretty much screwed the other one too.  Situation is the cement powder, and character is the water, and together the make the foundation on which the story is constructed.<br/><br/>What a situation technique needs is a way to set up the various elements of the situation, a way to get the characters involved (i.e. provide their position to do something about it, and reason to care), a way to make that situation untenable.  These don\u2019t have to come in any order. <br/><br/>There are plenty of great situation techniques out there \u2013 IAWA\u2019s Oracles and Best Interests, <i>Sorcerer</i>\u2019s Kickers and Relationship Maps, DitV\u2019s Town Creation \u2013 that will get you untenable situations easily and obviously.  As long as you handle them with an eye towards Steps 3 and 4, it\u2019s hard to mess them up.  <br/><br/>In <i>My Life With Master</i>, you know from the moment that you create the Master that the situation is untenable.  As long as the Master lives, there can be no peace, only fear that leads to horror.  Type, Aspect, Fear, and Reason, combined with the Master\u2019s specific details, tell you a great deal about the situation itself, even before any other details are fleshed out.  They also tell you how to get the PCs involved \u2013 as the advice in the book suggests, pointing the minions\u2019 More Than Human and Less Than Human traits at the Master\u2019s traits gives you plenty of wood for the fire.  As for the minions\u2019 reason to care, that\u2019s taken care of by the dysfunctional relationship between them and the Master.<br/><br/><i>Trollbabe</i> has an interesting setup in that the situation may be quite horrible, but it\u2019s pretty much stable until the trollbabe arrives.  It\u2019s the trollbabe\u2019s very presence that makes the situation untenable, and cleverly it\u2019s because she\u2019s in a position to do something about it.  (\u2018Cause she\u2019s a trollbabe!  Just look at her; she\u2019s like, \u201cI will fuck you up!\u201d)  Her reason to care is that everyone on all sides is pushing and pulling for her to do something about it, <i>because </i>she\u2019s in a position to do something about it, and they want her to do it their way.<br/><br/><i>Poison\u2019d</i> has another interesting setup, in that the initial situation is always the same:  Captain \u201cBrimstone\u201d Jack has been poisoned by the cook, who has just been apprehended.  The characters can\u2019t help but care about it \u2013 the assassin must be dealt with, and someone must be captain.  This situation is immediately untenable because the characters are a) desperate and capable of brutality, b) sworn to each other, and c) pursuing conflicting and often mutually-exclusive personal goals.  The fact that one of them is now captain puts such a strain on that arrangement that the latent conflicts cannot remain so for long.<br/><br/>But what if the game you\u2019re using doesn\u2019t provide something like this?  Many games don\u2019t.  In that case, you\u2019ve got to craft situation from the ground up.  Pull some of that source out of your bag of tricks, and that will help out a great deal.  Remember that it\u2019s got to be untenable, and provide the characters with a reason to care and a position to do something about it.<br/><br/>There\u2019s four general ways (that I know of) to do this:  characters + situation, situation + characters,  situation = characters, and characters = situation.<br/><br/><b>Characters + Situation</b>:  this means starting with characters, then coming up with a situation targeted at their personal issues (as determined in Step 1).  The situation is crafted deliberately to offer relevant opportunities (for a price!), put strain on relationships, threaten things held dear, and pose dilemmas.  This requires characters that are pretty well fleshed out from the beginning, and, in my experience, works best when setting is loosely defined.  (This is also the method with which I am most familiar, and is codified into situation techniques in my game <i>The Rustbelt</i>; this is probably why I listed Steps 1 and 2 in the order I did.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181327/#Comment_181327" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-03T09:52:15+00:00" title="December  3, 2008  9:52AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (cont.)<br/><br/><b>Situation + Characters</b>:  this means starting with a situation, then dropping some characters into it.  Typically in this setup, the characters are outsiders, so the issue of giving them a reason to care can be tricky, requiring some communication between the creator of the situation and the creators of the characters in order to produce viable characters.  One way (of many possible ways) to handle that issue is to make it the characters\u2019 jobs to care.  If the situation is a fantasy thing with a villain threatening innocents, perhaps the PCs are a band of knights errant, sworn to root out evil throughout the kingdom.  If the situation is a modern-day thing with a malevolent supernatural entity lurking in a small town, perhaps the PCs are a close-knit group of weirdos and esotericists who have taken it upon themselves to hunt such entities, because they\u2019re the only ones who a) believe in them and b) know how to deal with them (hm.  Sounds like Eerie, Indiana: the RPG).  With this method, detailed setting tends to be more important than detailed characters.<br/><br/><b>Situation = Characters</b>:  this means starting with a situation that <i>implies </i>characters, and using them as the PCs.  That\u2019s what happens when you use Oracles \u2013 the Oracles just provide you a technique for doing this, rather than requiring you to do it on your own.  For this to work, the situation must hinge on several persons who already are in conflict, are in a position to do something about it, and have reasons to care.  From there, it\u2019s just a matter of people choosing which ones they want to play.<br/><br/><b>Characters = Situation</b>:  this means starting with characters who, more-or-less by themselves, imply a situation.  In creating the characters, you deliberately aim them at each other\u2019s issues, such that by simply being who they are and being in close proximity, conflict ensues.  Or you create the characters and then find a way to aim them at each other; either way works.  They have reason to care because the conflicts stem from them personally.  This is what<i> Poison\u2019d</i> does for you (with the death of the captain being just a kick-start), and it is also how you make <i>Wuthering Heights Roleplay</i> rock on ice.<br/><br/><b>STAY TUNED FOR PART 3, IN WHICH WE BUILD ON THE FOUNDATION OF CHARACTER &amp; SITUATION</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181329/#Comment_181329" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-03T09:54:31+00:00" title="December  3, 2008  9:54AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Matthjis!<br/><br/><br/>Hey JD, you can go on ahead and weigh in if you want, because I suspect that part 3 will take me a while longer to write.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181335/#Comment_181335" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-03T10:43:01+00:00" title="December  3, 2008 10:43AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good stuff so far--can't begin to refute (and won't try to extend until Pt.3). One nit, though: I'd use -&gt; instead of = because equality is reflexive, but your description is causal (IF situation THEN characters). The associations using + also "feel" like the wrong symbol is in use, but I can't quite think of something that suggests sequential design (which is your point by ordering characters or situation first). Maybe:<br/>CHARACTERS, situation -and-<br/>SITUATION, characters<br/><br/>Hmm... or maybe not even the all-caps. The comma does imply sequence, though.<br/><br/>Anyhow, the four means are definitely useful as defined. For instance, I have now realized that <i>For Mature Audiences</i> is Characters -&gt; Situation, and there's no inherent entanglement of characters, which is why the game might not be as accessible to folks as I thought it would be (well, that and the fact that it's intended to be played with real personal issues, not made-up fiction). Intriguing... maybe I need an element of rules to "aim" folks more at each other (like, "When you design a Scar, also note who's most likely to be its cause or who you expect to help you heal it" or something).<br/><br/>**sits back to await Pt.3**                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Magnus" title="Magnus"><img alt="Magnus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Magnus">Magnus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181488/#Comment_181488" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T08:33:41+00:00" title="December  4, 2008  8:33AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great stuff, very useful to have in mind when you're planning a roleplaying game. For example, I've had my share of frustration for not giving step 2 the attention it deserves. I guess that's a pretty basic lesson, but characters who are independent, content, with no major goals and no one or nothing that is really important to them are seldom very interesting to play.<br/><br/>The first part of the text seems a bit too normative for my taste, though.<br/><br/>For example, I wouldn't say that your five steps are what <i>makes</i> a story. I would agree that most <i>good</i> stories I've heard, read or seen have included all of these. It's not difficult to think of stories that doesn't, though. Often such stories are a bit dull, but sometimes they are great.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.whiterabbit.net/@port03/Dinesen/BlankPage/blank_page.htm" rel="nofollow">This is one of my favourite stories.</a> Where's the protagonist?<br/><br/>Also, I don't think it's productive to consider a theme "an argument the story is presenting." Not most of the time, anyway. Some stories have themes like that (propaganda, nursery tales and commercials thrive on them) but I often find such stories less engaging (not always, of course).<br/><br/>I think it's more fertile to see a theme as "an issue that the story is treating". It may engage you, seem relevant to you is some way, make you think, but you will do the story a disservice by deciding that it's all about teaching you a certain lesson. Not just because different readers may disagree and that's okay, or because you can't do justice to the theme in a single sentence (you've already mentioned these two objections yourself), but also because a lot may be lost by assuming a story is all bout hammering a message into your head.<br/><br/>When making a story, alone with our Great Novel or in collaboration with our favourite gamers, I don't think we should be wary of treating several themes in one story (though they probably wont all be equally emphasized). A focused theme can make the impact stronger (like in "the blank page"), but diversity can make it richer. There's not one "right" answer here as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>This is all nitpicking, really, but a good essay demands avid nitpickers.

He doesn't have to have Greedo shoot to know that Greedo's about to try to kill him -- he just knows it.  Now, at the time it happens, we don't understand that, but as the movie goes on, and we discover that Han is trustworthy, it becomes something that we can reflect back and see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181535/#Comment_181535" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T11:15:53+00:00" title="December  4, 2008 11:15AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2008 11:20AM by Marshall Burns.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Magnus,\n<blockquote><cite>posted by Marshall Burns</cite>Let\u2019s start with the first thing here: how, generally speaking, is a story created?<br/></blockquote>\n"Generally speaking" is the key word there.

Sets up a lot of tension for the film (maybe Han will just turn Leia over to the Empire?).<br/><br/>But it ALSO allows Han to have a major shift in ideology--putting others before himself, at the very end where his return to the Battle of Yavin saves Luke and, thereby, enables the destruction of the Death Star. He becomes part of a team--for real, not just for profits--joining the Rebellion even though it puts him at far more risk overall (I think it germane to recognize that Lucas imagined him as a former Imperial Pilot, who rescued Chewie and fled).<br/><br/>Just a brief aside--I know your main point at that juncture was to illustrate rising action. But it's a deft bit or work that ALSO gives Han somewhere to which to grow, a way to be more than a foil to Luke (unlike Leia, who at best gains a bit more power and a fiance over the whole story arc), to experience his own character growth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181596/#Comment_181596" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T15:40:12+00:00" title="December  4, 2008  3:40PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was actually about to ask you to un-whisper that, David <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Because, while I don't want this to turn into the "discuss the thematic significance of Star Wars" thread, it illustrates a general point about stories that is a welcome addition to the discussion.<br/><br/>And, Travis, your point also shows another thing:  the total significance of a character's action in the story cannot be grasped until the story is finished.<br/><br/>Magnus,<br/>I don't want you to think I'm just shooting down everything you're saying without thinking about it.

I'll make three claims about themes in a written story to present my position:<br/><br/><b>a) </b>Someone wrote the text. Language is communication, and what any given reader gets out of the text has a lot to do with what the author put in there. <i> Themes come from the author.</i><br/><br/><b>b)</b> The text exists independently of the author. The reader does not have access to the author and can not really know what he "wanted", but he does have access to the text, and so the act of reading is a meeting between text and reader, not author and reader. Every reader reads the same words, and those words can say to him stuff the author never intended. <i>Themes are in the text.</i><br/><br/><b>c)</b> The text is realized in the mind of the reader. Without a reader, the text has no meaning, it is just ink on a paper. Every reader will realize the text differently; no one will get quite the same out of it. <i>Themes are created by the reader.</i><br/><br/>I don't think these three claims exclude each other - I think they are all true.<br/><br/>In a roleplaying situation there is no text, of course - or rather, all the players are "authors", the "text" is what every player says and does, and the story is still realized within the minds of each individual player.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marshall Burns</cite><br/>Third, an argument that is nuanced, complex, multi-layered, and even ambiguous (all of which apply to the theme of the<i>Iliad</i>) is still an argument. Not in the debate sense, y'ken, but in the literary sense.</blockquote>\nIt seems like we really agree on this after all. I thought you were saying that any given story presents one main idea, one statement on a subject, and that is the theme. I don't think that is the best way to understand stories, but now I'm suspecting that I just misunderstood you.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Marshall Burns</cite><br/>I think you've got the cart before the horse a little bit here.

It is key, as you've asserted, that Luke "needs" Han to be "scum and villainy" to ratchet up the tension and make rising action; but it's even MORE key (for RPGs with multiple player characters) that Han changes, evolves, finds his honorable heart again, after years of selfishness and debauchery. Why is that a key entanglement?<br/><br/>Because if you want multiple protagonists, you need multiple vectors of change and multiple character progressions without "collapsing" the original seed that brought them together! No one wants to play a long RPG story arc which is all about some other schlub's "destiny" or what-not, and yet neither does a group of players want to be scattered to the wind pursuing their own "destinies" and limelight (why play together, then?). The Luke and Han thing gives us a sterling example of that: Luke is on his quest, Han needs money, they join, they save each other's lives a few times over and bond (gruffly--the rivalry over Leia helps that, believe it or not), and by the time Luke is fulfilling his "destiny," Han is on board with the Rebellion full-stop (General, even!) and has gone through at least as much character growth as the farm boy cum Jedi Knight.<br/><br/>Two characters, two stories, who knows how many tropes and themes "pinged"... and yet at no time disentangled or divergent, even when separated by light-years.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181776/#Comment_181776" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-05T15:16:10+00:00" title="December  5, 2008  3:16PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nothing to add at this point, except to say that I'm enjoying this thread immensely.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's giving me ideas to work with, in terms of story structure, when it comes time to revise my novel.

The discussions on steps 1 and 2 (character and situation) make me all warm and tingly. Other steps will be addressed further down the road, no doubt, but step 3 (where the character's reaction to situation reflects who he is) is something that can obviously benefit from technique. Expanding on the earlier point about all existing techniques having some means of expressing who the character is, all techniques similarly have some means of reflecting who the character is in his reactions to the situation.<br><br>Seeing through the framework, I can now see where much of my dissatisfaction with a lot of existing techniques came from. With regards to rules, strength and rifle arts form pieces of who a character is, it's true. But for me a lot of existing rules never went deep enough. First, at Step 1, in terms of describing the character, the stats aren't a direct explanation of who the character is in story terms. Having Rifle Arts at Lv. 5 implies a lot of things about a character, but to find out what rifles and rifle arts actually mean to a character you'd have to dig deeper.<br/><br/>Second, at Step 2, in terms of situation, how the rifle comes into the situation is primarily in the GM's hands rather than the player's. Having lots of things to shoot is one way to express who the character is. So is having a rival who was neck-and-neck with the character through training, or having the wife of a guy he shot showing up. If the player had a say in creating the situation, she would be more likely to think the character has a reason to care. Of course, as long as the GM and player are in good communication the player does have a say, whether directly by making specific requests or indirectly by the GM picking up on her cues. Some find that good enough, others, like me, would like that control to be more fluid and direct.<br/><br/>In a similar vein, at Step 3, a lot of existing techniques restrict the ways in which the player could reflect the character in his response to the situation. This is directly related to how the character is expressed in rule terms (Step 1), since that expression--what's on the sheet, at its simplest--has a bearing on what the player can use in responding to a situation. Many rules cover firing away with a rifle with Rifle Arts Lv 5 or its equivalent. But choosing not to shoot because of the memory of the time when he shot his father? Doable, of course, but outside the player's control of technique. There's often no benefit or push in the direction of expressing a character in those ways, and to that extent the technique (rule in this case) might not get in the way of story, but it also disengages from story to that extent by getting the hell out of the way.<br/><br/>Compare that to Dogs in the Vineyard, where "I shot my father 2d10" would bring those dice into the resolution when, say, the character clutches at his rifle in the heat of an argument but slowly relaxes his grip, remembering the sight of his father's blood splashed across the snow. Or Spirit of the Century, where the same thing would be an aspect compel for "I shot my father" that earns the player a Fate Point. In both cases the rules facilitate the reflection of who the character is in his reaction to the situation. Some prefer rules to engage with the story in this way, others prefer rules to get out of the way of story and have good reasons for that preference. But it's important to understand the distinction, I think.<br/><br/>In sum: Rules and other aspects of technique interact with story in varying ways, and understanding how that interaction happens is an important element of choosing and using rules. Different configurations appeal to different people and games, but knowing how to fit the means (the rules, for instance) to the ends (the type of story you want) will facilitate the fun.<br/><br/>Bit choppy, and maybe jumping too far ahead, but I wanted to share how the framework is working out in my understanding of gaming. Maybe it should go to a separate thread to keep the coherence of this one.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182142/#Comment_182142" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-08T11:03:13+00:00" title="December  8, 2008 11:03AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eldir,<br/><br/>"In sum: Rules and other aspects of technique interact with story in varying ways, and understanding how that interaction happens is an important element of choosing and using rules.

I've spent a lot of time studying anthropology, especially in the vein of counter-examples that challenge some of the assumptions that literate, industrial societies make about "human nature" and other such generalities, and lately I've especially focused on stories.  I quite like what you've posted, but in the interest of illustrating some of the other models that a story might follow, I'd offer the following:\n<blockquote cite="Marshall Burns">2) Put the protagonist in an untenable situation that demands action on his part. For the situation to demand action from the protagonist, he must a) be in a position to do something about it, and b) have some reason to care about it. His position can be desperate (or not), and his reason can be personal (or not).</blockquote>\nI think this presupposes something that has become very common in modern literature, since at least Shakespeare, where the protagonist stands in a very conservative mode, as the hero trying to preserve the <em>status quo</em>.  So he finds himself in an untenable position; but many stories tell about protagonists who <em>create</em> the untenable position.  I have in mind here many Trickster stories, where we begin with our protagonist (the Trickster) in a perfectly tenable situation, which he proceeds to make untenable, for no real reason but his own whim.\n<blockquote cite="Marshall Burns">3) Have the protagonist take action stemming from his personal fiber. His actions must reflect, in some way, what kind of person he is. Whether this means keeping in line with his personal tenets, breaking from them, or some combination thereof.</blockquote>\nThis one I really don't know about.  Again, it certainly marks a definite common pattern in modern literature, but not all stories really focus on the personal fiber of the protagonist.\n<blockquote cite="Marshall Burns">5) Continue the action until the situation resolves (becomes tenable again) in some way due in some part to the protagonist\u2019s actions. The situation can resolve for better or for worse. The protagonist\u2019s actions might save the day or spell doom for everyone; it doesn\u2019t matter, as long as his actions actually had some manner of impact on how the thing resolved.</blockquote>\nDon't many stories underline the inability of the protagonist to affect the outcome quite explicitly?\n<blockquote cite="Marshall Burns">That\u2019s Lit 101 in a nutshell, and it\u2019s the bare minimum you need to make stories intentionally.</blockquote>\nI don't disagree that you have Lit 101 there in a nutshell, but I don't know if that really wraps up the bare minimum to make stories intentionally.  For one thing, as mentioned above, I don't know if you really need all of those things: Do you need the protagonist in an untenable position, or might the protagonist himself create the untenable position, rather than find himself in it?  Must the protagonists' actions reveal his personal fiber, or could a story say very little about the character, instead focusing on social relationships, ritual bonds, or other parables?  Does a protagonist have to have an impact on the outcome, or might he find himself a powerless observer?  I think you'll find several stories that defy those points.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I think the usual literary theory you get in Lit 101 glosses over some points that you <em>do</em> need, in "the bare minimum ... to make stories intentionally."  I've cited Harold Scheub's <em>Story</em> on these boards before, but it seems relevant here again.  In his study of oral cultures, he found common elements that I think get to a much more fundamental "bare minimum" of what a story needs: namely, Image, Narrative, Rhythm and Trope.  Your points lay out a very common type of narrative, but I don't know if it counts even as a universal narrative like you seem to claim.  But even if it does, I rather agree with Scheub when he writes:\n<blockquote cite="Harold Scheub, Story, p. 47">Story is never simply a cause-and-effect organization of events.  It is that, necessarily, but that is not the reason for its existence.  We have<br/>seen that the narrative is not even the first aspect of storytelling that a child learns: patterning is.  To stop with an analysis simply of narrative, and thereby to ignore the more critical aspects of storytelling\u2014emotion, rhythm and pattern, trope\u2014is to dwell on only the most obvious and the simplest aspect of the tradition.  It is true, narrative is inviting because it can be studied in an almost mechanical way.  It is possible, as Propp has demonstrated, to anticipate the organization of events in a story.  The reason for the attractiveness of this one aspect of story is that it can be scientifically analyzed, charted, and graphed.  But in the end, it tells little about story.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182489/#Comment_182489" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-09T16:37:18+00:00" title="December  9, 2008  4:37PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote cite="Marshall Burns">The Iliad is complicated, nuanced, and sometimes ambiguous. I certainly can\u2019t state the theme in a simple sentence. The Iliad is, among other things, a serious statement on man\u2019s sordid love affair with violence, all the more so because it acknowledges both the horror and the beauty of it. Unlike Star Wars, it doesn\u2019t draw clear-cut lines around things.</blockquote>\nTo what degree does the story say that, though, and to what degree do we simply see that from our perspective?  Perhaps that doesn't matter to your case, but I would put forward that to Homer, Achilles' behavior seemed as straightforward as Luke Skywalker's does to us.  We have a different experience and expectation with violence today, compared to the ancient Greeks.  To us, Achilles' behavior seems ambiguous.  How can he glory so savagely in Hector's death one moment, and the next, weep with Priam before the gates of Troy?  To Homer, though, this presented no great dilemma.  Achilles acted as a straightforward hero, from the Greek word for aristocrat.  He executes necessary violence skillfully, receives praise for it, but does not expand the feud unnecessarily.  Particularly the influence of Christianity has changed this relationship with violence.  We generally consider violence as something much more unabashedly negative than the Greeks ever did, so we have a harder time reconciling this violent (negative) behavior of Achilles after killing Hector, with the compassionate (positive) behavior he shows with Priam.  I think to the Greeks, Achilles presented as clear-cut and unambiguous a course of action as Luke Skywalker firing down the exhaust shaft of the Death Star.  No, it doesn't say, "here's violence, and here's love, and here's why one's better than the other," it says, "here's a good aristocrat (Achilles), and here's a bad one (Agamemnon), and here's why one's better than the other."<br/><br/>Likewise, <em>Agamemnon</em> seems conflicted mostly from our own anachronistic point of view.  To the Greeks, it presented a very consistent theme: Agamemnon acted according to social rules when he sacrificed their daughter; Clytemnestra acted according to natural (in this case, maternal) instinct in taking her revenge; Orestes upholds social rules again, like his father, in killing his mother in revenge.  The Oresteia focuses very much on the conflict of social vs. natural laws, and in every case repeats the theme: "The conflict with natural laws can seem upsetting, but we need to uphold the social laws nonetheless."<br/><br/>To someone else, with different priorities, perspectives and values, <em>Star Wars</em> could just as well hold very ambiguous themes and meanings.  I think in all three examples, the <em>intended</em> themes (which I think you meant to focus on) seem relatively straightforward.  The more ambiguous themes you've pointed out in Greek literature seem to have more to do with the differing perspective granted to us by the anachronistic projection of values the authors themselves did not necessarily share.\n<blockquote cite="David Artman">A string of comets is about to hit Jupiter. That's a situation. it becomes a story in the context of human experience: we've never see that before!</blockquote>\n<em>Dramatis personae:</em> Jupiter, Comet 1, Comet 2, ... Comet N\n<blockquote cite="Magnus">This is one of my favourite stories. Where's the protagonist?</blockquote>\nI'd say that story presents two different narratives, tied into a single story by rhythm and trope (which actually nicely illustrates my earlier point that narrative only gives us a small part of what makes a story).  In the first narrative, the old storyteller plays the protagonist; in the second, the flax does.  Image, rhythm and trope unite them, in a kind of metaphorical doublet of the transformation from potential (the flax brought from the Holy Land, the young girl learning from her grandmother) to storyteller (the blank page, the old woman).  That principle\u2014that all stories have protagonists\u2014I can't take issue with, particularly in the animist root of storytelling, where other-than-human persons (like flax) abound, and act with the same volition we casually perceive in them.  But, I also tend to think that story has an inherent animist bias, no matter how much we try to expunge it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182688/#Comment_182688" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T15:03:48+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  3:03PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 11, 2008 11:08AM by Marshall Burns.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/>I don't want to be dismissive or anything, but it's my thinking that the storytelling of oral traditions (and also myth in general) is in an <i>entirely </i>different ballpark.

Perhaps that doesn't matter to your case, but I would put forward that to Homer, Achilles' behavior seemed as straightforward as Luke Skywalker's does to us. We have a different experience and expectation with violence today, compared to the ancient Greeks. </blockquote>\nI don't care about the author's intent.  I think that theme is entirely out of his hands -- he sets the ball rolling, and then it's out of his hands.  I'm only interested in audience interpretation, because that's where the rubber hits the road.<br/><br/>Considering, say, <i>Oedipus Rex</i> from the author's point of view, ruins it for me.  I like my take on it better:  Oedipus is only guilty of acting according to his nature, which is no crime at all; hubris is bullshit, and the gods are pricks.  It pisses me off, and I like it that way.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jason</cite>3) Have the protagonist take action stemming from his personal fiber. His actions must reflect, in some way, what kind of person he is. Whether this means keeping in line with his personal tenets, breaking from them, or some combination thereof.</blockquote>\nThis one I really don't know about. Again, it certainly marks a definite common pattern in modern literature, but not all stories really focus on the personal fiber of the protagonist.<br/><br/><br/>Seriously, if the character's actions don't stem from who he is, then he's not a character; he's a pawn.  Characters have thoughts, beliefs, hopes, and experiences, and those all inform their decisions.  You don't have to <i>focus</i> on this; I'm just pointing out that you can't <i>ignore</i> it.\n<blockquote><blockquote cite="Marshall Burns">5) Continue the action until the situation resolves (becomes tenable again) in some way due in some part to the protagonist\u2019s actions. The situation can resolve for better or for worse. The protagonist\u2019s actions might save the day or spell doom for everyone; it doesn\u2019t matter, as long as his actions actually had some manner of impact on how the thing resolved.</blockquote>\nDon't many stories underline the inability of the protagonist to affect the outcome quite explicitly?</blockquote>\nCan you unpack that?  I really can't think of a story where the actions of the protagonist didn't impact the way things turned out.  I can think of millions where he didn't get what he <i>wanted</i>, but none where he had no impact whatsoever.  If he's a powerless observer, he's not a protagonist.  At best, he's just a character we like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182691/#Comment_182691" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T15:23:41+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  3:23PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Marshall,<br/><br/>What about stories where the protagonist didn't take any action, or any actions with impact... but the story <i>changed the protagonist</i>, as opposed to the other way around?<br/><br/>(I'm just musing out loud, by the way, not arguing with you.

If they don't take actions that change the story, then they're simply not a protagonist. They may still be important characters to the story.. If the story is told from the point of view of a character within it, but they're not who the character is about, then they still play a very important role, because their telling is flavored by their character. Still, this character isn't likely to be a protagonist. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoing a little digging, the very term protagonist is based in a greek term for competitor, someone who strives to overcome, to achieve. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe story may change the protagonist. I don't think any definition of the word excludes that. The story will almost certainly change other characters as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo use an example from my current reading, I'm reading Mistress of the Empire, by Raymond Feist and Janny Wurtz. Mara, the Lady of the Acoma, is the protagonist. She has a powerful lord for a husband, and several skilled and formidable advisors. Arakasi, her spy master, is in the process of attempting the impossible, getting a spy into the City of Magicians, while attempting to foil the spy master of Mara's chief enemy, who is possibly better than him. He will do many things in the story, of that I'm certain. But I don't think he is a protagonist. His actions will change the story, but they're not his choices. They are done at the behest of his mistress, Mara. In really-real life, where there are no such things as protagonists, he makes his own decisions. In another story with many of the same events, he might be the protagonist. But in this story, where he is the instrument of Mara's will, he is the tool that is used to enact some of her decisions, he isn't a protagonist. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy contrast, in the previous book, there were two protagonists. Kevin the barbarian slave acted as the tool of Mara's will in many cases, but he made his own decisions, he had his own goals, and his actions changed Mara, and changed situations. He took an untenable situation and changed it. Now, he was a supporting protagonist, but I think he was one, nonetheless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182710/#Comment_182710" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T16:41:36+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  4:41PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just for curiosity's sake:<br/><br/>What would you say about those stories that go something like:<br/><br/>"When I was seven years old, I saw my father beat my mother [...description...] and I watched as he was arrested and taken away. I went home that night convinced I would never hurt a woman." (Or maybe even just: "I was shaken to the fiber of my being." No decision on the part of the narrator, if you consider that an "action".)<br/><br/>Now, I can't imagine that going on for very long without the narrator doing SOMETHING, or the main character within the story taking on the role of a protagonist, but there are many short stories that are somewhat like this. Are they not Story by this definition? If they are, how do they fall within it?<br/><br/>"The Lottery", by Shirley whose-name-I'm-having-trouble-remembering.<br/><br/>The story Magnus posted a link to is another interesting example I haven't seen anyone comment on.<br/><br/>Some of H. P. Lovecraft's short stories.<br/><br/>There are many stories which do not involve the main character/protagonist in any obvious kind of conflict, at least not one in which they can take action. There are many stories which don't have any obvious protagonists.<br/><br/>I'm fully down with Marshall's story creation model, and have seen it used to great effect in story games, books, and films. I wonder about those others, though--are they a different beast altogether, some other "thing", or are they just hard to recognize within that framework (for example, is the entire village in "The Lottery" a "protagonist")?<br/><br/>(By the way, Marshall? I'm totally down with your vision of Oedipus Rex. That's how I see it, too!

There are many things which are called stories that bear little resemblance to each other. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo be specific, in this case we're not talking about the definition of story that amounts to an account of events. If your seven year old example is the entirety of the account of events, then it's not a Story in the same sense as what Marshall is talking about, which for now I will refer to as capital-S Story. There certainly isn't a protagonist. It could be part of a Story, but it's not one by itself. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's story in the sense that you're telling me an account of what happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not familiar with The Lottery.<br/>\n<br/>\nMagnus' story isn't.. a story. Nothing happens. It's not even an account of events, because there aren't any events. It's a description of a place and a way of life, a little bit of how that came to be It's a set piece, but it's not a story. lower-case or capital S. (It's also completely not my taste; I found it difficult to read because of it's somewhat flowery prose, but I forced myself to finish). It may be the foundation for a story, if something were to happen, but it, by itself, isn't a story. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am not overly familiar with H. P. Lovecraft, but I'll try to answer in terms of the one I'm most familiar with, Rats in the Walls. <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, the narrator is definitely the protagonist. We begin with the untenable situation. His ancestral home lies abandoned. He buys it, moves in, restores the property. He descends into the basement and below in search of the truth of the old myths and superstitions told about the place. He's not a hero, by any means, but he fits the definition of the protagonist to a tee.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182738/#Comment_182738" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T19:46:30+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  7:46PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 10, 2008 8:07PM by Burr.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tessie, <i>The Lottery</i> protagonist, definitely affected the outcome.  Halfway through the story, instead of arguing against having the lottery, she argued <i>for</i> its fair conduct -- "'There's Don and Eva,' Mrs. Hutchinson yelled. 'Make them take their chance!'"  By doing so, she set up her own demise.  Last line: "'It isn't fair, it isn't right,' Mrs. Hutchinson screamed, and then they were upon her."<br/><br/>Another such story is Bradbury's "All in a Summer Day," in which children who have never seen the sun lock an Earth-born girl in the classroom closet on the once-in-seven-years day it actually appears.  She's quiet, she's passive, and the ending isn't just.  But she <i>does</i> have a chance to persuade the other children, to undo what she'd previously done which was alienate herself from them, and she fails her roll.<br/><br/><br/>That said, even if there were no hopeful external conflict, the protagonist could still take action in an internal conflict.
