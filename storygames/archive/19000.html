I had this "Achmed Speaks the Truth" idea where this girl could <span style="text-decoration: underline;">make</span> something true just by speaking it... and I was savoring the moment I could show such a surprise to Dario and Luca.<br/>When finally an opportunity arised and I made my descriprion, I was met with an almost simultaneous "<i>Veto! Too much weird and powerful, she definitely can't do that</i>".<br/>What?!<br/>Without the Veto I would have argued that yes, being an Heretic and possibly an Abomination she could have done that, and that it looked perfectly fine (and actually uber-cool) to me... they were just surprised, but surprise is good, right?<br/><br/>Turns out they both (independently) clearly saw it coming and decided they did not like it, but having I not described anything yet, it was all cool... until it wasn't, so they put the Veto on the unwelcome bits.<br/>I was completely blindsided, I didn't expected my idea to not be universally liked... the Veto told me clearly that I was not anymore on the same page as the others, it told me clearly that the others did not want the game to go too much down the rabbit hole with crazy reality-bending displays of unnatural power.<br/>The result?<br/>No arguing, no discussion, just a quick and effective "reality check" and a bunch of very cool ideas to substitute the "offending" ones.<br/>In the end Achmed did something less scenographic but way cooler and more disturbing than what I originally came up with... with the added bonus of totally surprising me (in a good way).<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Conclusions</b>.<br/>From what I'm seeing, the Veto mechanic is havin a "wave-like" development curve.<br/>At first it is very important; people don't know each other and need it to get on the same page.<br/>Then its importance fades, as players start to get accustomed to one another and work in concert.<br/><br/>Now I see it becoming important again as I noticed that the more we all get comfortable with the rules and the more the story flashes out and all the misterius bits start to make sense, the more we tend to "<b>draw conclusions</b>" in our heads.<br/>This kind of ideas tend to have a certain <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inertia</span>, making us a bit blind to what others may prefer; sometimes we all (independently) draw the same conclusion, producing a satisfactiry sense of mutual confirmationand reinforcement, and sometimes we don't, producing friction and dissonance.<br/><br/>Veto is essential here to help us stay on the same page, making the "<i>Awesome, I knew it!</i>" moments the majority, and turning the potential "<i>Damn I don't like this!</i>" ones into very satisfying "<i>Awesome, what a surprise!</i>".                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424460/#Comment_424460" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-19T17:11:51+00:00" title="November 19, 2013  5:11PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2013 7:28AM by Rickard.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been there myself with similar situations while doing collaborative storytelling. Someone says something, and you can tell that everybody else is wriggling in their chairs in dislike. No one says anything, because the irritating element will probably go away. I even remember one time, when we were playing a sword and sorcery adventure, where one guy made up that he attacked some goons with crab. Everybody else were looking at each other, but he was so in to it that we let it pass. Even years after, he still talks about it like it was some kind of highlight.<br/><br/>I think "letting it pass" can be cultural/social, but I think it also can be part of the game as a social contract. In collaborative storytelling, you don't put your fun in front of the others and here is what happens when one player forgets that while the others are holding on to it. Do the others want to put they fun before one other by invoking veto?<br/><br/>I have the same experience as you, that it's a wave-like development, but I wonder if putting your fun before others also could be something that you regress to from previous experiences. <br/>- you play a game where you put your fun before others. In a traditional roleplaying game, you fight for your character.<br/>- you start playing something that's more like collaborative storytelling. The group is trying it out, forming new relations in how to understand each other for this new format.<br/>- you have all found yourself and everything runs smoothly.<br/>- you forget what you learned with this new format.<br/><br/>The reason why the last point happens could be several reasons. One thing I noticed is how the game can break when people are taking shortcuts. During that third step, the group all "knows" how to play - on how to set up the game - so they don't need to do it. I think it can be healthy to always go back and do the setup of a game again as a reminder of what the group doing and what the group is aiming for. Otherwise it can happen that you either regress back to an old playing style, or taking things for granted that doesn't seem important but still helps shaping the game in the way you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424471/#Comment_424471" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T04:34:47+00:00" title="November 20, 2013  4:34AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.<br/><br/>Always assuming good faith and genuine desire to play <b>this</b> game with <b>these</b> people... in my experience most GM-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">full</span> games require the selfless/collaborative approach you mention.<br/>I'm thinking about Montsegur 1244, Fiasco, Shock, Polaris, and others.<br/><br/>You play with an eye always pointed at the overall story... is it good? is it interesting? is it enjoyable for the other players?<br/>Because you are, in a way of speaking, all GMs... the term GM-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">full</span> is very appropriate.<br/>In a way you have to mind the same things a GM will mind; in a decentralized way, in a collaborative way, supported by effective mechanics... but in the end that is what you do, even when the final effect is to deeply involve you in the character's story (like in Montsegur)... you always are a bit Director.<br/><br/>In Dreamwake I strived to have it go the other way around.<br/>I wanted it to be GM-<i><b>less</b></i>.<br/>One of the things I express in the rulebook is that you should play in an "<b>egoist</b>" way.<br/>Think about what you like, and "aggressively" enforce it! ...well, not with these exact words and tones, of course ^_^<br/>What the actual rules say is...\n<blockquote>The exact moment you find yourself wondering <b>IF</b> it\u2019s time to use a Ritual Word it means <b>IT IS</b></blockquote>\nThe idea is that you have the tools to easily and instantly make clear to everybody what you like and how you like it and to instantly enforce it, and the others have the same tools, and those tools also balance and solve an eventual conflict between two or more players wanting to enforce different things at the same time.<br/><br/>You can be "egoist" because <b>this</b> is the best way to show each other your respective true colors and <b>help</b> everyone play better for everyone else.<br/>More than any other mechanic, THIS is the core of the game, pretty much in the same way as "<i>Objectives &amp; Principles</i>" are the core of Apocalypse World and Dungeon World ... if you don't use them, the game breaks.<br/>Or, in Dreamwake, it becomes GM-full, thus exposing itself to the risk of the wave-effect we noticed at our respective tables.\n<blockquote>1 - you play a game where you put your fun before others.

Even years after, he still talks about it like it was some kind of highlight.</blockquote>\nThis to me is a secondary but equally important issue.<br/>If I truly want something I should not be denied by the "tiranny of the majority"... not if we play with an eye to each other (so I feel like I have to refrain myself) ... not if we play for ourselves but get blocked by a Veto-like thingie.<br/><br/>That is why the Veto mechanic both includes your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">right</span> to say "No" and your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">duty</span> to explain "Why Not" so that the Player whose description you just Vetoed can reformulate his idea.<br/>I found out that most of the time the problem is not WHAT you say, but HOW you say it... minor cosmetic changes often solve the situation, meaning that we BOTH get what we wanted, with minimal concessions.<br/><br/>But then there are times when, damn, you truly want that one thing to be just as you imagined it.<br/>For these times Dreamwake offers the <b>Disagreement</b> mechanic... to have players "<i>put their money where their mouth is</i>" and have a clean way to make your idea prevail <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if it truly means so much to you</span>.<br/>Basically it is a strictly regulated auction.<br/><br/>So in the "crab guy" example someone in the group may have avoided such annoying description with a simple Veto.<br/>If it was not such a big issue, the thing could have ended there.<br/>If instead it was such a big issue, the crab guy could have used the Disagreement rule to have things go his way by paying Influence for it (imagine Influence points as the one thing representing XP, money, Fate Points, etc).<br/>In the process the others also have the opportunity to pay to have <b>their</b> idea pass... but bidding in an auction means you TRULY have to want this thing more than the other players.<br/>Especially when every participant pays his last bid no matter what the result is!<br/>So if you bid 5 and then the crab guy bids 6 and now you think bidding 7 is too much and give up... you still end up paying 5 points, even if the crab guy won (and pays 6).<br/>This means no artificial inflation... you either CARE enough to pay (and risk paying for nothing) or you let the others who actually care enough have it their way.<br/><br/>That is exactly what happened when I wanted Achmed to perform freaky reality alterations, and the others stopped me with a Veto.<br/>I asked myself: do I care enough about this, or the alternative they present is good enough for me?<br/>They presented a very cool alternative for free, opposed to have things go my way at a possibly steep cost, so I rolled with it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>In about two years of playtesting Disagreement was only used a handful of times, but when it got used it was a lifesaver.<br/>The same situations in other games would have caused long discussions and have generated abundant social friction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424478/#Comment_424478" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-20T08:13:15+00:00" title="November 20, 2013  8:13AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2013 8:16AM by Rickard.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Always assuming good faith and genuine desire to play <b>this</b> game with <b>these</b> people... in my experience most GM-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">full</span> games require the selfless/collaborative approach you mention.<br/>I'm thinking about Montsegur 1244, Fiasco, Shock, Polaris, and others.<br/><br/>You play with an eye always pointed at the overall story... is it good?

I became aware of this problem last year, and my suggestion was what I wrote in my previous post: to always redo the setup. To always repeat mantras, like your rule about the ritual word. I played my game with eighty people in total, and it's always good with new people, but with my ordinary group that now played it a couple of times, the game kind of falls apart structure-wise. A structure will, like you said: "if you don't use them, the game breaks". Bad structures will break the game, and what I mean with "break the game" is "produce a bad story". A story that the group may, for example, not care about, not being excited about, not knowing how to proceed or similar things.<br/><br/>It seems like you and I have similar solutions, seen from different perspective, on how to solve this issue. I'm currently searching for other solutions. Perhaps the game should always evolve into using new rules/mantras/structures, but I don't know how that could be handled.\n<blockquote>That is why the Veto mechanic both includes your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">right</span> to say "No" and your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">duty</span> to explain "Why Not" so that the Player whose description you just Vetoed can reformulate his idea.<br/>I found out that most of the time the problem is not WHAT you say, but HOW you say it... minor cosmetic changes often solve the situation, meaning that we BOTH get what we wanted, with minimal concessions.</blockquote>\nPlaying with the ritual phrase "Try another way" from <b>Archipelago</b> and having the <a href="http://www.gamingaswomen.com/posts/2013/01/finding-my-o-with-the-x-card/" rel="nofollow" target="_new">X-card</a> present, I noticed another positive effect of having a veto rule. Because you're allowed to say "no" at any point, you can let more things pass. From the contributor, the veto also creates a safe zone, because you don't have to worry about what you bring forth because you know that the others are always allowed to say "no". Just by having that rule, you create an understanding in the group.<br/><br/>The x-card is usually met with smirks and laughs when we introduce it, and I never seen it been used, but I think it's important to always repeat the introduction.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I must say, it's been nice talking to you in these <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18949/dreamwake-the-challenges-of-espionage#Item_10" rel="nofollow" target="_new">two threads</a>.
