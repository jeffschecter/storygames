I realise one of the main points of the game is to setup the setting as a function of traits, so I was thinking of reverse-engineering the process, i.e. the GM assigns some Traits to predefined locations, and the players choose from those Traits.<br/>\nHas anybody tried it? This will be the first time running the game for me, so I hope to "make it right."<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\nAntonio                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_342926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/342926/#Comment_342926" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-15T10:52:40+00:00" title="September 15, 2011 10:52AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a really cool way to do it.

Say "Let's make the City of Theives", and make sure they're making characters with traits that are appropriate to that setting. Writing a list of traits is a good idea. There's a list of "recommended" traits in the game, and you could add to and subtract from that to get the flavour you're going for. Then you can make the map as normal, drawing on all the players' ideas about the City.<br/><br/>Having a strong pre-decided aesthetic (like "City of Theives, in the Hyborian Age) is a really good thing for the game. The game resists too much more canon than that, though, so be prepared to have your idea of what the City of Theives is like challenged by the players' contributions.<br/><br/>I hope the game goes well!<br/><br/>EDIT: I am only human: <a href="http://theunstore.com/index.php/unstore/game/121" rel="nofollow">On Mighty Thews</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabindranath72" title="rabindranath72"><img alt="rabindranath72" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabindranath72">rabindranath72</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343023/#Comment_343023" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-16T03:03:43+00:00" title="September 16, 2011  3:03AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the comments, Simon! <br/>\nWhat do you think about pre-specifying sorcery background as abilities, for example:<br/>\n<br/>\nWise-woman (or cunning-man)<br/>\nSorcerer of the Black Ring<br/>\nKushite Witch-Finder<br/>\nKhitan Sorcerer<br/>\nPictish Shaman<br/>\nRaksha<br/>\n<br/>\nI would then provide some description of what these abilities provide, for example a Black Ring sorcerer would be proficient in Curses, Conjuring and Necromancy.

What you know determines what you can do.<br/><br/>Items:<br/><br/>Say the characters find some golden liquor in some vials. One of the players rolls lore to see if they know anything about it. If they succeed, they can tell you about it, and use a degree of success to remove an injury, if that's what they want. If they fail, we don't know anything about it. They can still drink it, if they like, which sounds dangerous to me. You say "The danger is that it's some kind of poison" or "The danger is that its effects overwhelm you", or whatever you like.<br/><br/>The same is true of all other items. Generally speaking, there is no mechanical enforcement of magical abilities. A thing does what it can do. You don't need special mechanics to tell you that the Beast of Zotar can only be killed by a magical blade, just like you don't need special mechanics to tell you that water is wet. Magical properties of items, just like their nonmagical properties, tell you what is possible in the world.<br/><br/>That said, go ahead and make up rules for magic items if you like. The game is not a delicate flower. It's pretty robust to making up new rules, doing things wrong, and playing things the way they make sense to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_343694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabindranath72" title="rabindranath72"><img alt="rabindranath72" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabindranath72">rabindranath72</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/343694/#Comment_343694" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-23T03:21:50+00:00" title="September 23, 2011  3:21AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 23, 2011 3:27AM by rabindranath72.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you for the suggestions again, Simon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to run a game tomorrow, if time allows probably two scenarios, the first in the City of Thieves and the Tower of the Elephant.<br/>\nThe second one in the southern deserts of Kush, near Xuthal (and if I think the players do what I hope, they might have to deal with Thog the Ancient) :&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI have jotted down a few Hyborian age-specific Abilities (besides the ones above tied to sorcery) which might give some flavour to the game, by mixing racial background with a profession, for example: Bossonian archer, Zingaran freebooter, Whore of Derketo, Free Company mercenary, Kozak raider, Gunderman pikeman, Barachan pirate, Zuagir.<br/>\nAny other suggestions?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to ask some clarifications about the game.<br/>\n1) On page 29, the text describing Major characters is confusing:\n<pre>Major characters have a single ability like minor characters\n(which could be a 10 or 12 sided die), these characters get two\nabilities which they can roll alongside their regular die in\nrelevant conflicts. The GM should feel free to define these\nabilities on the spot, and players too can use facts to suggest\nthem. Major character abilities should be similar in scope to\nnormal abilities. The abilities are given a ten-sided and sixsided\ndice, just like a player\u2019s character.\n</pre>\nHow many abilities do they have? The first sentence is confusing. If it refers to an Attribute-like ability, then it should be d8 (instead of d10 as written) or d12? And this would be all a Minor character would get? The rest of the paragraph then suggests two abilities, d6 and d10, which are in addition to the Attribute-like ability?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) The example on page 23 looks misleading to me. It mentions an Ability "Without Fear" but that seems to be more a Trait, seeing how Traits and Abilities are defined. She could be acting against a Trait of Coward, or according to the Trait Fearless.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also noticed some typos (e.g. "though" used in place of "through" in a few places) and a missing "."

I was thinking that also NPCs had to follow the same pattern of PCs w.r.t. die sizes, so apparently I instead can have a character with a d10 attribute, AND a d10 ability.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ran our first session the last Saturday, and it went quite well. The players liked the game, though I should have probably offered them more incentive to take narration in their hands. I suppose as a first run it wasn't bad, considering that we are more used to "traditional" RPGs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have another question, related to a fighting conflict in the last session. Five PCs were fighting a single creature. I had each of them roll their Warrior die (some could use Abilities, too) except one rolled a Sorcerer die. As for NPCs, I took the largest of the scores, and based on it the winner narrated the outcome. Now, when it was the NPC's turn to achieve its intent, it chose to inflict one injury to one of the PCs, who however at the same time had chosen to suffer a penalty to get rid of an injury, otherwise he would have died. In essence, suffering the penalty "canceled" the new inflicted injury. Did I rule correctly? If not, which of the two should be applied first?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344287/#Comment_344287" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-28T16:42:17+00:00" title="September 28, 2011  4:42PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glad to hear it went well!<br><br>That sounds like a pretty complicated situation. It sounds like you handled it right. The injury goes away as soon as the penalty is applied - at the moment you roll the die. In general, I like to interpret the rules in the favour of PCs in any case.<br><br>Five PCs is a pretty big number, and I'm glad to hear the game worked well despite that. I usually play with 1-3 players (plus GM), and have had mixed experiences with more than that.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
