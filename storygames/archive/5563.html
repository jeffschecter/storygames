What are good ratios that you've found in play (e.g. Adventurer refreshes 5 Token per Zone and Opposition refreshes 2 each; 10 versus 3; etc)?<br/>2.1) Do you find the game better if it is more lethal, like "traditional" roguelikes? Put differently, is it "OK" for the game to kill an Adventurer in, say, five time the amount of time it took to setup the World, Home, and Adventurer (e.g. 10 minutes of setup yielding "only" an hour-long game)?<br/>2.2) Should I explain how to drift the ratio away from highly lethal to more easily successful? (Basically, a chart of starting and refresh Token counts.)<br/>2.3) Should the core rules actually ramp up that ratio? For example: the Refresh starts at Ad5 and Opps1, but the Ad's reduces by 1 (minimum of 1) every time that he or she returns Home?<br/>3) What didn't you "get" or what was the one most difficult aspect of play based on the rules as written?<br/><br/>Thanks, all--especially Vincent (Trait dice), Eric (freeform location instantiation), and Mike/Ralph (Tokens for Tenets)!<br/>David                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126479/#Comment_126479" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T10:00:57+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 10:00AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2008 12:12PM by David Artman.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, so I got some fast-and-loose feedback from a friend and I'd like to see what folks think:<br/><br/>1) The use of Home seems "wrong" to him, as it's the only place to actually "level up": increase a Trait or Gear higher than the highest T/G on the Adventurer's sheet. Friend points out that the tradition is to level whenever it happens (i.e. no "return home to train") and that eventually the best Gear is in the "dungeon," not back in "town." So...<br/>* I am thinking of flipping the mode and making Home Traits and Gear limited to, say, d8s or d10s. Conversely, there's no limit on what could be created or upgraded during Zone Exploration.<br/>* So, to make returning to Home relevant, I am considering a way for the Adventurer to define (loosely? tightly?) Quests: special "Zones" that they can go to and which, if completed, are worth a few extra Tokens. (Mechanics to follow--it's all a matter of Token economy balance, in the end).<br/><br/>2) Not everything in a roguelike is quantifiable (i.e. representable by various die types). Thus, I need some means to cost and balance "one-off" items (ex: Scroll of Recall, which takes you straight to town or straight back to the last place you use one, if in town).<br/>* There's some (small, hopefully) list of effects that don't fit scaling by die type: they do their thing or they don't. How long is that list, and can I just make Token costs for each general effect and be done with it? (Seems inelegant.)<br/>* Almost any other "one-off bonus or buff" one can imagine in the tradition of roguelikes is just color for Stunts already in <i>RDH</i>: pay Token for a single die use, at half Gear price (i.e. cheap). However, SOME effects are "paired-off" relationships between the Adventurer and Obsticles....<br/><br/>3) We think some kind of "vulnerable to FOO" thing should be usable--but that's a lot like the "one-off" above, in terms of costing. If I want to make some Gear (or even a Talent) "FOO-bane" and then instantiate FOOs into a Zone, that should all have a Token cost.<br/>* Now, given that any roll of 4+ means a success die (and 1 always means a failure die), there is little need for any FOO bonus to be greater than +2. So maybe the Token economy can handle that as straight Tokens spent, like a Stunt.<br/>* But even with that simple solution, there needs to be a "persistence" to the FOO-bane, so it "sticks" to the Gear and can later be pinged. I'm a bit waffly on this one, I admit... It's hard to mix a scalable economy (the dice) with a flat one (one-offs and special vulnerabilities and capabilities to affect said vulnerabilities).<br/>* Plus, there's the whole lock-and-key thing, which could be a form of highly-particular FOO-bane (specific key) and FOO (specific lock). Part of me thinks this aspect of the tradition is pointless: any Opposition-defined "locked door" is but a number of Adventurer Tokens and Exploration away from "finding" the right key; in short, it's sort of trivial to bypass a simple lock-and-key. ONLY IF the Opposition is able to catch the Adventurer with his or her pants down (i.e  no Tokens) could a lock really prevent forward progress. But THAT means the Adventurer would have to go to a different (new or repopulated) Zone and defeat Opposition to get more Coins, to then "find" the right key. Hmmm.... maybe that's all-good...?<br/><br/>4) Encumbrance is also missing--at the least, there should be a sort of "inventory slot" that limits the number of Gear the Adventurer may carry. This makes a reason to go back to Home, too: that's where the Token can be "refunded" (at a slight loss, say 75% of original price) for obsolete or unwanted Gear<br/>* Or that Gear could be stored in a "bank" or equivalent<br/><br/>Anyone else have ideas for how to cost the above; or any notion of other "holes" in <i>RDH</i> that are part of the roguelike tradition?<br/><br/>Thanks;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126481/#Comment_126481" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-14T10:03:14+00:00" title="February 14, 2008 10:03AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn, forgot: I'm also seeking an official  name for the game.

I only reference "Hack" because of my use of on-the-fly Zone creation, rather than pre-planned maps/situations.<br/>----<br/>Think I need the exclamation mark?<br/>ASCII <a href="/forums/profile/HACK">@HACK</a>!<br/>ASCII <a href="/forums/profile/HACK">@HACK</a><br/>----<br/>As for "Will Work For Feedback":<br/><br/>Most of my first post is a request for ANY kind of feedback (yeah, I know; fart in hurricane); but <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> focuses on individual preferences (yeah, a poll)--one needn't have any notion of how <i>RDH</i> plays to give that sort of feedback. Of course, one must care....<br/><br/>1 and 4 in my second post are basically decided. If left to my own devices, I <i>will</i> eventually make a system decision; I was hoping for a bit of expansion or sounding-off from others with roguelike experience, though.<br/><br/>As for 2 and 3 in my second post, I suppose I could break them into several threads, which might get their length below the "aw fuck it" post-length that Teh Intertubez just can't process. I do not, however, have any idea of how to ask those questions while presuming that no one's read the current rules. For instance:<br/><br/><i>How should I do one-off items, given that the Token economy of the system is designed to give a qualitative "rank" to persistent things that are bought with Token?</i><br/>I guarantee you that my first, oh, four replies will be variations on "in my game I..." or "I'd have to know more about your system to...". The former can be somewhat useful--I get to head out and read someone's full rule set, to see (a) if I can parallel my economy with whatever they have to "rate" elements and (b) it actually works (i.e. isn't itself broken). Fair enough, I suppose: I'm the one seeking help; I can shoulder the burden to read. But a lot of time when I see things going that way for other folks, it's a dead end. As for this one:<br/><br/><i>How can I do modifiers that adjust efficacy of elements based on some condition or vulnerability?</i><br/>There's no way in hell to answer that question without knowing the cost of elements in Tokens, how that cost ramps up, the fact that a 4+ roll is a success (and all 1 rolls are failures, reducing the success count), and what the reward cycle does to inject new Tokens. And that list of stuff I just wrote, there is 90% of the rules (rules which, by the way, print on 8 pages at 12 points with HUGE margins--I just checked).<br/><br/>I dunno... I guess it just feel more like a Cult of Personality problem, not a post- or rules-length problem. For whatever reason, I do not warrant enough attention for folks to read eight pages and answer two or three questions (even as I see others warrant the reading of scores of pages and receive feedback across several threads). And, of course, pointing out this impression of mine will only serve to exacerbate the problem, if that's what's going on: no one like even the hint of a whiff of a suggestion that they are cliquish or practice favoritism. (New Thread Idea: "Indie RPG Publishing Success: It's Not Who You Know; It's Who Knows YOU")<br/><br/>Ah, well... whatever. I'll work some more alone and (hopefully) persuade some street bums to playtest it for sandwiches, and finish it as I see fit. THEN, once it's published, I can enjoy a flood of threads from folks who will tell me all about how "its economy is broken in Situations A, X, and Omnicron, especially if you're using the Graphic Tileset Expansion!
