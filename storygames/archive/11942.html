Instead of having people submit games in advance, then having players bite their nails in anticipation until we let them sign-up, we're trying a more fluid, rolling sign-up process:<br/><br/>- We'll have a forum where people can post games for specific time slots, whenever they want.<br/><br/>- Interested players can sign-up or ask questions in those threads, also whenever they want.<br/><br/>No waiting period to sign-up. No partial grid of games that looks (deceptively) like it's all the games that are going to be played at the event. That "false scarcity" problem was a big concern: a lot of what actually gets played at GPNW are pickup games that aren't on the schedule at all (somewhere between 30-50%, by my estimates), so the sign-up opening day schedule really gave the wrong impression.<br/><br/>There'll also be a brainstorming area where you can kick around ideas for things you might run without committing to a slot, see what interest there is, or request games you really want to try but don't know well enough to run -- someone might get inspired and run the game you wanted to try.<br/><br/>Overall, more of a dialog.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266742/#Comment_266742" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T14:17:52+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  2:17PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rereading the GPNW '09 postmortem thread recently, I noticed that there was a real push for "limited signups"--ie not just counting on pickup games to occur at con time, but actually putting a limit on the number of slots a given player could grab in advance, to help minimize clique-building and make sure that nobody regretted filling up their entire schedule after the fact.<br/><br/>I'm not necessarily promulgating this rule myself (I <i>like</i> my clique), but I'm interested to know whether there will be any kind of attempt to put it into play, either strictly or on an honor-system basis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266744/#Comment_266744" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T14:24:18+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  2:24PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think we're going to tell anyone what to do.

I am just reiterating my preferences as I probably stated them in the aforementioned postmortem thread, but I still vastly prefer just showing up and knowing there will be games -- over showing up and noticing that all the really awesome games I would have wanted to sign up for are in fact already full, and were full within minutes of their being posted online. Which is what happened last time. Of course there were still lots of awesome pick-up games -- but I can't help but suggest that many of those games consisted primarily of people like myself who had assumed that the event was going to be operating on the same principle as previous years. Now that it is more widely understood that pre-registration is happening, I can't help but feel like the percentage of pick-up games is going to drop even further this year. I'll probably cave in and check the forums for games to sign up on, for example, though I fully expect to be scooped by people who are scanning them more regularly than I will.<br/><br/>It's not that I think anyone is going to end up without a game, but it does seem like the whole 'last minute Find-A-Game roundup' is getting more and more like a 'here's some leftovers' thing and further and further from a 'here's the basic organizing principle of our con' -- as it was in the first two years. Last year the pickup games were often good, but they also often had a bit of a desperation vibe in terms of getting people matched up and playing.<br/><br/>Obviously I understand there are good reasons for advanced sign-ups. But I still prefer the year two organization, which I remember as a mix of very informal pre-reg (like a tiny percentage of game slots) and everything else happening on-site once people showed up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ping" title="ping"><img alt="ping" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/41dd9b29bf2b05c9bd9b60bb5a720410?s=32&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D32&amp;r=G"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ping">ping</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266762/#Comment_266762" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T15:30:38+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  3:30PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2010 5:17PM by ping.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite> But I still prefer the year two organization, which I remember as a mix of very informal pre-reg (like a tiny percentage of game slots) and everything else happening on-site once people showed up.</blockquote>\nYep, GPNW <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> (2008) was a hybrid of pre-submitted games and pick-up games in response to complaints from 2007 that sorting it all out on the day left people out.<br/><br/>The point being, there is no perfect system. From Day 1, everyone has had different needs as a player or facilitator. We think the best thing to do for all of us is to support the fact that we're a community capable of having a dialog.<br/><br/>I actually think this new way will engender a stronger pick-up game culture. If we actively dispel the illusion created with pre-listings and sign-up day that the "cool, hawt" games have already been filled, more people will know logistically and, more importantly, feel confident that pick-up games are a huge part of GPNW. Hopefully, everyone will step up in their own way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266765/#Comment_266765" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T15:37:42+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  3:37PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for clarifying, guys!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266766/#Comment_266766" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T15:39:16+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  3:39PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2010 3:40PM by philaros.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edit: Oops, sorry for the unintentional dogpile.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>I still vastly prefer just showing up and knowing there will be games -- over showing up and noticing that all the really awesome games I would have wanted to sign up for are in fact already full, and were full within minutes of their being posted online.</blockquote>\nActually Daniel, this also happened at the first GPNW, with the difference being the games were being organized on the spot on whiteboards, and people who got back a couple minutes later from lunch, for example, than most of the group were discovering the same thing: all the "really awesome" games they would have wanted to sign up for were already full. That's what spurred us to try a more organized sign-up approach through the wiki for GPNW 2008, which actually worked the same way as sign-up did last year, and like last year it was about an even split between pre-scheduled games and pick-up games. <br/><br/>I think it's important to emphasize too that all we're seeking to do is facilitate the self-organized games: as the con organizers, we are not trying to force a commitment by anyone to run or play in the games they discuss in advance online. I recognize that's a bit disingenuous, since if someone offers in advance to run a game and has several people sign up, that GM is probably going to follow through and run the game, not decide at the event to go play in someone else's game. But my point is, we're just providing the people who want to make plans in advance a way to do that, while those who want to show up and decide on the spot can and will still do that as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266773/#Comment_266773" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T16:12:43+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  4:12PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: philaros</cite>But my point is, we're just providing the people who want to make plans in advance a way to do that, while those who want to show up and decide on the spot can and will still do that as well.</blockquote>\nWell of course, but it is pretty disingenuous to suggest that the con organizers and the con website supporting advance planning is not going to increase the amount of advanced planning. You are sanctioning the activity, and promoting it, so obviously there will be more of it.<br/><br/>I guess my perception of 2008 as a player is that it was very different from 2009, even though the mechanism may have been theoretically the same. The great thing about 2008 vs. the first year was that the whole grid was laid out in advanced in a nice organized fashion -- it was much easier for everyone to figure out how to sign up, how to post games, etc. compared to the charming first-year free for all.<br/><br/>As far as 'the same thing' happening, with people at lunch or whatever, sure, I guess, but there seems to me to be a qualitative difference between expecting con-goers to be paying close attention to game signup during the con and expecting con-goers to be doing the same thing for a month-long continuous period leading up to the con. With staggered posting times, someone is not going to accidentally miss every game they want -- which is certainly an advantage of this year's method over last year. But I guess it also seems kind of perverse to encourage a situation where someone who wants to make sure they get into potentially 'must-play' games has to camp web forums more or less nonstop for the entire sign-up period, because there are no official (or so far, unofficial) limitations or structure on the online signup.<br/><br/>I think I suggested this before, but unofficially I think it would be great if GMs would simply only pre-book half the slots in their games. But who knows, maybe that's a half-assed solution. I am just wary of the possibility that the con will devolve into a two-track program (which it often felt like last year, though it loosened up by the last day) where the online-active people had one set of games and the just-showed-up people had another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266774/#Comment_266774" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-12T16:16:20+00:00" title="April 12, 2010  4:16PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm just gonna come with some things to run, hoping to get into or organize stuff to play, abstaining from the whole registration process, so I don't think you need to worry overly much, Dan.
