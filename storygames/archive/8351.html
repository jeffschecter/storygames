The setting's great. Actually, OK, maybe that's the only thing, but I do love the setting. Perhaps the Disciplines, too, and the Flaws. the system is bloody awful and the text is even worse. Everything explained in the wrong order, rules upon rules upon rules.<br/><br/>Moreover, I've no idea what an adventure would look like. I've no desire to do a railroaded "The Prince wants you to investigate this thing" adventure. I'd love to do an open-ended thing, where everyone has goals and they fight for the city.<br/><br/>What can I do? I'd like to run this. I'd quite like to run it using the original system, although perhaps a minimal version of it. What I'm after, I think, is some tweaks to the original system.

I've already limited the field so that there's not too much overload for new players (the campaign will focus on The Invictus, with some Circle of the Crone), and I've thought of some ways to pull the players into the game (specifically, I want one player to take on the role of an elder vampire who has been alive for hundreds of years, and another to take on the role of a brand new vampire; the rest will fall somewhere in between: I want to try to explore the themes of hanging on to the mortal world vs being entirely out of it altogether).<br/><br/>As for situations, though, yeah, I keep drifting back to stuff from what I used to see when I played VtM:<br/><br/>* The prince tells you to fetch something. From another clan.<br/>* The Sabbat (Brothers of Belial, in VtR) show up and go wild, and Must Be Stopped.<br/>* Werewolves show up, and Must Be Stopped.<br/>* Vampire hunters are on to you, and Must Be Stopped.<br/><br/>However, yeah it feels really trite. I'm looking for something more "VtR-y" to start things off, but I don't want it to be boring as all heck. I want to pull in some of the politics, but I really can't get a good idea at this point of how the Covenants come into conflict other than:<br/>* snubbing each other in iambic pentameter, or<br/>* going to brutal war in the shadows until All Others Fall<br/><br/>I can't think of anything in between at this point. I'm down with combat in the game, I'm down with social manipulation in the game, I'm down with mystery and problem-solving, but I'm trying to figure out how to take it all and begin.<br/><br/>What I'll probably need to do is start a thread on RPGNet and the WoD forums, asking people to summarize like the Very Beginning of their campaigns, to troll for better ideas than "the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">barkeep</span> <b>prince</b> tells you to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">kill some orcs</span> <b>capture the scroll from the Brothers of Belial</b>".<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184559/#Comment_184559" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T16:59:45+00:00" title="December 21, 2008  4:59PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>What I'm after, I think, is some tweaks to the original system. Any ideas?</blockquote>\nOh yeah, I've already started thinking about that. In the end, I think I can still totally have fun playing it with the original rules, with some minor tweaks. <br/><br/>I don't mind the rules as they stand, they seem pretty ok (to the point that I don't see the need to slim anything down). Contrast to L5R, where after the first session I basically edited the system to be a mashup of 6 better games, and combat was still ridiculously boring (L5R combat: stand toe to toe rolling dice until one falls; I had just started playing D&amp;D 4e at that point, and non-strategic combat just seemed like a mouthful of ash after eating french pastries all day).<br/><br/>If anything, I'd graft on a butt-simple Freind DiceFanmail/Coolness mechanic: Throw in 5x(number of players) worth of red glass beads in the middle of the table at the beginning of the session. If someone does/says/acts something cool, push them a bead. Later (and only later) they can be used to roll an extra d10, no cap.<br/><br/>That's honestly all I'd need to 'fix' at this point, and it's really more like a houserule. I'd need to play it tho to see how those first 1-2 sessions went of course.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184561/#Comment_184561" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T17:49:14+00:00" title="December 21, 2008  5:49PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, a couple more things that were on my mind:<br/><br/>I've got some ideas for "personal" situation, basically stuff that will be tied to each character depending on their age and the like (I thought up some situations for older vampires, new vampires, some in-between vampires, etc). The only thing is that after that, I like to have, y'know, the overarching plot that brings players together in some significant way, even if it focuses on one of the PCs. That latter piece is what I'm having a problem with I think.<br/><br/>Also, another hack I thought up before but forgot to mention: In all my games, no one ever wanted to be the Nosferatu. Cause they're ugly. Yeah, they are powerful and invisible and all that, but in a world of beautiful undead things being beautiful, they're butt-ugly, and playing them... well, I've never seen it happen other than one-shots and the like.<br/>So I figured, if nothing else, "You get 6 free dots. Put them into Anything You Want". Crank up the badass on them, which will both make them more enticing to play, as well as giving a better impression that they're not to be trifled with; that they have far more resources than you would think.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184562/#Comment_184562" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T18:25:46+00:00" title="December 21, 2008  6:25PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a Vampire adventure, you need PCs that have goals and relationships, and you need some interesting NPCs.<br/><br/>Either the PCs have things they want, or they just want to hole up in their HQ and ignore the other mean vampires. In the latter case, you need to threaten their HQ. Like the city starts planning to demolish their Haven. So they need to go out and Do Things. They can manipulate humans or ask other vampires for favors, and if they manipulate the wrong humans, they piss off a vampire.<br/><br/>Another vampire who is asked for a favor or is pissed off will then ask the PCs to do him a favor, in return. This should be something fairly outrageous, and should lead to yet another vampire asking them for a favor. The PCs go round and round until they get pissed off and start wailing on somebody. Have that vampire cave almost immediately, and the PCs will realize they have to beat on people to get what they want, sometimes. 'Cause they're vampires, too, right? Just make sure the PCs aren't the weakest characters in the game, like if you were playing the old Chicago by Night or something. Being the middle man on the pole is much preferable to being low man.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184563/#Comment_184563" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T19:01:52+00:00" title="December 21, 2008  7:01PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham, <br/><br/>I say this in all seriousness, knowing how much it sucks to ask for advice and be told to buy another book -- but many of the things you're talking about are dealt with in fine, in specific, and with varying degrees of skill in the Requiem Chronicler's Guide. <br/><br/>There is a minimalist version of the system written by Sorenson, that's quite like Vampire the Storygame.

First I let them be however old they wanted.  One of the players was a regent (basically a sub prince of part of the city) as well as being the Prince's Templar (legbreaker, it was a Lancea Sanctum city) ,  and one of her children, we just figured the points based on his age. The others were fairly new (5 to 10 years).  I also asked that they all have some significant connection to a mortal.  We played very strongly with the notion that Vampires embrance mostly because they fall in love with a mortal, or they really, really need that person for something. It did make the parent/child relationship very interesting. Then we basically created kickers for each person as well as establishing the general backstory.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as I remember it we had a Vampire kung fu monk from Taipei, relatively new,  who's particular order is always guided by a vampire.  It was time for the master to "walk the earth" and pass the guardianship of the order to his apprentice.  The character was actually the second apprentice as the first had run away, so the master was a bit desperate.  The problem was the character had fallen in love with a mortal woman, and was thinking of abandoning the order.  The second problem was that his father had died suddenly and unexpectedly left everything to him above his siblings or stepmother.  The whole filal piety thing. This is why he was in the (American) city was to look at that end of the business.  His stepmother was also connected to the triads.  (The father dying and leaving him the stuff was the kicker.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a young woman vampire who, after dumping her sire, returned to the city and basically wanted to keep watch over her younger sister and her family.  The kicker being that her sire showed up back in town and wanted her back.  She belonged to the main revolutionary faction in the city as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there was the Templar, one of the princes children, who still had an on/off relationship with the prince herself (a sort of vampiric Joan of Arc, in that she heard voices.)  In additon to his general responsiblities to her he had managed to raise an orphan girl basically to adulthood (I think she was 17, he was about 200 or 300) in secret.  His kicker was that his 'daughter' declared she was in love with him and wanted to be made into a vampire.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe general background was unrest and potential revolution against the Lancea Sanctum who ran the city, mainly because they were extremely strict about the religious traditions of the Lancea and the prince seemed to be getting less and less mentally stable.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd hilarity ensued.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184566/#Comment_184566" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-21T23:16:23+00:00" title="December 21, 2008 11:16PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2008 11:18PM by JDCorley.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite><br>I say this in all seriousness, knowing how much it sucks to ask for advice and be told to buy another book -- but many of the things you're talking about are dealt with in fine, in specific, and with varying degrees of skill in the Requiem Chronicler's Guide.</br></blockquote>\nIn all seriousness, this advice sucks, and it is absolutely completely right in every possible way.

Some hopefully helpful relationship map stuff later in the thread...<br><br>But srsly, it's like saying "GURPS, I don't understand why I can't just sit down, have people make characters and run an adventure!" You can't, there's no there there. <br><br/>Here are some questions that might help. I assume many of them you won't have even thought of. Until you answer them you will never have any success with the game:<br/><br/>- What is bad about the system in your view?<br/>- Also, do you have the main World of Darkness book? You sort of need it, most of the actual systems are described in there (and much more succinctly, I might add).<br/>- What is cool about the setting in your view?<br/>- What do you want PCs to be doing in your game?<br/>- Why will they be doing it (in general)?<br/>- Design a PC that would be dynamite for your game! Why did you make those choices?<br/>- Think through a potential conflict for your game that you think would be badass. What about that conflict makes it badass? Where in that conflict do the PCs interact with the system and how do they do it?<br/><br/>Basically, you must design a campaign before you know what parts of the book you will use and what parts you will junk. So the setting is compelling. Too bad, there's far too much of it to learn in even a Very Serious And Long Campaign. That means working out where your spotlight will shine and that means working out what your game is about.<br/><br/>You have in your hand a fucking great toolkit for making Vampire campaigns. I actually have been designing one with very specific goals in mind recently and it's different from a lot of others. I want to:<br/><br/>- introduce new players who have never played before to the system gracefully. <br/>- introduce new players who have never played before to the setting gracefully.  <br/>- make them feel cool when they do wacky action horror shit. <br/>- give them the creeping dreads as everywhere they turn someone has an agenda they're not telling (not all hostile to the player characters, but always with some secret goal)<br/>- give them clear opportunities to do things<br/>- give them clear choices and benefits to each, mostly political choices, but perhaps a few personal choices too, nothing too intense though<br/><br/>I'll post up the techniques I'm using and where you can find them in the book probably tomorrow or sometime this week. But making a list like this will help a lot.<br/><br/>And finally:<br/><br/>One reason the "Prince gives you a mission" scenario works so well is because damn near everyone hates the Prince and someone is scheming to bring them down and failing your mission and framing some other poor schlub for your failure can often bring you badass rewards from the Prince's dire enemies just as much as succeeding in the mission will bring you from the Prince.  And if you don't want to or can't delve past the surface, the scenario still works because you have a mission and a clear idea of what you're doing and if you're succeeding or not. Once you have a game designed, the scenario is remarkably freeing. "The Prince wants us to steal this occult artifact? Well, fuck him, we're going to destroy it and blame this loyal underling of the Prince, who will be murdered for it, and in return, the guy who hates the fucking Prince will back us and think we're awesome. Oh shit we're being blackmailed! Best get some dirt on him too..." And you've got something going.<br/><br/>This is a great game, it has been a great game since 1991. (It is also largely the same game as it was in 1991.  White Wolf never fucked it up. Think how hard that is to do.)

Hence, I present to you my freshly minted house rules for handling social conflict. All the cool kids are adding combat-like rules for social interaction to their games nowadays, why shouldn't a game like Vampire (that so desperately needs it) get the same treatment?<br/><br/><b>Stage One: Intent</b><br/>The attacker declares what he wishes to gain from social conflict. Whether he wishes to convince the bouncer to let him through or coax information from a prisoner, wearing down the opponent\u2019s Resolve will make it happen.<br/><br/><b>Stage Two: Attack</b><br/>Attack rolls use Presence or Manipulation, depending on the approach and an appropriate Social Skill. Intimidation, Persuasion, Socialize and Subterfuge may all change the minds or opinions of others, but other skills like Empathy, Expression and Streetwise are not used this way. The target uses Composure for Armor and the same Social Skill (the one being used to attack) for Defense.<br/><br/><div><b>Example:</b> \u201cStep away from the girl and drop the gun or I will fire!\u201d Cop rolls Presence + Intimidation, minus criminal\u2019s Composure and Intimidation (armor and Defense).</div><br/><br/><b>Stage Three: Resolution</b><br/>Add bonus dice based on equipment used or effect performed, and then subtract penalties for circumstance conditions.<br/><br/><div><b>Example: </b>The cop\u2019s Intimidation gets +2 from his drawn firearm, but -3 from the hostage (the criminal suspects he won\u2019t fire while the girl is in the way).<br/></div><br/>Roll your remaining pool. Once you have accumulated a number of successes equal to your opponent\u2019s (Resolve x 2), the attacker wins his Intent. The defender loses 1 point of Willpower and is forced to behave as the attacker intended for the duration of the scene. Should a person lose all their Willpower in this way, they are completely at the attacker\u2019s mercy. The successful Intent will remain until it contradicts Virtue or Vice, at which point the poor sap can behave freely again.<br/><br/><div><b>Example: </b>\u201cYou drop your gun pig or I\u2019ll plug the girl!\u201d The criminal rolls Presence + Persuasion (+3 for the girl), minus the cop\u2019s Composure and Persuasion. The criminal gets 4 successes. The cop, with a Resolve of 2, is forced to comply and loses 1 Willpower. Now the cop can still act freely (call for backup, tell the girl to run, persuade the criminal to take him as a hostage instead, etc) but the gun must remain dropped for the duration of the scene. The criminal earned it!</div><br/><br/>Social Conflict often happens in turns, with each participant taking opportunity to persuade or win over his opponent. Of course, if some one is noticeably out matched, they may opt to simply walk away. An annoyed character may also cut the discourse short by resorting to violence, in which case Initiative is rolled as normal. These rules are designed to be interchangeable with rules for Combat Resolution. There\u2019s no reason characters in combat can\u2019t spend a round or two doing social attacks (asking for surrender, etc).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184596/#Comment_184596" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-22T09:18:40+00:00" title="December 22, 2008  9:18AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.<br/><br/>Quick question: what happened to all the stuff with Influence, where you could influence the media to do stuff?

While it seems like a Fetch Quest, it's really just some lotion to get a campaign stone wheel rolling down a hill. <br/><br/>I like your questions. Since I'm going through the process like Graham is (albeit probably closer to Go-Time), I'll give my take on the answers to your questions. Kind of a thread sidetrack (I'd like to see Graham's answers as well), but it's better than posting by myself on my LJ:<br/><br/><b>- What is bad about the system in your view?</b><br/><br/>For me, not much. It does what it does. One thing that I've heard some people say (which I've experienced years ago, but not lately) is that it's hard to set difficulties for things, because it seems at any given task the PCs either have TONS of dice in it, or VERY VERY FEW dice. Part of the solution I think is to tailor what you throw at the players, but that's a general RPG discussion of its own right there.<br/><br/>I'm broken in that I love Coolness/Friend Die/Fanmail mechanics, a mechanical reward for doing cool things in-game. It's just plain <i>fun</i> to be rewarded like that. I think grafting something like that onto Vampire/WoD can be done in a small way that doesn't break shit, but that's just me. Other than that and the Nosferatu thing, I think the game is fine as-is, from what I'm reading anyway.<br/><br/><b>- Also, do you have the main World of Darkness book? You sort of need it, most of the actual systems are described in there (and much more succinctly, I might add).</b><br/><br/>Yeppers. 2 copies, actually: One for me, one for The Table. They're really cheap on eBay.<br/><br/><b>- What is cool about the setting in your view?</b><br/><br/>For me: I like a few of the Covenants (Invictus, Dracul, Circle of the Crone). I see the Invictus as "the council of badass evil dudes from the original Blade movie", which is why I especially like them.<br/><br/>I like the idea of people becoming vampires then trying to come to grips with how to live from that point on, which is why I'm so drawn to having both an ancient and young character in the same group/coterie, so that we can see how one person deals with letting their life go (which just ended), and another dealing with living in a new generation. And I'd like an "in-between" as well, maybe a vampire who follows his bloodline, keeps tabs on his/her children/grandchildren.<br/><br/>However, I want to find a good balance. I've been in too many campaigns (admittedly back in the 90s) where it was like:<br/>GM: Yeah, yeah, you're dead, boo hoo. So, you four are now involved in deep Machiavelian scheming for the control of the city.<br/>Player: What about "vampire stuff"? "Personal Horror?"<br/>GM: (throws in a metaplot about having to feed off of children)<br/>GM: OK, now back to our West Wing with Fangs...<br/><br/>I want to hit that balance of "cool political things happening that the characters want to/feel the need to get involved with" and "address personal issues of being a vampire", without going all "95% emo time" in one direction, or "95% west wing" in the other.<br/><br/><b>- What do you want PCs to be doing in your game?</b><br/><br/>I want one to be dealing with having been turned recently, dealing with letting go of his old life and getting used to the bewildering world of vamp society.<br/>I want another to be dealing with going into Topor for a few hundred years, and waking up in the world of Cars and The Internet.<br/>That's what I'd want as a GM. After that, I'd want to see what the players would want out of the game, and play that up.<br/><br/><b>- Why will they be doing it (in general)?</b><br/><br/>Because playing vampire then jumping straight into politics... I can do that with any RPG. I want to have some of that in the backdrop of "being a vampire".<br/><br/><b>- Design a PC that would be dynamite for your game! Why did you make those choices?</b><br/><br/>Stop right there. <b>This is some <span style="color: #FFCC33;">fucking gold</span> right here</b>. In fact, I'm going to make that blink. With sparkles.<br/><br/><b><span style="color: #FFCC33;">fucking gold</span></b><br/><br/>I might even have to carry that through to its own thread. <br/><br/><b>- Think through a potential conflict for your game that you think would be badass. What about that conflict makes it badass? Where in that conflict do the PCs interact with the system and how do they do it?</b><br/><br/>This is pretty cool too. I'll have to think on this for a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_184611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184611/#Comment_184611" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-22T11:14:45+00:00" title="December 22, 2008 11:14AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Hmm.<br/><br/>Quick question: what happened to all the stuff with Influence, where you could influence the media to do stuff?

Vampires can have most of the mortal merits for contacts and influence (in the main WoD rulebook), but the level of "I can make the president come to my ghoul's party" influence form the old Vampire is more or less absent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_184613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/184613/#Comment_184613" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-22T11:16:55+00:00" title="December 22, 2008 11:16AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Quick question: what happened to all the stuff with Influence, where you could influence the media to do stuff?

It's in the main World of Darkness book (with most of the other Merits and Flaws).  <br/><br/>If you want to expand it back out from where it's been simplified there's actually a really awesome mini-game for influence in the Damnation City supplement, involving targetting Assets, which are people and institutions based around each of the Abilities, so you might have a police detective who is an Investigation 3 Asset, and so on. You can then use these Assets to target the Assets of other vampires in various ways - identifying them, tracing who has them, killing them, stealing them, and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
