Is it possible to do an opening monologue well? (I know it's the bane of some players, when done poorly.)<br/><br/>When you monologue, do you tend to do so in character, as a GM, or a mixture? Do you do cool things with your tone and volume to keep attention on your words? Is there a signal (verbal or non) at your table that says "Okay, guys, listen up for a while"? If you feel that a game *needs* a monologue, but you have players with short attention spans, how do you reconcile those two things?<br/><br/>Also, what are some cool monologue tricks? JDCorley, if you read this feel free to link to and talk about your Arrested Development voice-over faulty narrator trickz.<br/><b><br/>In summary: Do you monologue? Well?

The monologue (Imho) should never be so important or necessary that the story can't go on without it , and if the players are interrupting its a pretty clear sign that the monologue is either too long or badly placed. <br/>\n<br/>\nThings I try to do with the monologue.

We added it as a part of the game - and we tied it to the Refreshment-rules (sort of like healing-scenes, if you don't know TSoY - and if you don't shame on you). So whenever a player wants to do a refreshment, he can describe his or her character writing a blog, creating a videolog or whatever - and it is done as a monologue. Afterwards the other players and myself chip in as various commenters on the blog. It is a very popular thing and it is often done even without the need to Refresh, but simply to share the inner life of the character, as the character would express him- or herself in writing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167573/#Comment_167573" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-07T14:22:58+00:00" title="September  7, 2008  2:22PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Morten,<br/><br/>That is highly cool.

If I may paraphrase to ensure that I've sucked every ounce of knowledge from your writing:<br/><br/>If the players work for a monologue, it gives them a chance to invest in what you're saying. Make information a target, and when they get to it they'll be eager for a monologue instead of bored.<br/><br/>When you monologue, don't tell them a bunch of new information. Tell them information which changes things already in motion.<br/><br/><br/>Both of those lessons are good ones for me. Cheers.<br/><br/>On an unrelated note, I just realized why I posted this thread in the first place. I'm playing a young, idealistic lawyer character, and monologuing is critical to my lawyerly success.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167604/#Comment_167604" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-07T17:32:58+00:00" title="September  7, 2008  5:32PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yup, that's exactly it, the monologue wasn't some "okay, put what you want to do next on hold while I tell you some stuff", it was "the stuff you have been working for that you want to know in order to decide what to do next" and yes it was something play had been building towards for a while, that they choose.

I like to play with a lot of atmosphere. I don't use it nearly enough, though. That's why I adore the Swedish game Ber\xe4ttelser fr\xe5n Staden (Stories from the City), written by a friend of mine. In it, play is divided into chapters, and between each chapter, GM role and characters switch owners ("Ooh, I wanna play this dude in this chapter!").<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it's specifically written in the game that each chapter starts with a monologue. It's not just the GM framing the first scene ("Alright, so Johannes is in his room, right? And a tube arrives through the tube mail thingy."), it sets a lot of atmosphere ("The little room is dark and dank, and full different kinds of perfumes. Jasmine and Hyacinth leaks from the tiny bottles that Johannes the perfumer uses in his trade ..."). I've never had any trouble with players finding this boring. It's probably because they're all listening for interesting ways to get their newly chosen roles into the action. When the monologue starts, the stage is set, and everyone can start going "I burst in, sweaty and filthy. 'Johannes! You'll never guess what's happened!'".<br/>\n<br/>\nDunno if this was useful, but there you go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167640/#Comment_167640" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-08T01:12:36+00:00" title="September  8, 2008  1:12AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2008 1:12AM by JDCorley.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually tend to not have any problems signalling or doing monologuing (as a GM or a player, much to the chagrin of certain GMs!) because I have the skill of talking in such a way as to get the room quiet and listening - it comes from a lot of practice. <br/><br/>Try doing a big deep intake of breath the next time you want to - that helps.

So what I am saying isn't about "how to do it", but rather "what to use it for".<br/><br/>Anyway, I ran a game loosely set in the Night Watch world, of which only I had read the books (one other watched the movie, and the other two quickly picked up on how things worked).<br/><br/>Instead of front-loading all of the knowledge about the world (although I did a little bit, to get people on the same page). I'd do something that came out, basically, like I was reading the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy entry for that element.<br/><br/>For example, someone was like "I look at him in The Gloom, do I see anything?"<br/><br/>To which I would say:<br/>"Well, as you are aware, the Gloom will not reveal the true nature of a person's powers. For example, if they were a vampire or a werewolf, you wouldn't be able to tell that without using deeper scrying magic. However, everyone's "auras" can be read in the Gloom to see if they are basically light or dark or neutral.<br/><br/>When you look at THIS guy, you see that he falls on the dark side, but not too deep. You suspect that he's just a grunt."<br/><br/>The first part being a monologue to introduce new information about the setting, or to re-introduce information that might have been forgotten.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
