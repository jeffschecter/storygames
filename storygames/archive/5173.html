Wrong start. I have a gaming idea. But I need to settle on a suitable system - and would like to ask for your help with ideas and input.<br/>\nThe short version: I'd love to play a Kirbyesque weird/pulp fantasy game inspired partly by Kirby's Kamandi, partly by his New Gods-epos. I envision a post-apocalyptic wasteland where animals have grown big and strange, some have evolved to new manlike species (imagine a big man with a rhino-head), there are dino-like creatures roaming about and small societies are beginning to grow. The PC's are travellers in these lands ripe with danger. <br/>\nI imagine an episodic feel with a new "town" or conflict/stakes every adventure. The feel should be heroic but the game should also move in a moral grey area (not a sharp black/white moralism), hard choices should be plentiful and so should exciting combat.<br/>\nThe system should support easy but interesting conflicts of all kinds (social, physical, combat, whatever) and also make it easy and exciting for everyone involved to co-create. The background of the world should be sketchy at the outset and then evolve through play. Players should be rewarded for being creative and daring. And it should be a breeze to GM - quick to prepare and easy to run. <br/>\nOK - now for the big question: I need a system. But which one? At first, I thought of TSOY, but even though it has a LOT of the features, I seek I think I'd like more system-crunch that allows the players to create on the fly. Would SOTC be a good choice? I regret to say that even though it's sitting on my shelf (mocking me!) I have yet to read it. BW could be possible, but since I'm running a campaign of that at the moment I'd like to try my hand at something else.<br/>\nSorcerer and Sword doesn't feel right for this, I think - the stories in this game wouldn't all centre around dysfuntional relationships so...<br/>\nPTA is too loose - I'd need more crunchy conflict systems.<br/>\nLadies and gentlemen of Story Games - do you have any great suggestions?<br/>\nBest <br/>\nPeter                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116790/#Comment_116790" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-28T08:33:23+00:00" title="December 28, 2007  8:33AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 28, 2007 8:33AM by Ry.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you going to have a really consistent player base or are people going to be dropping in and out?<br/>(Edit: Any details on your group would probably help)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116798/#Comment_116798" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-28T09:05:49+00:00" title="December 28, 2007  9:05AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Forgive me for straying "off the reservation," but why not HERO System?

There's nothing to defeat in the HERO system, no victory or loss conditions that require a strategy to overcome. It's all about exploring the setting, and building almost any character to optimize that exploration, whether it's being created by players or fed to them. But if you honestly think HERO has a Gamist or Narrative potential, I'd love to hear your ideas in another thread, since I don't think pedyo really cares too much about what theory elements it supports <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I echo the suggestions for tSoY, SotC, and HeroQuest.<br/><br/>I think you are overestimating the crunch of tSoY. There's a lot of components, but they are really just examples of Keys and Secrets you can make. The system outside of those is very simple. HeroQuest is a little simpler, unless you're trying to work in different types of magic (the various magic approaches can be hard to wrap your brain around at first). But very similar in the core mechanic of simple and extended contests to regular conflict and Bringing Down the Pain in tSoY. HeroQuest, though, gives the players a lot of power for narrative influence, comparable to SotC.<br/><br/>SotC is definitely more complex, in my book, than these two. But it's easier to get the hang of than HeroQuest, and to a lesser degree, tSoY. The complex potential of stunts far outweighs tSoY's Secrets and Keys.<br/><br/>SotC is best if you want lots of play in every conflict, and let the players focus on being awesome instead of becoming awesome. tSoY would do you better if you want to gloss over conflicts in general, but let players hone in on (by Bringing Down the Pain) conflicts they feel is important. HeroQuest is great if you want a wide sweeping story and lots of potential in the power scale, and more control over which conflicts to gloss over and which to make important.<br/><br/>I'd also suggest Dogs in the Vineyard, if you want the "towns"/episodic conflict to be highlighted, as well as giving players the power to make hard choices without a moral backing, though it could lead them to question the nature of their own heroism, which you may not want. You'd have to tweak the sins for something less oriented to Dogs and more towards the pulp fantasy problems, but it's good if you want them to face villains and evil that have human origins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_117593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pedyo" title="pedyo"><img alt="pedyo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pedyo">pedyo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117593/#Comment_117593" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-02T23:43:03+00:00" title="January  2, 2008 11:43PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, tell me about HeroQuest.

However, the bonus to that is it gives you a nice base for taking it in a new direction by developing new Keywords (more on that). There's a generic system coming out that will make this process plainer (I can only hope). The only stumbling block I faced is that HeroQuest-Glorantha has three different magic systems. In retrospect, this is great as it gives more insight on how you might want to alter the system to fit a different genre. When first facing it, it's daunting and confusing and it took me several reads and a few short times playing it to figure out what it all meant. I think most of that has to do with the way it's presented. It's prestented as "Here's how you learn this type of magic in Glorantha" not "Here's how this magic system works"<br/><br/>As you probably no, the first thing is Keywords.  These define Homeland and Occupation, and are a catch-all set of skills, personality traits, relationships, etc that define what a character should be able to do without screwing them over because they missed something. Like all Sailors know how to Tie Knots. Whether you wrote it down or not, you know how to tie knots at your Keyword rating.<br/><br/>Glorantha uses a this Keyword called Magic.  However, this can be altered to better fit whatever setting. Since every person in Glorantha knows a little bit of magic, it works. A better catch all Keyword I've seen is a Personal keyword. This is basically "stuff that defines your character in an important way that's not part of the other two keywords".  I've used this to get specific, like giving a Personal Keyword of Pirate to a Sailor. And I've used it to simply add variety, like using it to allow a scholar to have martial arts and other skills. As long as it makes sense for the character, anything goes under here. I find it best to set a limit, like 8 skills, 4 personality traits, 4 relationships, to prevent abuse.<br/><br/>For my Exalted HeroQuest conversion, I also give PCs three MORE keywords, all of them a different type of powerful magic at hire ratings.  So, in short, you can adjust the number of keywords to whatever you want to fit the game.  Or you can even just remove them entirely and let the players define them all. This lets everyone Play As You Go, and if they decide their homeland is New Grundia, then they get to decide what New Grundia is like by what abilities they chose to list under it.<br/><br/>Each of your abilities has a rating. Each obstacle has a rating. The HQ default is 14 for obstacles. So, a standard wall might have a 14 when trying to climb it. So if you have a 17 in Climb, you have to get a 17 or less on a d20 to succeed. The GM rolls for the wall, and has to get a 14 or less.  Depending on what you both roll, it determines how well you succeed. So say you roll a 7, and the GM a 12. Both are successes, but you got a lower roll, so you win. You make it over, with some difficulty.  In a fight, you'd compare the fighting skills, or maybe fighting vs. running or avoid combat if one person is trying to escape or simply survive, or whatever skills fit. Regardless of whether its a sword fight, climbing a wall, seducing a prince, or baking a cake, the system is the same. The only difference is the abilities you use, so you control the flavor of the narrative based on what abilities you can bring to bear.<br/><br/>One great thing about contests is that they can be set up like stakes. First, losing one is never a life or death question. It can lead to death, but a single bad turn isn't going to do that. But in addition to that, the players and GM can negotiate what it means to win or lose. Does failing to pick this lock mean we can't get into the castle, or does it mean the guards find us just as we get it unlocked? The game encourages you to make sure that failure doesn't mean the end of the road (SotC has better advice on this written in the book, though, but SotC has some of the best advice in a single game I have ever seen).<br/><br/>So, you've got these keywords and abilities.  After that, it works a lot like FATE, with Aspects and Skills blended.  You won't just have fighting, you'll have other things. So, maybe you have a Personality Trait of Determined, and a relationship trait of Loves the Princess.  And maybe you're not just climbing a random wall, but climbing the wall of a fortress to save the Princess.  Well, you can augment your primary skill (Climb in this case) with these other traits. Unlike Fate, these don't cost anything, and in an extremely fitting contest, you might be able to augment several things increasing your ability to very high levels (teamwork works similarly, you can augment your friends to give your group a chance to overcome a particularly powerful foe). Instead of providing a flat bonus, like Fate's +2 (or reroll) they provide a bonus based on a fraction of their rating. So very strong personality traits (or whatever) help out more than minor ones, making their influence on the narrative stronger.<br/><br/>Finally, another cool feature is masteries. You might have noticed that starting at 17, you're going to be above 20 rather quickly, especially if you're augmenting. Going above 20 doesn't mean autosuccess.  Instead, when you reach 21, 20 points are converted into a Mastery, so you have 1M (HQ uses runes that look more like W, but I prefer a non-rune M). So lets say your Climb is augmented to 1M.  You roll a 7, failure, and the wall gets a 12, success.  However, the wall doesn't have a Mastery, so you can use your Mastery to bump your roll.  A failure bumps to a success, so you've succeeded, and with a lower roll, you still win. If you had a 7M, then you would have rolled a success and it would bump to a critical success, making your victory much better.  If you are rolling against a resistence that has a mastery also, they cancel each other out.  And when you get to 21M, 20 again converts and now you're at 1M2, or two masteries, which lets you make your successes even better against that pitiful wall. Masteries let you scale up the conflict to extreme levels with very little additional book keeping.<br/><br/>Well, that was long, but the basics. There are Extended Contests, which work similiar to Bringing Down the Pain in tSoY, changing it from a single roll to a more involved give and take, but you can read up on that in the book.  Mythic Russia, another game using the HeroQuest engine, has some better advice, like chained Simple Contests, which bridge the gap between the two options. HQ and SotC are both great games. <br/><br/>In the coming months I'm actually going to be comparing them more to see which I prefer for pulp fantasy. I know SotC does pulp very well. I know HQ does fantasy very well. I'm not sure which does pulp fantasy better for me, much less to recommend one over the other. SotC does blow by blow, in the moment action well, but falters when it comes to characters growing and becoming more powerful. HQ does sweeping drama and increasingly powerful play extremely well and requires less prep (at least for me), but when you want blow by blow action, you might be left wanting. But they both are great at giving the players power and influence over the story and rewarding creativity. I'd definitely give HQ another look, and give SotC a read.  If you can talk your players into it, heck even just one or two players, try to give them both a test run in some simple scenario and see which one feels right. They're both easy and fast enough that you'll have a good handle on the way play feels with just an hour or two of play. So you could do both in the same gameday.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118051/#Comment_118051" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-05T03:46:07+00:00" title="January  5, 2008  3:46AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2008 1:29AM by Tim_Gray.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just as a pre-plug, one of my current projects is Jaws of the Six Serpents, a little sword-and-sorcery-style fantasy game using PDQ.
