The very fact that they <b>KNOW</b> that Fighter is what they have to deal with can help them to explore that concept more thoroughly, and to find unexpected facets.  What does the Fighter do when he's become a king, and is now in charge of keeping the <i>peace</i>, for instance?  How does Conan, sitting aged but still deadly upon the throne, still embody the virtues of the Fighter?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97533/#Comment_97533" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T11:19:10+00:00" title="September 19, 2007 11:19AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think "my character" should be thrown out the window entirely, but that's just me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97538/#Comment_97538" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T11:30:31+00:00" title="September 19, 2007 11:30AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>The benefits of freedom are in no way an indictment of the benefits of constraint.</blockquote>\nLikewise, the reverse.

For instance, for a Feng Shui game, you might decide on a set of 16, something like this:<br/><br/>Key of Faction<br/>Key of the Traitor<br/>Key of the Outcast<br/>Key of the Independent<br/><br/>Key of the Mission<br/>Key of the Guardian<br/>Key of Vengence<br/>Key of the Impostor<br/><br/>Key of Bloodlust<br/>Key of the Coward<br/>Key of Power<br/>Key of Glittering Gold<br/><br/>Key of Love<br/>Key of Unrequited Love<br/>Key of Fraternity<br/>Key of the Guardian<br/><br/>Now, this group isn't much smaller than the basic TSoY set, but I think the combination of explicit declaration and implicit constraint might have an interesting effect on the game.  Like the set list of Descriptors in Sorcerer, this is in part a set of genre restrictions.  In addition, the set list makes buying off Keys place increasing constraints on the player's actions.  At the beginning the field is quite open, but as the game goes on a player's choices will narrow--and I think it is this combination of opportunity and constraint that really seems productive.  If the players buy in early on, increasing constraint appears as a result of their own actions and is more likely to be productive rather than frustrating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
