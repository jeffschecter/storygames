Math(s) rarely come into play, and if randomness is present it often takes an exceedingly simple form.<br/><br/>By co-operative, I mean games that largely rely upon the active willingness to engage with the other players during play, and to use compromise, honest and quick negotiation, and incorporation of other players' concepts as the primary tools to resolve differing ideas about the game fiction ( perhaps with some sort of randomness or resource use as a fall-back).<br/><br/>Examples of games that I find relevant in some way:<br/>Until we sink..., Archipelago, Best Friends.<br/>Some parlor larps ( A Wodehouse larp called MidSummer Mischief I played in recently)<br/>A bit further away: Matrix Games, Fiasco, Mugger Games<br/><br/>Challenge, Ownership &amp; Authority, Invitation, Trouble-making, Structure/Closure<br/><br/>Ownership and Authority<br/>One common element that I see is that each participant has authority over at least their own character, but often also has an authority position over setting elements to some degree as well. Often, this is established early on with some collective situation and setting creation activity. During play, this carries over into round-robin style scene creation and scene-play.<br/><br/>Interestingly, it seems almost a requirement of co-operative play that players <b>not</b> be limited exclusively to just acting in-character. To function well, players need the option to be able to speak out of character (whether at schedules break times or at any key moment), and the right of particpants to create ( in the moment) apsects of setting or events outside of their character also appears to be nearly essential. It seems equally necessary that this sort of authority be divided up among participants, in  a rather more equitable way than in the traditional GM/Character players arrangement common to table-top rpgs.<br/><br/>Invitation:<br/>While authority and ownership are a key part of play, co-operative play would falter badly without Invitation. Essentially, this is when players engage with one another within their area of authority/ownership, then actively draw in other participants. I think that ownership/ authority is a necessary pre-condition to Invitation. The ability to say "No" becomes the key to being able to say "Yes" much more readily, to take risks with ones areas of authority and the fiction.<br/><br/>Without active invitation by the participants, co-operative play simply falters. Players flail about or turtle up, or simply become dis-engaged from events as scene-framing becomes monologuing or a bit of unconnected fiction simply spoken at the other players.<br/><br/>Challenge<br/>In co-perative play, challenge in the game takes the form of following up on the other participants concepts and integrating them back in to the greater events. Perhaps because of the nature of authority/ownership over non-character only elements of play, there is less reason to focus solely on the achievements of the individual character and more on events as a whole.<br/><br/>Trouble-making<br/>Co-operative play falters if there is a lack of trouble-making, almost as badly as from a lack of invitation. In a very real way, invitation is a prelude to trouble-making. While invitation can take the form of simple in-character interaction, more often the other players invited interact are expected, in some fashion, to provide adversity within the fiction and hopefully of a type not immediately surmountable or obvious to the inviting player. In this context, a well-crafted bit of trouble is a gift to the inviter. It shows that the trouble-maker has a good sense of the other player's area of authority/ownership (usually their character, but not always) and gives them a way to engage in the challenge of incorporation of the trouble into the fiction. In practice, I often prefer to use a bit of randomness at these points to choose between different "forks" in the fiction. Any claims of authority and primary tools are used to help define those possible forks.<br/><br/>Structure and closure<br/>I put this category down as optional but strongly recommended.<br/><br/>The sort of structure that I refer to here is one that encourages events to move forward. Of the games mentioned (IIRC), only Best Friends does not have this element in the design. The mentioned larp has a time frame, marked by a short recess at the close of each hour of real-time representing the end of the days events ( there are four days total). The others tend towards a set number of rounds of play in which each player takes an active role in setting up scenes. The number of rounds is limited, and players are aware of this. This play element tends to strongly discourage wandering to far away from other players in terms of participation. Unlike more open-ended play, participants almost of necessity must bring their play into interaction with that of the others or risk becoming disengaged and their contributions and vision effectively nullified.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>Okay, so that's my overly wordy take on thngs. My interest is in hearing what other folks think about this all, primarily in terms of tools to use to achieve these elements successfully.<br/><br/>Edit: In particular, I'm interested in ways to work in the concepts of Invitation and Trouble-making as actual procedures, rather than implied activities or suggestions.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179758/#Comment_179758" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T10:34:54+00:00" title="November 22, 2008 10:34AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like what you're saying about invitation - very useful concept. Especially what you say (if I'm reading you right) about how, when you've got clear rules about authority, it's much easier to accept and invite input into your story. If I have no way of stopping you if you mess with my story, I'll probably be more reluctant to let you. <br/><br/>My experience with Archipelago, at least, is that when lines of authority are strongly drawn, players need to be more active in inviting each other over, so to speak. <br/><br/>With regards to trouble-making: In cooperative games, sometimes it's fun to make trouble for your own character and let the other players work it out. "Oh no, I seem to have fallen from the zeppelin! How can I possibly survive?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179760/#Comment_179760" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T11:06:16+00:00" title="November 22, 2008 11:06AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think self-trouble making may be yet another form of invitation. I'd originally been thinking in terms of invitation mostly as bringing in other players as characters ( their own or temporary), but in this case I see that as signally the other players that you are relenting on authority and requesting them to jump in and at least temporarily taking up some of that authority.<br/><br/>As a follow up thought, does good troublemaking in a co-operative context alost necessarily tie in to other players' areas of ownership? It strikes me that it should, either directly ( it involves another character or owned element right now) or indirectly ( it will in the near future, perhaps in the next scene or chunk of events).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179783/#Comment_179783" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T15:25:58+00:00" title="November 22, 2008  3:25PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>You seem to be using the term 'structure' in two different ways.</p>\n<p>Near the beginning, you talk about the games being "low-structure".

"Invitation" is actually only another way of saying "offer" (an expression coined by Keith Johnstone in improvisational theory). Clarification: When, in improvisational theatre, you make an "offer" to another actor, you give that actor something to use when playing. An offer like that should never be declined, but taken, used, and elaborated on. I see "invitation" as more or less the same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see the methods of play used in these so-called low structure games as very similar to certain elements of Johnstone's improvisational theory.

It seems like I've seen designs that are pretty good about creating trust between players early in the set-up, but I'm not as sure that I can easily point to examples of methods that encourage that cross-player trust later on in the game ( which seems to be an important precursor to more risk-taking in terms of fictional content).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180015/#Comment_180015" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T09:24:21+00:00" title="November 24, 2008  9:24AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think establishing it early on leads to that behavior becoming part of play throughout the game.

By initiator, I mean the person who usually gets the game and pulls the play group together the first time out. Usually, this one of several "GM duties", but I'm trying to envision what it would look like split off and focussed on specifically, especially in regard to games that don't necessarily have a centralized GM role.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180022/#Comment_180022" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T10:06:53+00:00" title="November 24, 2008 10:06AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2008 10:08AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great point.

It carries no power but some degree of responsibility, and if someone assumes the facilitation duties everything tends to go better.

Something extremely simple even, maybe a single page long and with very little there.<br/><br/>Like, oh, I dunno:<br/><br/><i>When it's your turn to set up a scene, make sure to invite at least one other person in to play another character at some point after you described the initial situation and setting for the scene, and told the rest of the players at least where you want things to start in the scene.<br/><br/>The other player may decline if they wish, but a scene doesn't really work if at least one other player is not involved at some point, so try to volunteer to play when invited.<br/><br/>You can invite more than one player to participate, and may do it at different times during the scene.<br/><br/>At some point in the scene that you're playing, one player or another should try to "make trouble" for the main, spotlighted character involved. If you've started the scene, look for places where trouble could occur and make sure to point them out and invite the other players in to cause trouble if no other player has done so.<br/><br/>When another player has suggested some kind of trouble during your scene, you may accept it and work it in in some fashion. Better yet, you can ask for multiple possible outcomes of the trouble, and either pick one or use a randomizer to choose from the ones offered ( possibly including one of your own).<br/><br/>Usually, you'll want to end a scene after the majority of players, including yourself, have had a chance to participate in it either as a character player or in making trouble for the spotlighted character.</i><br/><br/>So, a bit rough, but that's what I'm imagining. I might even make it more formal still, but the idea is to just help players through the first few scenes or other chunks of story, at which point I think they'll probably have absorbed the core concept and the cheat sheet can be dumped, just as you'd remove the training wheels after a youngster has learned to pedal and steer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180056/#Comment_180056" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-24T11:58:34+00:00" title="November 24, 2008 11:58AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's a good idea and I'm going to do it!

One of the things I liked about Archipelago ( and to some extent Fiasco, too) was having the written stuff visible.

We recently <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=27126.0" rel="nofollow">called it quits</a> on a flailing Sorcerer game, had a talk about it, and realized that as a group (not necessarily individually; I for one am still dying to play Sorcerer), we require a game with different priorities, different social and aesthetic demands, and different structure of play. In short, something very like you're describing.<br/><br/>We're currently reviewing different games and concepts we could try. We mainly determined that our needs were:<br/>A) High shared authorship including Authority extending beyond our characters' skin,<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Low game-mechanical buy-in requirement; in other words not too much futzing around with scores and dice and such,<br/>C) Scenes with every player constantly involved, with a focus on PC interaction and conflict,<br/>D) Due to scheduling difficulties-in other words, the game doesn't break down if one person doesn't show one week,<br/>E) Low prep responsibility, for the same reason as D).<br/><br/>Let me see if I can't tease out some instructive observations in light of your parameters:<br/><br/><b>Ownership and Authority</b><br/>Authority was a constant source of friction in our game, sometimes minor, sometimes more. While I believe Sorcerer does allow for Director stance just fine, our group was wont to use an amount and variety of DS that wasn't a good fit with the game. For instance, a player once made up an all-important object, declared it was in the trunk of a random car at the scene of a bombing she was passing by, and went to ridiculous lengths to get it, including stopping her car on the freeway, hopping a divider, facing down armed policemen, and escaping through a drain pipe in the marsh.<br/><br/>Similarly, the vesting of strong Authority in the GM tripped people up. For instance, in that scene, the player stepped on the GM's role by declaring that she sensed through her Demon that there was something in some car. And she was repeatedly befuddled by my narrating the Cops drawing on her, ordering her to halt, chasing her, searching for her, etc. I think if our Narrative powers were more equalized she'd be more at home; my having "Ownership" over so many elements of the fiction was a bit overwhelming and counterintuitive to her, and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/><b>Invitation:</b><br/>We struggled as well with sharing material in several key ways. First, the PCs started out strangers whose paths hadn't crossed. We had a little bit of crossover, but not enough to create satisfying participation for all players, all the time. We also struggled with some particular shared ownership issues and their boundaries, namely Kickers, Demons, and NPCs. There were several Kickers I didn't know what to do with, and so floundered in providing what the player was looking for. And we had some mismatched expectations on how some Demons and supporting characters should function, and their relationships with the PCs. I think a key requirements for "low-structure, cooperative" would be explicit support for all-players, all-the-time participation, and guidance for how to effectively "share" an area of ownership with someone.<br/><br/><b>Challenge</b><br/>This is similar to the above. We were really at sea regarding the incorporation and elaboration of each other's input.<br/><br/>I think our struggle with application of game-mechanics is related to Challenge as well. Finding a supple ruleset and learning to apply it deftly, unobtrusively in the service of your mode of play is a matter of skill and no simple one. We were tripped up as a group by this, finding that these rules with these players at best added nothing and at worst interfered with our aims. The above scene was hampered by this as well as the Authority issues (the two problems going hand in hand, I think). It was like: "I run and hide from the cops and escape." "Wait a minute, there's a roll, then another roll. . ." "Wha. . .?"<br/><br/><b>Trouble-making</b><br/>This is a biggie. Our adversity-providing flopped on several levels, including me not knowing what to do with some Kickers. We also had a hard time "aiming" the PCs at one another; like I said they all began separate and unrelated, and while their paths crossed in due time, it was difficult to figure out what to <i>do</i> when they did. One player noted that he was itching for some juicy PC interaction, but when he actually met another PC, there was nothing there, just a sort of 'Hi, you're weird." "Hi, I'm weird." scene.<br/><br/>To some degree, this is just a roleplaying-maturity issue that can't be helped except by doing and learning. But maybe some  principles can be extracted. Front-loading conflict points would seem to be at least one important technique. Not preplaying, but setting up fictional elements such that they're automatically poised to create and exacerbate dynamic tension between them. Of course, Sorcerer <i>has</i> a strong front-loading element via Kickers, but we still flubbed those. So some degree of skill in aiming conflict-elements <i>well</i> is in order.<br/><br/>Of course, In a Wicked Age is the king of all this.<br/><br/><b>Structure and closure</b><br/>Sorcerer actually has "structures that encourage events to move forward" in spades, but as noted this particular group had trouble engaging with those structures. Not sure what to replace them with. You reference set scene structure (like Contenders, right? Everyone has their scene, in which something is guaranteed to have moved forward, and meanwhile the Rep points are slowly building toward Endgame). That seems reasonably good, but doesn't prevent "drifting apart" <i>per se</i> (unless, as with Contenders, the Scene stipulations are centered around players interacting).

I'd very much welcome feedback on this, in light of the ongoing conversation:<br/><br/>Roleplaying games are all about creativity, cooperation, and competition - a weird and volatile mix.  Some games handle this stuff by clearly dividing authority - the usual model is a bunch of people reacting to the schemes of one guy in charge of creating the situation and providing the adversity.  As far as I'm concerned the guy in charge has all the fun, so in Fiasco the authority is evenly divided, and everyone is making stuff up and putting pressure on their friend's characters all the time.  For some people this is a very friendly and natural arrangement, but for others it might seem a little crazy.  Here's some advice if you find yourself in the crazy camp:<br/><br/>Authority means both freedom and responsibility - you're free to invent new people, places, and situations, but you have the responsibility to listen to your friends and make them look good.  If there's any real competition in Fiasco, it is the competition to offer the most interesting, satisfying stuff for other people to work with.  Usually, the most entertaining elements are the ones that cause the most trouble.  If you listen carefully, you'll probably hear your friends tell you what the perfect complication will be for their characters.  The choices they make as you set up the game, the sorts of scenes they choose, and their actions at the table are all flags they are waving, telling you where to apply pressure and offer them difficult choices.  I can't stress enough how important it is to listen. <br/><br/>While you have wide-open authority to introduce plot twists and new characters, you don't need to endlessly introduce new stuff.  Once the general outline of the game has emerged, it's much better to build on what's already been established.  If you're ever unsure how to proceed, there are a couple of tricks I use all the time.  The first is to review previous scenes and see if there's something fascinating that happened that could be reincorporated, maybe in a new way.  The second  is to glance at the relationships and details in play, and match up a couple that have not been used together.  The third - heartily recommended and more or less in constant use when I play - is to throw up your hands and ask for suggestions.  Chances are good that somebody has seen an interesting way forward that I would never have thought of.  Of course it's important to check in with your friends and make sure everybody is on board with your ideas - seek consensus and work together to craft the most engaging and exciting story you can.<br/><br/>One last note about this style of play - it really benefits from a facilitator.  If one player has a firm grasp on the rules, let them be a procedural resource during play.  They've probably got a good handle on how the game should be paced, so let them move things along or encourage folks to linger over a particularly juicy scene as appropriate.  A facilitator doesn't get any extra authority, but they can be very helpful in nudging the game in the right direction.  This tends to emerge naturally, but there's nothing wrong with calling it out in advance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180202/#Comment_180202" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T06:36:07+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  6:36AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first thought: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Roleplaying games are all about creativity, cooperation, and competition</blockquote>\nCompetition?

It's part of the natural social dynamic and some games are explicit about encouraging it (AGON), some are unsubtly implicit (3:16), some keep it sub rosa but supported by mechanics anyway (Grey Ranks) and many don't really weigh in on it at all.  Regardless, people compete - maybe in game resources and maybe in group prestige, or both.  Group prestige might be enhanced by skillful play (whatever skillful means in the game's context) or by social behaviors outside of the game environment.  In cooperative games, I think the competitive aspect revolves around creation, incorporation, and reincorporation - the person who brings the best stuff into the game "wins".  <br/><br/>I'm just thinking aloud at this point, maybe as a way to start the discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180232/#Comment_180232" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T08:59:05+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  8:59AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In cooperative games, I think the competitive aspect revolves around creation, incorporation, and reincorporation - the person who brings the best stuff into the game "wins". </blockquote>\nAnd best stuff there is tricky, too, as the player themself can't be the one to best judge that-it only makes sense in the context of the group.<br/><br/>Heck, there's even a prize: People seek to game with you more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180243/#Comment_180243" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T09:19:16+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  9:19AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll hit you with my core design philosophy.  Its my standard advice given to most game designs but I think it applies trebly to the sort of games you describe here.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIMO, the single most important rule in any game...proportionally becoming even more important in games that have fewer rules...is how a thing gets decided when players disagree.  A well designed game has a definite process / procedure that covers that "how".  I consider a game that lacks a clear process in this regard to be poorly designed regardless of how well designed the other aspects are.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat the "how" is, depends on the need of the game and feel you're trying to evoke in play.  I think there there are dozens of potential "hows"...only a few of which would be worth considering for any given game and possibly only 1 or 2 that would be ideal for that game.  So, I'm in no way promoting a specific form of "how"...just promoting the idea that the game requires it.<br/>\n<br/>\nALL games require it.  If you have a game that doesn't make it explicit in the rules...the game still requires it...you're just leaving it up to the group to figure out their own "how" in order to move forward.  Since so much of a game's flavor (and indeed even its ability to hit its design goals) can hinge on this "how"...leaving it up to the individual groups to decide risks them coming up with solutions that may be entirely incompatable with the rest of the game's design.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think alot of the discussion about indie games in particular where some players immediately grasp the game and fall in love with it while others are left scratching their heads wondering WTF can be directly traced to lack of clarity in the "how" in the rules.  Left to their own devices some groups will come up with a "how" that is similar to (or at least compatable with) the "how" the designer had in mind (conciously or un-) when they designed the game and they'll have no trouble jumping right in, playing the game, and resolving any rough spots in the rules.  Other groups will come up with a "how" that is completely at odds with the design assumptions of the game and they'll find the game almost completely unplayable.  They'll likely rail against the game loudly pointing out all sorts of flaws in the rules...flaws that would largely have disappeared (or at least not have been game breaking) if they'd been using the right "how".<br/>\n<br/>\nIts the game designers responsibility to make sure all players are aware of the "how" the game was designed to be used with...tweak at your own risk.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n"How" (as in "how do things get decided when players disagree") can be answered in a variety of ways:<br/>\nThe GM is always right and decides by fiat -- is a form of "How"<br/>\nRandomly roll and the high roller gets their way -- is another.<br/>\nAs is -- all players vote, each player has fiat over a limited area, players spend resources to get to say, who says rotates, or any other variation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ultimate default "how" is "argue about it until somebody yields or quits playing"...this one is the suck, and while many groups (I probably wouldn't agree with "most") are perfectly capable of finding their own "how" without resorting to this one, I firmly believe the onus is on the designer to ensure that they don't have to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180273/#Comment_180273" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T11:39:26+00:00" title="November 25, 2008 11:39AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 25, 2008 11:47AM by JDCorley.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Replying to the OP here, there is a big problem I have observed many times with many games in which there is more than one player with the ability to introduce significant elements into the fiction.  The big problem is this: matters of taste. Sometimes a player introduces something that another player doesn't "disagree with" exactly, but which they do not like or aren't excited by.  Disagreement is a social term that for whatever reason doesn't sound right here because the player doesn't want to speak up and veto the idea, they just don't like it.  "Well, THEY like it, and maybe it won't be as bad as I think, let's see where it goes." is one thing I've heard afterwards, as well as: "Everyone else at the table seemed to love it."   This is particularly true for games like PTA or IAWA where a considerable portion of the setting is improvised.<br/><br/>Tastes differ and collaboration often fails. That is the nature of collaboration, no rules will ever change its nature.<br/><br/>Edit: And I don't think this is a maturity/good-faith/bad-faith thing. People can completely sincerely think an idea sucks and still not speak up about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180284/#Comment_180284" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T12:20:14+00:00" title="November 25, 2008 12:20PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, I think the two are tied together very closely, JD.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mere presence of certain kinds of formal procedures can encourage people who otherwise wouldn't speak up to do so.  "It must be ok to say something here...its part of the rules".  Making it a part of the rules rather than just something that exists as a social contract thing shifts the burden to the game rather than the relationship making it easier to say "hey wait, I'm not sure I like that".<br/>\n<br/>\nI've seen this plenty of times in Universalis where the Negotiation rules really bring everybody into thinking about everything that enters the game and being willing to kibbitz about it, knowing that its an intentional part of play to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly the mere presence of certain other kinds of formal procedures can totally put the kybosh on people speaking up casually.  In Blood Red Sands I'm turning Universalis-style negotiation / bidding challenges on their head by turning every challenge into an in-your-face social gambit with both in game and meta game repurcussions.  That's creates an entirely different atmosphere for people to raise those issues you mention in.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy design goal for Uni was to encourage everybody constantly discussing and signalling their aesthetic preferences and "matters of taste".<br/>\n<br/>\nMy design goal for Blood Red Sands is to discourage this behavior in favor of "shut up, its my turn to talk...unless you want to take my right to talk away from me...no? then let me tell you how it is."<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo same core concept...having a very explicit set of rules for how disagreements between players get resolved when they're voiced establishes a very different play experience which impacts when and whether those disagreements are given voice to begin with.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's why I've come to think of this as the single most important set of rules in the game.  Essentially, its the only rule you need to have functional play happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180292/#Comment_180292" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T13:05:02+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  1:05PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience has been that rules can't give you permission to veto someone's creative contribution - only the relationship you have with them can do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180309/#Comment_180309" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T14:04:39+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  2:04PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aw, you're both right.

Having played games with new players without using the Challenge rules at all and having played games with new players where the Challenge rule was the first rule I introduced (and thus it got used almost constantly) I can safely say without hestitation and with absolute conviction...yes, rules absolutely CAN give you permission to veto someone's creative contribution.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only relationship you need to have with them is the basic agreement that everyone will play by the rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nRules aren't going to solve for dysfunctional social play...I'm not making that claim.

They find different things to be cool and fun than I do, and the nature of my relationship with them is that I like seeing their enthusiasm and they don't demand that I share it, and vice versa.  We bond strongly over whatever our crossover interests are, of course, but we don't limit our interaction to just those things; I'm not friends with only the part of them that likes what I like, I'm friends with <i>them</i>.<br><br>So if we sat down for a game of PTA (which would never happen again, but I'll pretend for the sake of this argument), they might come up with something that doesn't thrill me.  Probably would, in fact.  But I know that they really seem to like it, and so I cannot in good conscience tell them that I think their idea sucks without harming our relationship to some degree.  I especially cannot do it when what I mean by "Your idea sucks!" is "I personally do not like your idea and do not think it will be any fun at all, even though you clearly have things you want to do with it!"  Furthermore, if I take my differing creative sensibilities and fuck with their idea to make it work for me, I know that it will stop working for them...which similarly harshes the zen.  So my social instinct tells me to say nothing, because not only do I want them to have fun in this game, I do not want this game to become an issue in our real-life friendship.  I don't care if the rules say I can speak up, or if the rules tell me that I should speak up:  the rules may govern the game, but the game is happening with real-life people who I want to have a continuing friendship with, and there's no possible doubt in my mind about which is more important.  It could be the best fucking game in the history of the world, and it still would never be worth making my friends unhappy for.<br><br>Now, the problem for the game is that in something like PTA, the entire game is ruined if I am not thrilled with their idea.  It would be one thing if we were playing in a more traditional game, because then we could compartmentalize things: they would get to play scenes that involved what they liked, and I could sit on the sidelines and enjoy watching their enthusiasm without being required to share it, the same way I enjoy watching it in real life.  But instead, we're playing a game which demands that I must share their enthusiasm, even though that is impossible.  If I disengage from scenes involving their ideas, the game sucks for everyone, especially them.  If I try to engage in those scenes, I will fail and the game again sucks for everyone, especially me.  No one has fun, everyone loses.<br><br>Eventually the only reasonable answer is "hey, don't play that kind of game with those guys," which is in fact the answer we settled on.<br><br><br/>Edit:  As a side note, I don't have any qualms about speaking up on the rare occasions that I'm playing with people I don't know.  I have no real investment in their happiness beyond my general warmth of spirit towards all of mankind, so if the game rules tell me that I can shoot down their stupid fucking ideas, I will do so gleefully.  Nice, clear rules are a gift from god in those situations.  But it's very, very different when I am showing up on Saturday to play a game with my friends, because the "with my friends" part is about a billion times more important to me than the "play a game" bit.  Rules aren't going to have much effect there.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180344/#Comment_180344" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T15:50:13+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  3:50PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Responding to the opening post:<br/><br/>In my experience there is a design alternative in making a cooperative game, design the game so that inter-player invitation and trouble-making are not required for the base level of fun. Then use loose coupling from the mechanics to encourage more and more collaboration during the game. One way to introduce that loose coupling is to breakdown the idea of authority and ownership even more, making it less divided and more shared in terms of control of the fiction, thus while players do not require the input from other players they will find it easier to reincorporate. <br/><br/>That said, facilitators and a fall back for resolving player conflicts help a great deal.

Does anyone want to tackle that one?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180351/#Comment_180351" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T16:11:39+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  4:11PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bob, I already had an example in mind:\n<blockquote><cite>Excerpt from Coming of Age:</cite>Continuity<br/><br/>At the center of roleplaying a character is the idea that the world of the character will retain a certain consistency, that events will flow from one moment or description to the next. Coming of Age relies on this continuity to help bring the characters and hence you the players together. Because the antagonists are shared among you, how you describe the changes in those antagonists and in the wider world of the game directly affects what your fellow players can do.<br/><br/>While often taken for granted, continuity isn't automatic. Most of the time, each of you will respond to each others ideas and incorporate them into your actions and description. But sometimes a player will forget some detail important to you, like the fact that the demon knight has entered the castle already. If that happens, tell him. Politely remind him of the fact, and if it changes what he was planning to do, try to give an alternate suggestion. Be open to clarification by others, they might have different ideas of what had happened. Most importantly, work together to resolve the gap.<br/><br/>It may seem odd, but one of the keys to keeping the continuity working in Coming of Age is to not plan too far ahead. You already know where your character is headed, because of her titles and her opposition, the purpose of the game is to discover how she gets there. The dice, and more importantly your fellow players will surprise you. And that's what you should look forward to as part of playing Coming of Age.</blockquote>\n<br/>As for keeping things charged and going strong: Paradoxically, I suggest letting players take a breather during play. Not every thing you do must be built to maximize tension and set things up famously for your fellow players. Sometimes you'll want to take it easy, throw out a few ideas, or even just do the boring or silly thing. It's not easy to do that if your culture of play says you must engage or you are letting your fellow players down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180352/#Comment_180352" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-25T16:29:01+00:00" title="November 25, 2008  4:29PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm starting to really like official breathers in gaming, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_180412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180412/#Comment_180412" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-26T04:20:45+00:00" title="November 26, 2008  4:20AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that's another area where having a rule - "OK, at this point take a break, stretch, get a snack, talk about how things are going" - just reinforces and legitimizes what is probably a natural impulse that is too-easily overridden.

In the Apocalypse Now hack of TMW I ran this summer, the characters were mostly stuck on a Navy river patrol boat most of the time and the whole game was pretty tense. So I simply said, "Captain Willard is in the front of the boat going through maps. Who wants to go in the back of the boat and get high?" And there we had our "quiet" scene.<br/><br/><i>Montsegur: 1244</i> takes a different tack in that between Acts the rules say to actually step away from the table and take a break as players. Having that as an actual rule seemed a little weird at first. But Montsegur is pretty intense and emotional, and once we were all standing outside and chatting, we realized that we had <b>needed</b> a break.<br/><br/>I think it helps when the rules to take a break are actually spelled out in their own section or paragraph, rather than just tacking "take a break now" at the end of a paragraph about rolling dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_180466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/180466/#Comment_180466" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-26T10:38:20+00:00" title="November 26, 2008 10:38AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With respect to creative disagreement: It's probably a matter of taste how this is handled by the game rules. In Uni, it's a major part of the game, and something that makes players engage with the rules in a fun way - but also a way that, to me, disrupts the flow of the story. In Archipelago, with the "Do it differently, please" rule, it's something that players are encouraged to take in stride - change whatever doesn't work, move on in a gentlemanly fashion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
