We take it in turns to pick three ingredients, and then the other guy makes a setting, or a character, or an adventure out of them. Usually a setting. <br/><br/>Today, we used pictures. TheLoneAmigo picked these:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.keiththompsonart.com/images/full/colossus.jpg"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.keiththompsonart.com/images/full/sequester.jpg"/><br/>(does anybody else see the painting of Saint Mary tied to the mech's groinal tank?<br/><img alt="image" src="http://fc01.deviantart.com/fs42/f/2009/061/1/5/Chinese_Monastery_Concept_by_I_NetGraFX.jpg"/><br/><br/>He then suggested you guys might like to hear what I came up with.<br/><br/>there was a great war, between the Followers of the Twelvefold Path, and the group known as Mary's Blood. The Path used magics even they found distasteful to create the necrotic siege behemoths used to fight the Blood's mechanized warriors, but eventually they won, and the Blood where scattered to the five winds. <br/> <br/>Now, a generation later, the siege beasts have been re-purposed for ceremonial use, in the hopes of eventually cleansing them of their tainted creation and warlike use. <br/><br/>But sadly, the cleansing of the beasts is not the Twelvefold Path's greatest concern. While the Blood have failed in their attempt to dominate the continent through force of arms, now they are determined to dominate it through terror, or failing that, render it uninhabitable. <br/><br/>They are but few in number, and poorly equipped with outdated weapons, but they are determined, and the Path has long since tried to put any warlike ways it had behind it. <br/> <br/>So, it falls to the unclean, the last warriors of the Path to defend the society which rejects them and ensure that others live long enough to create the utopia they have striven so long for. <br/><br/>Three Sample Characters:<br/>A grizzled old war vet, huge, hulking, gray and scarred. Trained in martial arts which the Path no longer practice. <br/><br/>A lithe young girl who killed the man who tried to rape her, and refused to commit the cleansing rites as she saw his death as deserved. Bitter and vicious. <br/><br/>A sickly and pale scholar who has studied the creation of the beasts, and is probably one of the few men alive who could make more                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
