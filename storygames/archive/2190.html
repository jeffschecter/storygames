                    At a New Years Eve party I encountered a few other RPGers, whom I talked into playing Dogs in the Vineyards. Of particular note, one of the players was predominantly a larper (boffer variants), and described her play style in a way very similar to some of the ways I used to play in vampire (Mind's Eye Theater) larps, and it occured to me that this particular approach to play may be more common than I thought.<br/><br/>Specifically, creating a character with a deep metagame perspective - as in planning fitness with other players and their characters, ensuring specific types of situations you want versus those you don't (e.g. avoiding large combats), and otherwise pre-planning all of this into the character. And then following this by a deep immersive play - with minimal metagame thought occuring. <br/><br/>What intrigues me about this, is there is a self-competition aspect to this, about crafting the character that will - simply played to the hilt - produce the desired situations and satisfy the meta-game, without the need to retool or otherwise consider the meta-game while playing. The challenge itself makes things fun, in addition to the immersion.<br/><br/>Any thoughts?<br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                </div>

                            Hey Mendel,<br/><br/>My group is really huge on the collaboration element of roleplaying games, where I often feel like "Oh, god, let's stop clogging the game with these discussions" at times.<br/><br/>When we started Sorcerer, we spent an entire group meeting discussing the game and setting and tone, and another entire group meeting doing character generation (meaning that we didn't hit play till the 3rd session).<br/><br/>By the time we got going, I had a very clear idea of who Jordan was. I had goals. I had snappy comebacks already resting inside my head. I knew who I was planning to hate.<br/><br/>I approached each session, and each scene, with a very clear agenda for immersion. When JB (our GM) cut to the gym scene where my coach approaches to me "have a little talk", I already know that I'm going to be cold, cut him off, twist his words. I'm going to give him nothing, but at the same time I'm not going to be directly rude in any way. Just brisk.<br/><br/>As far as Sorcerer goes, when the scene is mine it's immersion time. There is little to no collaboration. The scenes are quite short, because (a.) I have fairly simple goals for what I want to resolve/prove in every scene, and (b.) there is less "well, you could always" kind of talk. The scenes are very tight.<br/><br/>I don't know that this is the "best" way to play a character, but I'm loving it. I have metagame goals for him. I know what I want as future demons. I am flexible on all counts, but I definitely have a vision and I have immersed myself in it.                        </div>

                            Mendel, I suspect this is in fact the mode of operation of <em>most</em> long-time gamers.  Character creation is one of the primary means of player input in tons upon tons of games, and games in which there is little opportunity for player input later in the game.  Cgen is often their one chance to put their preferred spin on the upcoming game.                        </div>

                            I've done this. When designing my current Werewolf LARP character, I wanted to play a knowledgeable character, but I didn't want to constantly double-check my knowledge of the setting with the GM. I wanted to make stuff up on the spot and state it as fact, in a way that isn't always blessed in Setting-heavy White Wolf LARP.<br/>
<br/>
So I made the character a knowledgeable and glib habitual liar. That way if I made something up on the spot that was later shown to be false, I could just shrug: clearly for some reason my character was lying at the time!                        </div>

I'm not exactly sure on what you're asking, but I'm reading it as if there's pre-planning for what's going to happen in the game tied to the character creation. Based on my experiences and prefered playing style, yes and no. On the question if immersive play needs pre-planning of the character (regardless of what will happen in the play), then yes.<br/><br/>I suspect the need to ditch the re-tooling and metagame during the play is one of the reasons, but not the only one. LARPing tends to lead you towards playing which minimizes the need for metagame and re-tooling character during the partly because it lacks tools to do these things - LARPs are distributed by nature and there's no single focal point where this kind of re-tooling could be done and communicated to other participants (which also tends to lead towards static settings); the players are mostly on their own, and without tools for metagame communication, they need a clear and front-loaded mental image of the character, other characters and setting in general.<br/><br/>Another reason for front-loading is that immersive player needs it in order to, well, immerse. If the goal is to emulate a fictional person, you need a mental image of the person before you start playing. You need to have a hunch of how he thinks, how he sees other people and how he sees the world in general, in order to incorporate these things and be able to act upon them. It's not easy to suddenly incorporate, for example, the idea of character being a gay, since that affects a lot of things and feels weird if you've played the guy as straight so far. Breaks the continuity, so to speak.<br/><br/>Tailoring the character with regards to the game is a tool, either for the GM (for prepared characters) or the players. It certainly can be used to achieve to avoid certain things; if you want to produce a highly emotional event in the play, it makes sense to prepare characters who are emotional and a starting situtation which is prone to create emotional events. Or if you want to avoid emotional events, you prepare a character that is somehow "safe" from them and in a starting situtation which does not deal with emotional stuff. The LARPs with prepared characters tend to start with questionnaires around here, which ask on scale of 1 to 5, how emotional/prone to intrigue/etc the character should be.<br/><br/>I'm not sure about the challenge aspect; I'm prone to think that directly challenging the player is unproductive since the goal of immersive playing is remove the sense of playing a character from the player. On the other hand, a character with challenges tends to lead more intense experience.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Mendel, I suspect this is in fact the mode of operation of<em>most</em>long-time gamers. </blockquote>
I'd agree with that.<br/><br/>Typically I ask two questions right off the bat when creating a character: the first is "What do I want to do a lot of in this game?" and the second is "What do I really not want to do, ever?"  Knowing those two things (and knowing what I personally think is fun to do in a game) guides me when I sit down and think about what kind of person my character is, what elements I want in his personality, his goals, his background, and so on.  In crunchier rule systems, it also steers my choice of skills and powers: I may choose to be bad at something I want to do a lot of in order to make a big deal out of having to cope with being bad at it, or I might choose to be nigh-omnipotent at a skill when I never want to see any complications or challenges arising from it.  All in all, this has made gaming more fun for me.<br/><br/>Before I learned to ask those two questions, though, I made a lot of characters that were interesting but totally horrible to play.  They weren't front-loaded to deliver the kinds of things that I wanted out of the game, and it wasn't possible to retcon them into something more suitable...they were just a drag.  Someone else could've probably picked them up and had a grand time with them, but they weren't a good fit for me.<br/><br/><br/>...and I'm not sure about "the challenge itself makes it fun," necessarily.  I mean, I <i>do</i> think it's fun to optimize a character -- it's one of the things I really enjoy in d20 games and superhero systems -- but the goal, at least for me, is for it to be not a challenge at all to design a character that way.  Learning to be good at designing characters that make the game fun for me is strictly the means to an end, not an end in and of itself; if I were making awesomely entertaining characters by accident and never needed to think about what I was doing when designing them, I'd be just as happy.                        </div>

                            By way of an analogy, in Vernor Vinge's The Peace War, one of the past-times of that setting is a game where you determine the starting trajectory of a ship and send it off in a three body problem, aiming for a target. You predict the interactions, and try to hit the target under different configurations of planets. It is clearly a competative game, a cross between darts and chess. <br/>
<br/>
The sort of front-loaded immersion I'm talking about is that same idea. You choose your character's initial trajectory, and attempt to reach your target by predicting how it will interact with everything else in play, game and meta-game. This is a definite challenge, especially for self-competition. And can be fun in its own right.<br/>
<br/>
The targets could be simple, such as the Dogs in the Vineyards character that will never escalate to fighting - designed specifically to remove the chance of intra-Dog combat. More complex targets, like achieving a long term goal, can make this very interesting. Sometimes how we overshoot our goals is even more interesting, such as the time I inadvertantly won a Vampire: the Masquerade larp. Especially as it showed how a character can exploit both player and character behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly the basic skills are common. But the learning and advancement of those skills - through immersive play - is a source of fun in itself. Prioritizing that type of fun in play is not nearly as common. Front-loaded immersion need not be simply a tool for play, but a reason to play on its own.<br/>

                            I think that, like any chargen where you are very satisfied with the character at the end, that this sort of chargen can be rewarding, sure.<br/>
<br/>
I'd also note, however, that, in fact, most chargen systems don't give you any tools to determine how to best make these things. Even designs that are putatively about immersion. WOD games, for example, can only claim that their splat method of chargen gives some structure to the choices. But in, say, GURPS, the "make anything you want" mode of chargen doesn't provide you with a single tool from which to make such a character.<br/>
<br/>
That's not to say that people such as AFT above haven't built those skills. But they've had to. As Jukka points out, many people would feel better if it were an easier process and not quite the challeng that it can be without good tools.<br/>
<br/>
That is, the current work-to-reward ratio is pretty high in most systems.<br/>

                            I'm not sure if I've seen (much) of the type of front-loading Mendel proposes; since playing is mostly interaction with other characters and less with setting (considering that, for example, Dogs need to issue judgements and tendency to shoot is part of the setting), it's pretty hard to create character trajectory. I'd be tempted to say that a lot of the time the opposite happens; the GM or larpwright tries to create trajectories that will almost certainly overlapse. In a sense, puts so many things into air that some trajectories are bound to cross their paths. Players tend to do the same if they create their characters, though in less systematic fashion, lacking the overall picture that GM has.<br><br>That, of course, when front-loading is mostly done by the GM. I'd suppose that the other kind of front loading is more common if players do it; kind of goals for the character, avoid this or that, or achieve something by doing this or not doing that.<br><br>Most chargens don't give you anything on those, like Mike said. Just painting your characters with abstract numbers ("attributes", "skills", "demeanor", "contacts" or  whatever) gives you pretty much nothing to work with. Some chargens, like (I think) Dogs which assigns dices to relationships, are a nudge towards the right direction. I'd love to see a chargen that would guide you through creating a full personality and meaningfull relationships. But I digress.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

Perhaps that's true for someone else, but it isn't for me.  I don't know, man -- I think I got my "character design just for fun" itch permanently scratched back when I was a callow youth who couldn't ever find a game that lasted more than three sessions, and figuring out how to make characters well was the closest thing I had to gaming.<br><br>These days, my reason to play is the game itself.  If that's not the main reason why I'm there, then I'll just do something else with my time; the days when I could derive sufficient joy from thinking up a character to make the effort worthwhile in and of itself are long behind me.                        </br></br></div>

                            I don't think that the fun of initally designing a character is a big part of this, but comes from putting that character into play.  I've done similiar things myself, of setting up a character and then immersing myself in that character, and a part of the fun is not so much the character creation itself, but looking back after x sessions and being able to think to myself that I created that character so nicely that I'm getting what I want out of a game without being constantly aware of that as a goal in my play.  I can play the character using immersion techniques and if I set the character up right in the first place that takes me to the same place as if I was making meta decisions all along the way.  And that does give me a sense of achievement.  So, yeah, I've experienced this too.<br><br>Claire                        </br></br></div>

                            Of course the intriguing aspect of this appraoch becomes the idea that there is no longer (theoretically) a disparity between immersion and the social contract.  The social contract is hopefully built into the character thus there is no conflict between what is the most likely the best course of action for the character and what is best for the game/group as a whole.  I agree that this isn't common and maybe a nice common-ground between folk that don't like some of the story driven games I run because they "just want to play their character."  ie. I get a lot of flak from some of my role-playing friends because they think the games tend to focus on the "macro-perspective" (meta-game, I suppose) too much and not enough in-character interaction.<br/><br/>I suppose the danger becomes the long-term.  I mean, you can't plan for every eventuality.  At some point your going to HAVE to make that decision based on "what's best for my character is not necessarily best for the story or the game."  Unless the perspective is very short or your reapproaching your character generation/development anew every few games I don't know how you can avoid these decisions while playing.  Is it possible that someone says they are doing this but in reality are either making the social contract decisions or ignoring the social contract all together claiming that its mroe fun?<br/><br/>I mean, sure the Dogs example may be fun for you but you begin to take back seat when the OTHER players all start shootouts, no?                        </div>

                            This seems pretty common to me, as well. In a traditional mindset, character generation is the only part of the game in which you are <i>allowed</i> to use your player-given knowledge to position yourself advantageously for the kind of play you want. After you start playing that sort of thing is no good, 'meta-gaming', etc. etc. Besides that baggage, it's also an effective way to get what you want out of a game, even if what you want isn't immersion at all -- chargen typically includes all sorts of other important things like generating the basic situation, setting up flags, etc. Moreover, there is no way to make a character without thinking about all these things at least a little bit -- you can't immerse in a character before you make one. I suppose a contrary method would be to choose character traits based entirely on emotional &amp; psychological sympathy, while doing your best to ignore any larger-scope concerns of the game -- but that still sounds like the same general thing, where you make choices about what character you will play so that when you actually play you'll have less work to do.                        </div>

                            From the OP: Preach it! I think that the converse for the GM (for traditional games) is making <i>scenarios</i> that if played to the hilt using internal-causuality will produce the sort of thing you're looking for (highly thematic play). I think Hero and GURPS do give you the tools to do this (and I disagree with Mike, I think, about the work-reward ratio--but perhaps that's only a matter of degree and my perspective).<br/><br/>Things like flags (and to a lesser extent things like TROS's SAs) really help with this.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

Oh sure--and more tools are always better than less tools. And what is value added for one person can be a hinderance or neutral to another. I just think saying "doesn't provide a single tool" isn't congruent with my experience.<br><br/>-Marco                        </br></div>

                            Well, like what would count as tools for this purpose in GURPS? Templates might make it easier to create characters, in terms of effort. But what we're talking about in terms of tools to put your metagame needs into the character...that I'm not seeing any of in GURPS. Quirks? Nah. I mean the point is that simply allowing a character to be statted out is the minimum that all games do here. The question is how does the game ask you the question, "What's going to be fun to play?" and then help you to answer that question?<br/>

                            I'm guessing we're not going to see eye-to-eye on this as a matter of fundamental perspective. I think that the statting up of a character *is* the tool that determines what will be fun to play. I believe that any time this is done relevant to a setting and starting situation it's inherent in the operation (I haven't played in many GURPS games that were literally *make anything you want*).<br><br>I think that point-based design is a *powerful* tool--and I say this from having recently played randomizing systems.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </br></br></div>

                            Marco, the subject is not tools to make a character fun. Of course point-based systems do that. The subject is tools that a game gives to a player in order to take certain specific metagame needs, and ensure that they come out in play. It's like you're saying, "Sure, you have all you need to build a good foundation, cement." And I'm saying, "Yeah, but if you want to build certain shapes in the concrete it would be nice to have special trowels that one could use to craft those things."<br/>
<br/>
Again, again, again, nobody is saying that you can't take the raw materials of a point-based system, and create exactly the sort of character who is imbued with the right characteristics to promote those metagame goals. We're just saying that there are no second-order tools provided to make it any easier.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, as a bad example meant for clarification only, if there was a questionaire that you answered before making a GURPS character that had questions like:<br/>
<br/>
1. Are you looking to play a character who gets into a lot of action?<br/>
2. Do you want your character to have to deal with internal issues?<br/>
3. Would you like your character to be embroiled in intepersonal struggles?<br/>
<br/>
Etc.<br/>
<br/>
And then if the answers to the questionaire lead you to suggestions for how to create a character that would be more likely to produce the sort of play you're looking for. That would be the sort of tool we're talking about. A bad example of such a tool, but the sort of tool in question.<br/>
<br/>
As it stands, an experienced player can probably do this without any help just using the point system. But I and others here have noted that for inexperienced players, sans such help, players tend to <i>occasionally</i> make characters that they don't find fun in play; such a tool might help these players. And, who knows, with the right tool, even experienced players might find that their enjoyment is heightened.<br/>
<br/>
Hard to know if we don't try to produce any such systems.<br/>
<br/>
Think of it as a spectrum.<br/>
<br/>
1. Randomized generation - little player input<br/>
2. Buy systems - all player input<br/>
3. Metagtame support buys - all player input with tools to help guide the player.<br/>
<br/>
Any clearer?<br/>

                            It's perfectly clear, and has been <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> If you say "no tools beyond that of specifically controlled creation of the character (i.e. no 'kicker'-style input)" then I'd agree. If you say "not a single tool" then I don't. I think point-based character creation is an *amazingly* powerful tool--not just foundation and cement--since the character will, IME, be created in response to some kind of specific input about the game itself. I count that as at least 1-4 "walls" and often a "roof" ('And *no* stripper-ninjas,' says the GM). Getting a decent alignment with meta-game goals out of that is often (IME, YMMV) powerful and intuitive.<br><br>Contrawise, It's my experience that a lot of players, especially first-time players (but even experienced ones) may not have a good idea of what they want from a game ... especially before it starts or before they've had a chance to get into it (especially since we're talking about those damn-dirty-immersionists here <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ). <br><br>So it's a question of what constitutes "a single tool" not whether (A) Game-X has them or (B) whether they would be value-added for someone.<br><br>On a more thread-related topic:<br>From my experience here is what helps make characters 'fit' (which is really what I think we're talking about here--but you're free to disagree).<br><br>1. Some idea of the context of the situation. I can make a character who is struggling with his family coming apart because of alcoholism, even have a kicker that uses that--but if the game focus and the focus of the other PCs is elsewhere it may not be a lot of fun. Having the issue is less valuable without meaningful 'traction.' In the game.<br><br>2. Some connection with the other PCs (and Players on the Player level). The more relevant one character is to another (even if they are not "there" in the game) the higher I find the energy of play (IME, YMMV, I've and reasonable games where the PCs never met up).<br><br>3. A situation that reflects *the character.* It's fine to have a character who fits with the game (the standard D&amp;D adventuring party). Having this go another cycle and tailor the situation to the character is, IMO, the way to act on whatever 'fitness' the character has (in this case it would be not just making the adventuring party but having the dungeon specifically apply to the characters in some way).<br><br>I think that games like AD&amp;D-dungeoneering and DitV do two or three of these innately by having a generally constrained situation. I think most prep-work I've seen for non-module GURPS play does the first two easily (but not always the third*). <br><br>I believe the reason these elements work is very simple: if you know what the other players are there for and there is some some attempt to align that then in many cases you will get not onlyhigher-energy play but you'll get it without requiring as much meta-game activity during play. Getting back to your suggestion, If the "tool," whatever it is, (such as the questionnaire), is focused on the single character I think it has a scoping problem with regards to what I see as the biggest factor in getting front-loaded immersionist play: it's better (IMO) to address the situation as well as the rest of the team.<br><br>-Marco<br>* In the last how-to-GM chapter I wrote, I lay out these steps specifically. There's a scenario-creation chapter as well as a character creation chapter.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>
