                    My biggest bitch? Pick a theme that your game is about, and stick to it! If it's "Power Corrupts," frame it accordingly.<br/>

Also, let the players have the awesome powers...but make it precarious, so that unless they do well, things will go out of control. (Think "Sorcerer's Apprentice.")<br/>

                            I've lately been playing old Mage sort of like Dogs. Each episode the players have a chance to rewrite reality to be a little bit more to be what like their paradigm says it should be. And each episode they get hit with the moral problems, broken lives, shattered dreams, and fact that no, people can't just get along and agree that the Mages are right. Thus it becomes a game of "you have the power to remake the world. What do you want it to be? Okay, now you're heading down that road, what about now? What about now?"                        </div>

                            Remember, Brand got paid to awesomeofy Mage. As such, I'm always eager to pick his brain about "What the hell exactly <i>was</i> that game about, anyway?" It seemed to get dragged all over the place editorially. I seem to be the only person in my own gaming circles who thought there was enough neat potential to be worth playing. Maybe the notion of magic as, well, magic! was too much for the usual engineer-head gang to be comfortable with.                        </div>

Meh. "Power Corrupts" is overdone. All of White Wolf's other games are about Power Corrupting. Mage is the only one that starts to deviate from that by saying "hey, sometimes you can do good things with power, too." Mage is cool because it gives you real choices. Making it Sorcerer with a conventional system would be boring and overdone.                        </div>

                            oWoD Mage suffered from having a rather schizophrenic development (the various editions exacerbated this of course).

One way I often messed with Mage was to jettison the philosophy, reduce Paradox drastically, and just make it a comic book good-and-evil world. It cranked up the aciton big-time.                        </br></br></div>

There's no reason you can't do both. Lots of comic books do.                        </div>

                            One of my favorite quotes from an old Mage game (that no longer applies in the new Mage) exemplifies what I think was the best element from Ascension: "It's only vulgar until you sell it to the military." Our Son of Ether had more impact on the world's paradigm than the rest of the (10-person) group put together. Paradigm mattered. Awakening doesn't give a good goddamn what your character or the rest of the world thinks: <i>this</i> is how it works, <i>this</i> is what paradox spanks you for, and you <i>are</i> doing Atlantean magic, whether you think you are or not.<br><br>Not that that's bad, I just like Ascension better.                        </br></br></div>

                            Larry, <br><br>I was paid to awesomize Vampire, not Mage. I've never actually published anything professional for Mage. At least, not that I remember. <br/><br/>But yea, all of the oWoD lines either started off with MPD or developed it over the years of their runs. Mage wasn't as bad as Changeling, but it did get kicked one way and then another several times.

                            Whoops! My mistake! While I'm putting forth fictional notions about Brand:
<ul>
<li>Brand Robins used to live in darkest Africa, where he wrestled and killed lions with his bare hands.</li>
<li>Brand Robins was once the papal secretary of role-playing games. Coming up with Latin phrases for all that gaming jargon was a real bitch.</li>
<li>Brand Robins once possessed super strength gained from a radioactive meteor, enabling him to hammer-throw automobiles with ease. But he traded it all away for love!</li>
</ul>
(Here, I scrunch up my face all cutesy-like.)<br/><br/>Nearly everything I can think of about Mage threatens to become a bitch-session rather than anything fruitful.<br/><br/>My favorite thing about Mage was the emphasis on coincidental magic, where the "magicness" of your actions was dubious from a rational, scientific perspective. (And thus, innocuous to Paradox.) I guess a game focused magic as an alternate worldview, not necessarily incompatible with material philosophy, would be pretty cool.<br/><br/>Probably, I'd just use <i>Sorcerer </i>for any such thing.                        </div>

                            I ran a couple of long-term Mage games.  I will say that when it rocked, it <i>rocked.</i>  And every game, we burned the equivalent of two or three sessions while players mastur-debated about their paradigms.  The first time, it was cool and felt like immersive RP.  After that, well, the blush wore off and it pretty much turned out to be the same old tail-chasing runaround where story stalled, interesting character development stalled.<br/><br/>That said, I really liked the coincidental/vulgar split, and felt that in combination with creative and individualized use of foci, it represented the core of the game.  I actually liked 1st ed. Mage rules for fixed Tradition foci better, because there was a lot of creative leeway to define what a "staff" was for a Verbena, for example, or a "ring" to a Cultist, but the constraints felt more structured, and I liked that.                        </div>

                            The thing I liked best about <u>Mage</u>, and that I've never found anywhere else, is the way the central conflict in the game's setting (between Traditions and Technocracy) mirrored much larger intellectual debates in society: between freedom and control, between nature and culture, between The Man and everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
That's what fueled all the tiresome flamewars, but it also made for a very fun setting, since you could move pretty seamlessly between philosophical debate and shooting folks in the face.  That's why I want to run a Technocracy/Men in Black game using <u>Dogs in the Vineyard </u>at some point, because Dogs does that talking/shooting thing really well.  The new version of Mage has its charms, but it has almost none of the philosophical tension I mention above.<br/>
<br/>
The things I didn't like about the rules as written would fill a long post, but I'll just mention the central that were nearly inescapable for me: the mechanics were so vague in so many important places that you had to have a rock-hard understanding of them as a group to make things really work.                        </div>

                            My only remaining idea for a good Mage setting is one where there is no dominant, global paradigm. Ideally this would be a modern setting where the Technocracy ended up losing in a boring, unimportant way, and now every city, state, or even neighbourhood, can have its own operant paradigm of reality, allowing for advantages and disadvantages both to its occupants and the mages who live or work there.<br><br>Obviously, you would want to pair this with some interesting mechanics for both affecting paradigm and interacting with very different magical realities. Most areas with strongly-divergent paradigms would probably be the result of a mage or chantry's efforts, or the result of some particular cultural heritage or background (i.e. homogenous ethnic neighbourhoods). Corporations would probably be involved -- if you can run your factory in that part of Cleveland where <i>there is no friction</i> that's probably going to speed up production, but even better might be getting some of those Golems from the Bronx to work the line.                        </br></br></div>

<p>Yeah, you gotta pick a theme. And there's so damn many! But the one's I'd shop from:</p>
<ul>
<li>What Will You Sacrifice for FREAKY PSEUDOGNOSTIC/ATLANTEAN POWERZ?!? (Works for oMage and nMage. If you played it low-key with buildups, showing the costs of intramage politics and maintaining real world relationships, I think it would be a lot of fun.)</li>
<li>Mage Action Team: Mix and match your corresponding factions to fight the man. (Fun, but I did it that enough times.)</li>
<li>Politics &amp; Mage War: Specifically play at the politics and conflicts between Mage factions. Either put everyone in the same faction, or else make their distribution among multiple factions focal to the potential conflict at hand.</li>
<li>Amateur Philosophy: Frame the game to specific highlight interesting philosophical questions/monologues. I actually have no idea how I'd frame/prep for such a scenario...</li>

                            For me, the idea that beliefs really matter was one of the most awesome things about Mage, and I'd make this central to the mechanics and the setting. I'd also use a lot of Unknown Armies style hooks.<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
<br/>
You know when you send a parcel to someone, you give it to the mail guys, and a few days later it's delivered? Ever think about how it gets there?<br/>
<br/>
That's the point. Most people only think about sending the parcel, and the other guy getting it, and no-one cares about what happens in between. <i>It might as well be magic...</i><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
---<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time a lot of people believed that if you knew someone's True Name, the name that's written in their soul, it gave you power over that person. Nowadays, hardly anyone believes in that stuff anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Except, everyone <i>does</i> have a secret name. Ever give anyone your Social Security Number, your credit card number, your bank account details? Your PIN number? Some names are secret, and they hold more power than you think. It's called "identity theft" for a reason...                        </div>

You could do it like a philosophical debate-scenario in <i>Nobilis</i>: pick an interesting question, such as: it better to live in a free but chaotic community, or should you give up some freedom for security and reliability?<br><br>Then pick two important NPC's or cabals to represent the two extreme sides of the argument, and something for them to fight over as the stakes.  That's the situation that you throw the PC's into.  By their actions and alliances, they figure out their solution to the philosophical quandry.  <br><br>So in nMage, you could have a city whose magical affairs are ruled by a unruly group of Free Council mages (representing "freedom and anarchy"), which also has a small but growing presence of the Guardians of the Veil, the self-appointed Mage police, who think the town is being mismanaged and they're freaking out the Mundanes way too much.  To make the situation more fraught, put some valuable resources in town, and make the NPC's on both sides of the divide fairly ruthless in their pursuit of the valuable Maguffins.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Ooh.  That's really good.  Obsolesce the out-of-game debates.  Consensual reality doesn't care about how things <i>should</i> be, it cares about precedent.  And establishing those precedents is what mages do to try and control reality.                        </div>
