Not at all. Either people will bring the money to buy and play my games too, or else they'll be the kind of folks who are interested in something other than 4E.<br/><br/>Consideration of what will happen after GenCon? I want to aim to sell my games at GenCon, at least have them prepared and ready to roll in August. Because if I don't and D&amp;D 4E comes out, I will buy 4E and probably be playing it so hard that I will slack on finishing up my games; and will have to push deadlines back another year or something.<br/><br/>So basically, I want to be done before 4E, because when it comes out I imagine I'll be playing the shit out of it. But at the same time, it's not stopping me from rethinking a release date for my own stuff: Before, after or during the Mad 4E Rush.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121813/#Comment_121813" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T21:26:28+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  9:26PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aye Clint,<br/><br/>I believe the release date is far in advance of Gen Con, in the spring at some point.<br/><br/>And no, it doesn't change anything for me.<br/><br/>Judd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121814/#Comment_121814" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T21:59:02+00:00" title="January 24, 2008  9:59PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2008 9:59PM by C.W.Richeson.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            June 6th is the release date for all three core books.<br/><br/>I suspect the vast majority of folk will have bought them well in advance of Gen Con.
