Some of my guys have been playing since before I was born so I think it's fair to say I'm a little intimidated. I found the game GRIMM a while back and after owning the book for several months I decided the only was I was likely to get to PLAY was to run a game for my mostly male group. They are all pretty open-minded, and are encouraging me to run my game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a framework for the game I want to run. The system aims for six sessions per campaign, so I'm gonna try and stick with that. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Setup: Since Disney began making princess and fairytale movies the Grimm Lands have been closed off from the real world. It's been sixty years since the last children wandered through gates between the worlds. With the surge of dark fairytales in pop culture the gates are slowing beginning to open again. In Hamlin, North Carolina old stories are starting to kick up again. The rats, a byproduct of the local industrial bakery, have been breeding more and more lately and getting everywhere and ghost stories about missing kids are becoming sleepover favorites again. <br/>\n<br/>\nSix children come together one night, all drawn to a local church basement by an amazing music. As the climb down the stairs they pass through a gate into the Grimm Lands. They find themselves in a rat infested basement filled with children dressed from other times. The most recent looking clothing dates back to the early fifties. At the front of the room is a man playing a flute. He's the pied piper, if the kids touch any of the already enthralled children they will begin hearing whispers; the enthralled kids crying out, begging them to run before he gets them enthralled too, telling them to find The Sleeping Beauty, telling them they have to get home. The longer they stay in the basement the harder it is to leave. If they take one of the enthralled kids with them then they get a handy NPC who will help point them in the right direction if I need to.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce they leave the basement they learn they're not in Kansas anymore, the world outside the basement is a wild tangled landscape, just beside the house they were in is a giant wall of green, this continues on from horizon to horizon, it blocks the road to the west but there is what seems to be the faint outline of a door for those who make a perception check.  The kids can try and open the door to the beanstalk, if they get it open they\u2019ll be greeted by a gnome (think garden gnome) who will demand money for their crossing. They can get to anywhere in the Grimm Lands  from the beanstalk but it will cost them and is very dangerous. <br/>\n<br/>\nThrough the campaign I want the PCs to explore the Grimm Lands while trying to find a way home. I want to give the game a more puzzle type feel than actual combat and fighting. Grimm is a place where wits will win you everything. They\u2019re kids they can use their imagination to shape the world a bit. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo far I have two ways for PCs to get home. One is from The Sleeping Beauty; when they get to her anyone but the last child to touch the ring on her hand, a strange thing made of green material will instantly go back home. The last child who touches her ring will wake her up. As each child left Grimm Sleeping Beauty gets progressively older. When the last child touches the ring she is an old woman, she forces the ring onto the child\u2019s hand and keeps whispering about Dorothy\u2019s Slippers or The Silver Slippers. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe other way home is for one child only. The slippers that Dorothy wore to get home, the child has to wear them and click the heels together while saying \u2018there\u2019s no place like home\u2019. The shoes are in the Museum of Grimm, which is open to the public and due to the nature of Grimm\u2019s repeating history all of the displays are open to those who ask.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat\u2019s all I have for now. I\u2019ve got no sense of middle and I think I should put together a few more ways home if the PCs don\u2019t take the bait and go for Sleeping Beauty. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions would be immensely helpful. I\u2019m really unsure about what the heck I\u2019m doing.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353457/#Comment_353457" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-08T07:24:28+00:00" title="January  8, 2012  7:24AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These questions will help us give you better suggestions...<br/><br/><br/>What 3 specific things do you want help with?

But if I could go back, I would've tried any of the following...<br/><br/>- Guest GMed a 1 shot in our current campaign. That way I do minimal work and it's only 1 night. I also get a sense of what it is like to run games for these specific people and can use that when planning my longer game.<br/><br/>- Enlist one of the experienced GMs (who is good with sharing and is patient) to co-GM with me.<br/><br/>- Play a game like Fiasco first, where we are all mini-GMs. That way I get practice running games without having it all be on me, <br/><br/>- At the start of my game, set expectations. "Hey everyone, this is my first time, I'm nervous, but if you help me, I'm sure we can make this a great learning experience. We all have to start somewhere. If there are problems, please help and please be patient.

When you imagine what could go wrong, what is it?<br/>\nHow to plan beyond the initial game, how to handle when the players take me by surprise, how to lead the game without railroading(if possible).<br/>\nMostly I'm worried about being under prepared, that and the idea my players will decided to stay in the Grimm Lands, learn magic and run amuck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat are your friends like? What games do they enjoy? How would you describe their roleplaying? How many players? How long is each session?<br/>\nMost of my guys have been gaming for a lot longer than I have (some since before I was born). They like the challenge of creating characters to 'troll the DM' with a lot of the times, though they've said they'd go easy on me for my first game. They're super creative and often find solutions that bring the game to a stop for a few moments as our veteran GMs try and process what just happened. We don't play any one game  all the time, it's a mix, some of the favorites are D&amp;D 3.5, Pathfinder, Star Wars, mutants and masterminds, and Call of Cthulhu d20. We're very much into the role playing aspect of gaming, we never use minis and tend to get into our characters. Depending on which weekend it is I can have between 5-9 players. Sessions tend to last from about 6pm to midnight or just after.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat problems (if any) come up in your normal games?<br/>\nOur games tend to run smoothly but some of the creative ways we handle things will bring the game to a stop for a few minutes. (We once set pigs loose in a convention to make a distraction during Shadowrun). Other than that I've not seen too many problems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353460/#Comment_353460" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-08T07:47:52+00:00" title="January  8, 2012  7:47AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2012 1:37PM by Brian_Minter.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Dominique,<br/><br/>All John's advice is wise and useful. I'm sure your group will be understanding for your first time out.<br/><br/>As for your specific plan, it sounds like you're working hard to come up with a complete storyline. Like you said, you have "no sense of the middle".<br/><br/>I don't think you need one. I think it's okay, even preferable, to have NO IDEA what's going to happen. That's the fun of role-playing. The players in your game are going to do crazy, interesting, unexpected things (like the pigs at the convention), and your job is just to saw "Wow! Awesome!" and run with whatever happens. <br/><br/>So have your set-up ready, and have some interesting NPCs and monsters and obstacles that you can use as needed, but mostly just be ready to respond to whatever the characters do, and be genuinely interested in the story that will unfold.<br/><br/>PS - I've never played GRIMM, so I might be missing something important about how it works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dldzioba" title="dldzioba"><img alt="dldzioba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dldzioba">dldzioba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353462/#Comment_353462" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-08T07:52:40+00:00" title="January  8, 2012  7:52AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't seem to find many people who have played Grimm.

Not to mention 9 players throw a LOT of coordinated power around.  The toughest monsters in the Grimm book will be trivially defeated by a group of this size who has played together and knows teamwork.<br/><br/>For your first campaign, you don't have to concern yourself too much with railroading. Just don't do it. It's not rocket science.  If some kids decide to stay in Grimm, cool. When they sleep, they dream of their distraught parents harassing the police and their dumb little brother searching and searching around the church, the basement door ominously always in view.  If they still decide to stay in Grimm and learn magic, set up a new goal (the Mathemagician is rumored to take on apprentices) and obstacles, and go in that direction.<br/><br/>But likely they will accept the "get home" goal.<br/><br/>You have two ways listed that at least one of the characters can get home, but my guess is that once the other kids get home, the one remaining kid who is the last to have the ring is not going to want to play a one-on-one game about getting the slippers with you while everyone else twiddles their thumbs (or goes drinking to celebrate their success?)  I'd just have it be the way everyone gets home and that's that.  <br/><br/>I'd suggest an opposition that wants them to stay in Grimm for some reason - the ones responsible for the music. That personalizes the mission of getting home, embodies it in a wicked witch or a hungry ogre or whatnot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353470/#Comment_353470" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-08T09:33:39+00:00" title="January  8, 2012  9:33AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's said above, but I'll say it again slightly differently: you don't prepare a plot, you prepare situation.  Prepare interesting NPCs for them to meet, prepare opponents, prepare places they may end up, think about what's going on in the world.  These don't need to be (and in fact probably shouldn't be) in any great detail.  Sometimes just a bullet list is fine.  What you want is something to look at for inspiration when your mind goes blank, and things you can use with/against your PCs without having to stop and figure them out in the middle of play.  As a bonus, I've found having done that sort of prep, it becomes much easier to improvise new stuff if nothing you prepared is right for the situation your players end up in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353519/#Comment_353519" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-09T01:55:22+00:00" title="January  9, 2012  1:55AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey,<br/><br/>I found out that I really like this method of scenario design, which helps me<br/>a) avoid railroading,<br/>b) but at the same time, be reasonably prepared for whatever players do.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.thealexandrian.net/creations/misc/node-design/node-design.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thealexandrian.net/creations/misc/node-design/node-design.html</a><br/><br/>There are more useful essays by the same guy here:<br/><a href="http://www.thealexandrian.net/creations/creations.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thealexandrian.net/creations/creations.html</a><br/><br/>And a series on "advanced node-based design" on his blog:<br/><a href="http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/8171/roleplaying-games/advanced-node-based-design-part-1-moving-between-nodes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/8171/roleplaying-games/advanced-node-based-design-part-1-moving-between-nodes</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

To that end there are two techniques I use all the time that may be useful to you:<br/><br/>1. Make sure that the characters all have really good reasons not to agree about everything. Build conflict and excitement into their relationships from the outset by making that an explicit goal during character generation. They don't have to be hated rivals, but they should have goals and outlooks that are different enough to cause interesting friction. Love and romance are fantastic for this, if your crew is game. Family is also great. Power, pride and ambition are close thirds. Ask your players to keep this in mind and help them find it through leading questions as they build their dudes. When in doubt, be somebody's sister! Have a secret crush on another character! Be that guy's rival! Keep the characters tightly bound together with this stuff. If you are running a one-shot or short campaign, you can build pre-gens, with your friends in mind, that are all pointed at each other.<br/><br/>2. Let your friends build the world for you - ask tons of questions all the time. "I don't know, what <i>does </i>it look like?" is the simplest, but you can ask them to give you plot details to: "He's dead, and it was obviously the work of a particular monster. Which one?" "She's carrying something that used to belong to you - what is it?" That sort of thing. You'll hear this called fishing or "the Mountain Witch trick" after a game that uses it heavily, but it is a very old technique and really fun once everybody gets used to it. When you get good at it, you can GM compelling, fun sessions with zero prep.<br/><br/>I think these two techniques would work well in addressing your three major concerns.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353706/#Comment_353706" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-10T06:03:52+00:00" title="January 10, 2012  6:03AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, understand that everyone at the game wants to have fun and wants you to succeed. So long as you don't do anything that really annoys the other people around the table, they'll have fun, which means you succeed. It's not a high-pressure situation, so don't worry about it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: dldzioba</cite><br/>What 3 specific things do you want help with? When you imagine what could go wrong, what is it?<br/>How to plan beyond the initial game, how to handle when the players take me by surprise, how to lead the game without railroading(if possible).<br/>Mostly I'm worried about being under prepared, that and the idea my players will decided to stay in the Grimm Lands, learn magic and run amuck.</blockquote>\nMy suggestions.<br/><br/>Don't plan beyond the initial game session. Instead, as others have said, create a few NPCs and think about what they want and what they'll do in response to the PCs actions. Make sure that many, if not all, of the NPCs desperately need something that only a PC can provide. Make many NPCs unreasonable, desperate people in dire situations. Then let them loose. Don't be afraid to put PCs in dire situations. Players enjoy finding ways to escape your inescapable death-traps.<br/><br/>When the players take you by surprise, acknowledge it, praise them for it, then take a moment to think about what happens next. There's a precedent for that already, so people will be expecting the occasional pause. Don't forget, you've got a lot of expertise around the table. You can use that. Ask for suggestions. (You can also ask players to describe the world and to play NPCs for you.)<br/><br/>I wouldn't try to lead the game. Instead, look for places where the players can make interesting decisions for their characters. If there aren't any interesting decisions to be made, move on until there are.<br/><br/>If you're under-prepared, so what? Stop when you've got as far as you're comfortable with. Better to have a great but short session than try to string it out into something longer but boring. In any case, players always get through far less game than you expect, so I doubt that it'll be a problem.<br/><br/>If a PC decides to stay in Grimm, great!

Usually I had at least ten typed pages of plot and npc's, mostly plot, and it often led to either my throwing the plot out the window, or railroading the players. Then I went in the opposite direction and prepared absolutely nothing, winged it all. Sometimes it was amazing, more often it sucked.<br/>\nWhat took me about 15 years to learn was to let go. Let the players influence the story in a big way, not just in the way I envisioned. Do light planning. Plan a few npc's and the start of the plot, then let the players run with it, because if you've planned for 10 different possible directions following an encounter, I can guarantee you the players will choose number 11+<br/>\nAfter years of playing Gurps, WoD, Call of Cthulhu and other, more mainstream games, I ran my very first episode of Primetime Adventures. My players ran with it, and pretty much all my ideas were shot to hell. This was a good thing. The mystery they came up with was far superior and emotionally engaging than what I'd come up with. Had this been a few years ago, I'd have over-ruled the players and the experience as a whole would likely have suffered for it. Another bonus is, of course, that I can now re-use my idea. Much less planning for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353929/#Comment_353929" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T11:16:49+00:00" title="January 11, 2012 11:16AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: dldzioba</cite><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><br/>2.

I only checked into this thread to see if someone had mentioned this technique, and Jason explained it perfectly. Your mind is blown now, isn't it? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> The first time a GM did it to me, I was so amazed that I forgot everything else that happened in that game, and just wandered around in a daze for a few hours afterwards. I've run whole sessions on nothing else, where my contribution was limited to prompting, which still gave me plenty of creative input, and then enjoying everyone's details and characterizations. I really like it when being the GM doesn't limit the possibility of being surprised.<br/><br/>Anyway, as Jason also said, it's nice because it means you, as the GM, can be a little lazier, so it's the best friend of long campaigns. It's also great because it increases buy-in and consensus, and gets everyone involved. Just make sure to take notes! If you can take notes where everyone can see them, like on a whiteboard or an easel pad, so much the better. A related technique is to offer a little XP (or other reward token) bonus at the beginning of each session for player(s) summarizing the events of the last session. Generally, that will get the contributor of each important detail to speak up and repeat it, which helps it live into later sessions.<br/><br/>Also, let me commend you for putting work into the initial setup. You don't have to do it all by yourself but (again amplifying Jason's suggestion) getting everyone onto the same page about the state of the fiction at the very beginning is just about the most useful thing you can do. If you can get them onto the same page and make sure that the characters have things to fight about as well as against, that will make the characters more real, too, since they'll have distinct interests to assert. Every pair of real people has some non-overlapping interests, and by bringing some into sharp focus from the beginning, you'll breathe extra life into your guys.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353970/#Comment_353970" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T14:05:52+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  2:05PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 11, 2012 4:32PM by ccreitz.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, one other thing.

Do you see how Jamie, the GM, took the player's (arguable) abuse of the rule in stride, and together they turned it into a great detail in the fiction? He was able to do that because he hadn't established a million facts about "how vampirism works". When we come to the table, and establish that nothing is true until we agree to assert it into the fiction (or because it's a consequence of the mechanics), that's a style called "no myth", and it has a lot to recommend it. So, as another piece of laziness-oriented advice, I'd say that you should try to leave a lot of the world undefined, so that all of the players have a chance to paint on a big canvas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dldzioba" title="dldzioba"><img alt="dldzioba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dldzioba">dldzioba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354393/#Comment_354393" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-15T18:20:03+00:00" title="January 15, 2012  6:20PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for pointing me in the direction of that. :)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355476">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355476/#Comment_355476" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T11:44:27+00:00" title="January 23, 2012 11:44AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Dominique!<br/><br/>Here's some more advice for you:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: dldzioba</cite>Mostly I'm worried about being under prepared, that and the idea my players will decided to stay in the Grimm Lands, learn magic and run amuck.</blockquote>\nYou're worried they'll stay in the Grimm lands, but that's not what the game is about? <br/><br/>1. Make it clear up front: "This game will be about children trying to escape a weird fantasy in order to return to their real lives."<br/><br/>2. Get each player to buy in to this concept personally. During character generation, make sure each one answers a few questions like these:<br/><br/>* "What part of your regular, everyday life do you love most?"<br/>* "Why do you want to get home? What do you miss about your family the most?"<br/>* "What's wrong with your family right now, and why do they need your help?"<br/><br/>Once they create those answers, they'll have a personal attachment to them: they will want to get home, because they created their characters in such a way that they wish they could get home. However, if they DO decide to give up on "going home", it'll be really meaningful and important and INTERESTING, because we all know what they're giving up to do so. Which is a win too!<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: dldzioba</cite>How to plan beyond the initial game, how to handle when the players take me by surprise, how to lead the game without railroading(if possible).</blockquote>\nOne great method I would recommend would be to create a handful of "story elements" for your Grimm setting. Most of these should be characters, but they could also be locations or objects. If they aren't people, create people connected to them, or figure out how you can treat them like people (e.g. a forest that seems to have a personality, likes certain characters over others, etc.).<br/><br/>You can come up with these on your own, or pick the players' brains. ("What's your favourite fairy tale?" "What scares you about it the most?" etc.)<br/><br/>* Decide how each element is related to at least two of the other elements. <br/><br/>Say you have a Witch, a Dark Forest, and a Goblin Baker. Well, maybe the Forest is deathly scared of the Witch, and wants her to disappear. And the Witch is in love with the Goblin Baker, and wishes she could make him fall in love with her and accept her. The Goblin Baker, in the meantime, is killing human children and burying them in the Dark Forest so no one will ever find them, and uses their hearts to bake his famous pies.<br/><br/>* Give each element some kind of connection to the "way out" (in your case, it's Sleeping Beauty), so that when the players interact with that element, they'll learn something about her: where she is, her backstory, whatever. <br/><br/>Let'say the Witch hates her and made her fall asleep. The Dark Forest wants to hide her body from everyone except Prince Charming. And the Baker lusts after her, and is trying to find her.<br/><br/>* Finally, and most importantly, now create a really important reason for each element to want something from the children. Make it serious: maybe even desperate. <br/><br/>The Witch wants the Baker to fall in love with her, but thinks she is too ugly for him. Therefore, she thinks the children are her gateway into his heart, because:<br/><br/>a) They come from the real world and know about makeup and fashion, or maybe<br/>b) she wants to capture them so she can offer them to the Baker for his unusual pies.<br/><br/>(Depending on how light-hearted your game is!)<br/><br/>Create a similar strong motive for each "element". Each one MUST want or need something from the children!<br/><br/>Now, finally, you can just play. They tell you where they go and what they do. For each "thing" they encounter, they will find some interesting information pointing them at another thing, and all leading towards the "way out". (Don't hide this information, give it to them when they encounter it!) And anytime you're not sure what to do next, have the element they're currently interacting with take action in a serious way to get what he or she wants from the children. (For instance, the Witch would probably try to capture them and sell them to the Baker.)<br/><br/>And you're ready to go! No waster prep, all useful play material, and you'll always have something interesting to say or do. Whenever you're unsure, ask them provocative questions. ("What's the scariest story you've ever heard about the Witch? What is she rumoured to have done?")<br/><br/>Let me know if you have any questions, and be sure to tell us how it goes!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
