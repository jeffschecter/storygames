                    I've placed this in Praxis! because I feel that it represents a different way to market or design games. I could be wrong. Anywho, I'm currently reading Brian Greene's <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375727205/sr=8-1/qid=1142870714/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-3867854-5363242?%5Fencoding=UTF8" rel="nofollow">The Fabric of the Cosmos</a></span>, and I came across a few passages that I found relevant to story games, in general:
<blockquote><p>...imagine you are an art collector and Mr. Smithers, chairman of the new Springfield Art and Beautification Society, is coming to look at various works you have put up for sale. You know, however, that his real interest is in <i>The Full Monty</i>, a painting in your collection that you never felt quite fit, but one that was left to you by your beloved great-uncle Monty Burns, so that deciding whether to sell it is quite an emotional struggle. After Mr. Smithers arrives, you talk about your collection, recent auctions, the current show at the Metropolitan; suprisingly, you learn that, years back, Smithers was your great-uncle's top aide. By the end of the conversation you decided that you are willing to part with <i>The Full Monty</i>: There are so many othe works you want, and you must exercise restraint or your collection will have no focus. In the world of art collecting, you have always told yourself, sometimes more is less.</p>
As you reflect up on this decision, in retrospect it seems that you have actually already decided to sell before Mr. Smithers arrived. ... Even though you remember that before your visitor's arrival you had been thinking that you didn't know what to do, from your current vantage point it seems you really did. ... The future has helped you tell a more complete story of what was going on in the past.<br/>...But if you hadn't gotten on so well with Mr. Smithers, ... you might very well have decided not to sell. And the story of the past that you might tell in this situation could easily involve a recognition that you'd actually decided long ago <i>not</i> to sell ... The actual past, of course, did not change one bit. Yet a different experience now would lead you to describe a different history. ... Both stories are valid. Both stories are interesting. They just describe different situations.</blockquote>
<br/>Doesn't that just scream stakes resolution? Maybe I'm just seeing things that aren't there, but it really struck me that the text above was a neat way to restate resolution of stakes where both stakes are interesting to the players involved.<br/><br/><br/>If you want to know how this relates to quantum physics, let me know.                </div>

                            Two things: This is really interesting and not really related to gaming as such.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest reading The Science of Discworld II: The Globe, for a discourse of Narrative Causality, Cause and Effect and how they relate. This has many effects on Narrativism and game Physiocs.<br/>
Also read Story of your Life that appears in a collection bearing the same name by Ted Chiang. It uses the "Light going through two mediums chooses the shortest route", but that requires the light to know the route before beginning to travel as a basis. I could spoil both sources but they are best to be read.                        </div>

                            Wow. When I start in on my playtest, I do believe I shall be giving my players a copy of this. That has also rounded off some corners of my perception on this subject, in terms of looking on that kind of resolution without thinking of it in terms of mechanics, which will in turn help me explain this better, I hope.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, random squee-ing aside, are you offering explanations of how stakes resolution relates to quantum mechanics or how the example does? Either way, I would be interested in seeing your explanation to see if my understanding of such things jives in a semi-proper manner.<br/>

                            Okay, here's how the experiment that this related to worked (and I'll try to extrapolate, feel free to comment or bash - I'm horrible with theory).<br/><br/>Imagine a big electron gun in the middle of a room, a plate with two slits, and a wall that will note the impact of electrons on it. The gun fires a beam of electrons at the plate, and electrons can only move past the plate if they go through a slit (or go through the slits).<br/><br/>A similar experiment is a big photon gun, a silvered mirror, two regular mirrors, and a wall that will note the impact of photons on it. The silvered mirror will force individual photons to move to the left or allow passage straight through; the two regular mirrors will bounce the photons to the same point on the wall.<br/><br/>When particles like electrons or photons are forced to 'make a choice' i.e. move through one of two directions/methods, one of two things happen:<br/><br/>Situation 1) The electrons/photons act as waves, and you will see an interference pattern will emerge. It will look like a barcode, with straight parallel lines.<br/><br/>Situation 2) The electrons/photons act as particles, and they would impact like a bullet.<br/><br/>What causes the two different situations? Observation. If you set up a device to detect which route the electron/photon took, it will always act as Situation 2. If you turn off the detector, it will revert to Situation 1. Or, if you don't have a detector at all, it will follow Situation 1. Here's the crux: You can set up the detector after the split/forced decision occurs, and you will still get the same results. The future (detection by a machine) forces the electron/photon to act differently in the past (act as a particle/act as a wave).<br/><br/>So, the electron/photon gun: All that occurs previously to force out something interesting. So, Social Contract, Situation, etc. (Right?)<br/><br/>The sheet with slits/Silvered Mirror: The thing that forces that interesting thing to make a decision, or forces us to make a decision, whether Implicitly (Slitted Sheet - say that five times fast) or Explicitly (Silvered Mirror). So, Implicit Stakes Declaration or Explicit Stakes Declaration, usually (and I say this casually) being Task Resolution and Conflict Resolution systems.<br/><br/>Detectors, after the Slitted Sheet/Silvered Mirror (i.e., after the decision point): System (Right?)<br/><br/>So, tear it apart, make it anew. Did I make sense?                        </div>

                            Detectors are us.

                            Having taken a lot of quantum physics - three undergrad courses and four at the graduate level - and found it very interesting and "fun" (as fun as infinite sequences of complete sets of functions get), I feel like most of the terminology we have these days simply doesn't apply to quantum physics. Is it a wave or particle? Not a valid question. The terms "wave" and "particle" are for limiting cases only. Where is the electron? Not a valid question - there are no trajectories. It's like saying "what would you see if you went at the speed of light;" it simply doesn't apply.<br/>
<br/>
The big question for quantum in my mind is, "What counts as an observer?" If we could possibly answer that, or even formulate the question correctly, I think we'd have a lot more conceptual understanding of what really <i>happens</i> at that level.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, what you've described doesn't really seem like quantum physics, in my mind. A different path leading to the same result is just day-to-day life. If <i>asking the person, at the time, what they were thinking</i> changed their behavior utterly, that would be like the experiment you described.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents.                        </div>

<blockquote>I just got enraptured with the author referring to the future dictacting the past and calling it the 'story'.</blockquote>
Interestingly enough, Scott Adams wrote a ton of this kind of thing in "The Dilbert Future".  In fact, that WHOLE BOOK was pretty much nothing more than The Dummy's Guide to Psychology and Quantum Physics/Mechanics".  When I got to the part about the future dictating the events of the past, that part really stewed my juices. Still does, even, today.<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></div>
