About two year ago, I ran and finished a pretty epic game of Ghost.Echo. I spent a lot of time with the game, developing an entire world and economy around the Ghost mechanic. I called the setting Purgatory.<br/><br/>Since then, I've been going back through the game and novelizing it. I have some connections in the publishing world and may one day actually be able to get this published, assuming that I have John Harper's permission and blessing. I would love to see more attention brought to Ghost.Echoe and John's other works of art (if I may be so bold).<br/><br/>In the meantime, I thought I'd post the rough drafts here as I write them, in case anyone is interested. Right now the plan would be to post new updates weekly or maybe bi-weekly. I've been writing about a thousand words a day and am going to try to keep that up. I don't want to promise I'll stick to that schedule, you never know what's going to happen in life, but I will promise to keep posting for as long as the project is active and interest remains.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that this hasn't seen an edit yet.<br/><br/>UPDATE! As of February 22nd, I am hosting the writing on Fan Fiction, because it is easier to read for everyone. I'm also hoping it gets people interested in Ghost.Echoe. I will update this thread to let you know when new chapters are up.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036607/1/Two-Sides-of-Midnight" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036607/1/Two-Sides-of-Midnight</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zippdementia" title="zippdementia"><img alt="zippdementia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zippdementia">zippdementia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406485/#Comment_406485" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-18T00:23:58+00:00" title="February 18, 2013 12:23AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2013 9:38AM by zippdementia.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Prelude to Purgatory</b><br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Her shoulders pushed up against the cold stone of the building, her head resting back upon its cushion of black hair. She could feel the small bob that she'd tied it into pressed against her neck like a hand poised to give her a massage. Water dripped into her eyes, blurring her vision so that she couldn't see the rain; she felt where it splashed against her skin and began to eat into her make up. She imagined the layers of paint dropping off of her cheeks as white tear drops. Passing her tongue over her rain-soaked lips, she tasted gasoline and vinegar.<br/><br/>The adrenaline was rushing upon her and no amount of acid rain could burn it away. She tried to tone down her emotions, to merely be uncomfortable. She could feel the cold of the building through the thin, purple, coat that clung tightly to her back. She forced herself to keep her eyes open and to let the rain burn them. Though none of these bodily sensations were pleasant, they were all better than that sense of slipping out of her skin against her will, of slowly losing her body, that always followed the use of her powers.<br/><br/>An airwhale passed above her and for an instant the little street was illuminated by its blinding spotlight. Anyala raised her hand to block it out; a hand soaked in a red that glimmered slickly under the light. Then the ship passed, leaving Purgatory, heading to either MidCity or the Peripheries on some unknown errand. Her thoughts stayed with it, and for the passing of a moment she felt she might be able to drift away with it, a virtual stowaway. Her stomach lurched as if she had stepped off a precipice and she was sure she was going to phase out. Then her ear vibrated with the hollow echo of static. It was like having a glass pressed over her ear with a fly trapped inside of it. The buzz made her cringe but also brought her back to herself. She reached up her left hand and rubbed her earlobe between two slender fingers, adjusting the volume of the implanted chip.<br/><br/>\u201cI thought we were on radio silence.\u201d Her voice was a whisper lost in the clatter of the rain against the steel street and the pounding of music through the wall behind her, the result of a shrill horn blasting a solo in a crazed jazz riff.<br/><br/>\u201cA pointless precaution. The Covens are blind outside of the core.\u201d .ZHAR\u2019s voice carried subtle arrogance. <br/><br/>\u201cJust checking in.\u201d That was .GREP, and she felt her heartbeat slow as she listened to his familiar level tones. \u201cI\u2019m with .SORT at The Watchtower. The rift will be opening in a few minutes.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI\u2019m ready to go when you are,\u201d .ZHAR said. \u201cFound a little rift loop at the canals. It\u2019s a tidy little thing. You should see what it\u2019s doing to the water.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201c.CAI, where are you?\u201d<br/><br/>Anyala, known in the city of Midnight as .CAI, wiped a thin sheet of the toxic rain away from her eyelids and blinked blurrily at the neon sign flickering above her head.<br/><br/>\u201cHobknobs,\u201d she said. \u201cEdge of the dead zone. I\u2019m a block from The Watchtower.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cDid everything go alright?\u201d<br/><br/>She looked down at a dark shape at her feet, crumpled against the wall of the abandoned bar.<br/><br/>\u201cMore or less. He didn\u2019t recognize me at first, thought I was a street walker. It was over fast.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cGood. Get over here as soon as you can. .ZHAR, make sure you contact us again before you rift. I want to coordinate this.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cMan, I\u2019ve been rifting since before you first got pulled in kicking and screaming to the Ghost World. Don\u2019t wait up for me.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cNext time, stick to the plan. I don\u2019t like making separate jumps if we don\u2019t have to.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cI thought <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23STRIKERS&amp;Mode=like">#STRIKERS</a> had more balls than that.\u201d<br/><br/>.GREP ignored him.<br/><br/>\u201c.CAI, get here soon. The rift is gonna be open in a few minutes.\u201d<br/><br/>With a quickly uncomfortable burst of static, .GREP broke the connection.<br/><br/>.CAI pulled herself away from the building, flexing her red hands. Looking back, she saw a dark black stain streaking down where she\u2019d been leaning, running down towards the body of the man she\u2019d killed. The unnatural rain was washing out her dye. She reached up and undid the bun of hair, letting it fall across her shoulders. It would stain her coat, ruining it, but she didn\u2019t care. She needed a new coat anyway. After tonight\u2019s encounter, this one now had a tear along the side from where the traitor had rushed at her with a knife after<br/><br/><i>he had seen the scar above her right eye and maybe she had been too cocky in not covering it up with some kind of makeup because he had known then and had had time to draw the knife before she could react</i><br/><br/>he\u2019d realized who she was and why she was there. That same knife was now buried in his sternum. She\u2019d seen<br/><br/><i>a street walker. A young girl with black hair tied up in a cute bun. And after all, why not? Wasn\u2019t that why he came here every week? The place was known for street walkers. It was just that they weren\u2019t usually this young or this attractive. And this one was dressed almost demurely, with that buttoned up purple coat and the skirt that fell down to right below her knees. Long for a street walker, young for a street walker, cute for a street walker. She could be making much more money in Purgatory than in an abandoned zone. But then he had felt something different tonight, that something good was going to come his way. He wasn\u2019t usually picky, but he\u2019d turned down the first three walkers he\u2019d seen tonight. And this was his reward for his patience. He imagined that black hair loose and falling over his thighs while she serviced him, one of his hands wrapped through it, caressing the fine shape of her skull. He moved forward to taste those large sensuous lips, and his eye strayed to her one imperfection, a tear shaped discoloration above her right eye</i><br/><br/>the knife flash in his hand and had barely had time to turn the slashing wrist aside before she heard the sound of ripping and the knife had torn into her coat instead of skin.<br/><br/><i>that\u2019s why I skipped over the first three. Ghost bitch planted the thought in my head, she ensorceled me. Bitch can\u2019t weight more than a hundred pounds. I\u2019ll slice her open and spill those Witch guts all over the pavement</i><br/><br/> .CAI shook her head to clear it. The man\u2019s thoughts were rushing over her like cars passing by on a busy highway. She leaned close to the body, held a hand close to the slack mouth. Sure enough, she could feel a slight warm breath against her palm<br/><br/><i>how did she move so fast that should have cut her from hip to neck and how did she have a grip like that and oh god how was she pushing the knife back towards him, towards his own chest and then he was knocked off his feet, thrown against the side of the building, and the knife was pushing its way into his sternum and his muscles were relaxing and contracting and the ramen he\u2019d had that afternoon was emptying itself into his pants and she was pulling away still alive</i><br/><br/>.CAI drove one palm hard into the handle of the knife, driving it sideways and deeper, piercing the man\u2019s heart and ending the deluge of his thoughts in her mind.<br/><br/> \u201cThat\u2019s for .HULL,\u201d she said and spat on the traitor.<br/><br/>Moments later, the alley was empty except for the body. Only the black streak on the wall marked that .CAI had ever been there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zippdementia" title="zippdementia"><img alt="zippdementia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zippdementia">zippdementia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406486/#Comment_406486" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-18T00:24:43+00:00" title="February 18, 2013 12:24AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2<br/><br/>The metropolis of Midnight is a sprawl. It sits upon the frozen earth as a black blemish, a gigantic circle enclosed on most sides by the Heavenly Peaks and, beyond that, the icy wastes. If there ever was a world, the wastes are what is left of it. At the center of the circle lies Purgatory, the very pulse of Midnight. Here ingeniously designed skyscrapers twist metallic girders and glass faces into the sky; here cars built to fit some lost aesthetic drive the lengths of ever-decaying highways; here is constant noise and chatter as the majority of Midnight\u2019s inhabitants work themselves to death, or entertain themselves into a placated acceptance of life. The noise, if you listen carefully from the right spot, is sometimes broken by the howl of one of the Tall Men.<br/><br/>The rest of Midnight can be defined as thus: the Peripheries, which are the outer ring closest to the frozen Heavenly Peaks and the icy wastes; MidCity, which is most everything else encompassed in a sort of nightmare suburbia; and the dead zones, places of abandonment sprinkled throughout the city with no order or reason. It was in one of these dead zones, one of the only ones inside Purgatory\u2014rare for a dead zone to appear there, and a continual source of anxiety to those who lived within view of it\u2014that a certain traitor of the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23STRIKERS&amp;Mode=like">#STRIKERS</a> had gone for a quick fix of the flesh and had instead ended up with his own knife embedded in his heart outside of a bar called Hobknobs which played live jazz music all night long, the louder the better.<br/><br/>This dead zone was special. It contained The Watchtower, and The Watchtower contained a rift that activated at exactly 11:59pm and 12:01pm every night, on either side of midnight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zippdementia" title="zippdementia"><img alt="zippdementia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zippdementia">zippdementia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406487/#Comment_406487" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-18T00:26:55+00:00" title="February 18, 2013 12:26AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2013 12:32PM by zippdementia.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            3<br/><br/>The stairs went up the watchtower in a stoic square pattern, hugging each wall like the stairwell of an hotel. CAI took the wide steps three at a time and was breathing heavily when she reached the third landing. Only seventeen more stories to go, she thought. The Watchtower was an anomaly in a city whose towers and skyscrapers were defined by black metal, blue super carbon, silver titanium, and shimmering glass. It was brown brick and gray mortar, but more than that, it was brick and mortar which dared to jut into the sky. Like an ancient Tower of Babel, it mocked the more modern structures. I can rise, too, it seemed to say, and I don\u2019t need your fancy super carbon to stay up. The fact that it didn\u2019t reach as high as the true skyscrapers didn\u2019t take away from its solemn grandeur.<br/><br/>Antique lamps lined the staircase and some flickered with ghostly light, shining on the rotten bits of carpet that still clung to the concrete steps like hair on a rotting skull. Huge ragged holes in the walls served as windows onto the city scape, which came steadily into view the further .CAI climbed. Sometimes the effect was disconcerting. She would round a corner, feel a blast of cool air, and find herself staring out into nothing. The worst part was near the eighteenth story, where a whole wall had collapsed, leaving only the staircase framed by abyss on either side. To her right was a dark pit lit only by the pale lamps, giving her a dim view of the stairs spiraling away towards the ground. To her left was the inner city of Midnight; Purgatory, with its lights spread out like a blanket of stars that had fallen from the sky. It was early, yet. A little past midnight, those lights would later be joined by six actual stars, the only stars that still cared to shine over the city. No matter how much light the city polluted the night with, those stars would still be brightly visible. Far in the distance, the Uni-Crown stood like the finger of God, the tallest building in the city. <br/><br/>.CAI came upon this treacherous opening at a small sprint, and caught herself just in time to avoid running out into the open air. She fell to her knees on the last step before the opening. This hole hadn\u2019t been here the last time. The Watchtower, like everything else in Midnight, was slowly falling apart. She made the mistake of looking down over the edge and immediately felt herself sway forward with vertigo. She pulled back slowly and shakily got to her feet.<br/><br/>As she stood up, she felt something pulse through her and she dropped to her knees again before the sensation could topple her over the edge of the staircase. It was a rift opening close by, and she felt it in the same way that someone else might hear and interpret a sound muffled through a plaster wall. It was 11:59, then. She had two minutes to reach the top of the tower and catch the last rift out of Midnight. She didn\u2019t have time to be careful. <br/><br/>.CAI leapt to her feet in a single smooth motion and began to sprint again, not thinking about the emptiness to either side of her, not looking at the dents and bits of carpet on the staircase waiting to snag and trip her, letting her feet go to where they needed without thinking about it. And like that, she was up two more floors, where the stairs ended in a small room that may have once been used for maintenance. Spare gears and levers lay scattered around the lamp-lit room, but whatever machine they had powered was long gone. Here a ladder led to a trapdoor in the ceiling. It was open and a light shone down through it. <br/><br/>Her pale hands closed around the bottom rungs of the ladder. She gritted her teeth at the unpleasant feel of the rust rubbing against her palms and began to climb. She was panting loudly as she climbed and a short laugh drifted down to her as her passage was marked.<br/><br/>\u201cTold ya she\u2019d make it.\u201d<br/><br/>The outline of .GREP\u2019s lean upper body and his wiry face appeared framed in the trapdoor. He reached down a hand. She took it gratefully and let him help her up the last bit of the way.<br/><br/>.GREP grunted as he pulled her into the highest room of the watchtower. It was little more than four arches which supported a roof and which had once held four massive stained-glass faces in each arch. Now only one remained, and it was covered with so much grime that whatever the image had been was indecipherable. An ornate chandelier hung from the roof, it\u2019s lights blaring almost offensively against the gloom, throwing shadows everywhere. <br/><br/>\u201cMe and the kid had a bet,\u201d .GREP said, his features stretching to accommodate his dimpled smile. His brown eyes met her own teal ones in silent greeting.<br/><br/>The \u2018kid\u2019 in question, .SORT, walked into the light, towering over .GREP. \u201cWhich you lost,\u201d he said earnestly. His own chiseled features betrayed none of .GREP\u2019s amusement, though she sensed he wasn\u2019t adverse to a game as long as there was a chance for him to claim victory. <br/><br/>.GREP shrugged at her. \u201cI said you\u2019d be here by the first rift.\u201d He turned back to .SORT and pointed in mock accusation. \u201cBut you said she wouldn\u2019t make it at all, so I was closer to right. You owe me a beer.\u201d<br/><br/>.CAI\u2019s eyes strayed to .GREP\u2019s outstretched arm. They all had their scars, and .GREP\u2019s extended up his right arm in a pall of warped flesh, disappearing into his tight muscle shirt. A Wraith had caught him on the Planes and ripped a chunk out of his Ghost. .CAI had been able to heal the wound, but never the scar.<br/><br/>.GREP looked back at her. \u201cI like your new look,\u201d he quipped, nodding at .CAI\u2019s hair. \u201cTrying to copy me?\u201d Her hair that had been black on the street, black as .GREP\u2019s was naturally, was now a gross mixture of green and gray where the color was draining out, and a glaring platinum blonde where it was already gone.<br/><br/>\u201cYeah,\u201d .CAI said, her voice lathered in sarcasm. \u201cThought I\u2019d try being ugly for a day, see how you do it.\u201d<br/><br/>But .GREP was already turning away, touching his ear and radioing .ZHAR to tell him to get ready to jump. .CAI wondered how long they had. Twenty seconds? Thirty? How close had .GREP come to losing that bet? .SORT had stalked towards one of the arches and now stood with his hands in the pockets of his slacks, his open trench coat and shaggy brown hair blowing in the wind.<br/><br/>Barely a dozen seconds passed before she felt the rift wash over them. Stray pebbles and bits of granite on the dirty watchtower floor trembled and jittered, as stones sometimes do when a train passes by. She saw .GREP phase out. He walked towards a sizable suitcase in the shadows; he gripped the handle and then it was like he and the suitcase melded into the dark. She didn\u2019t see .SORT go. The pull had always been strong for her and she went almost immediately after .GREP left. With a tug at her midriff, she phased out of Midnight and into the Ghost World.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zippdementia" title="zippdementia"><img alt="zippdementia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zippdementia">zippdementia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406643/#Comment_406643" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-19T13:04:43+00:00" title="February 19, 2013  1:04PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (quick note, I went back and adjusted some minor details in the last section to tie in here. Like the suitcase. Also fixed a couple minor character details.)<br/><br/><b>Blitzing in the Undercross</b><br/><br/>1<br/><br/>The moment they arrived in the //Undercross//, .GREP knew something was wrong. They all did. .ZHAR was already there, his human-shaped Ghost a shimmering plum color. In the four months he\u2019d known him, .GREP had learned that when .ZHAR\u2019s Ghost turned dark like that, the man was concerned.<br/><br/>.CAI phased in shortly after, a shimmer of pale blue out of the corner of his eye. Her concern was a little easier to interpret. \u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d<br/><br/>Her voice echoed loudly in the unfamiliar tunnel that stretched out before them. .SORT phased in as her outburst made its last repetition, appearing about thirty feet in front of him. Or at least, it looked like thirty feet.<br/><br/>The nature of the Ghost World, sometimes called the Planes, was such that senses could sometimes become confused. Like the Ghosts themselves, the Ghost World seemed to have physical form. There were objects and structures. Some Ghosts could even phase in with other objects, like the suitcase .GREP still held in his right hand. There was gravity: things could fall in the Ghost World. If they fell from high enough, they broke. There were sounds, and smells, and certain places that were warmer or colder than others, yet none of these things were experienced in the way that we are used to in reality. <br/><br/>Ghosts themselves looked like human figures pulsing with color, which flowed through miniscule veins. Close up, you could see the veins like the thinnest roots of a flower; from a little further back, the effect looked like a solid whole. Ghosts didn\u2019t have feature, but their emotions created the feeling of features. A Ghost could frown, for instance, and though nothing in the blank tumble of energy that made up her face would change, anyone looking at her would <i>see</i> the frown.<br/><br/>A Ghost might recognize that she was cold without feeling discomfort or stand somewhere that she knew was dark and yet have no trouble seeing. She might even (if she had the proper mental control) decide to challenge gravity and walk up the side of one of the Ghost World's many buildings. Even more disturbing, the bundles of energy that formed her feet into accurate representations of human heels and toes would <i>make the sounds of footsteps</i> as she walked up the building. It was like being in a broken video game, one where the rules were partial to change if you spoke to them in the right tone of voice.<br/><br/>Sometimes even the simple perception of being in one place could become blurred and unfocused, like a memory someone is trying to recall. At those moments, entire journeys could seem to go by in an instant, though miles of "physical" land had been traveled. This phenomenon was called blitzing and it was particularly prevalent in the winding tunnels of the //Undercross//, which was why so many Ghosts used it for quick traveling on the Planes. Spending too long in the Ghost World could drain a person to dangerous limits. If those limits were crossed, a Ghost would fade entirely, becoming part of that boundless energy, and the psyche of the user would return to the aether. It happened, oh yes. It happened more often than most covens wished to admit. Sometimes a coven of four or five Ghosts would go into the Planes and, if they stayed too long, only three or four would come back. Never mind what part of the human mind created a Ghost; whatever it was, it was an essential part of making it back to reality. If it dissipated, so did the person. Because of this, getting around the Planes fast was desirable, and the //Undercross// was an essential tool for getting it done.<br/><br/>The place resembled something out of 1950's New York; a sprawling grand central station made up of ancient architecture and filled with odd knick-knacks, such as a gigantic clock that seemed to change its time at random. It could best be described as the subway system for the Planes, though most Ghosts preferred not to stray into its vast tunnels and networks except to blitz. There were no rifts in the //Undercross// to offer quick escape back to Midnight, and no one knew how far the tunnels extended. <br/><br/>New York, Grand Central Station, subways\u2026 these things survived as pictures in dusty coffee-table tomes (.GREP\u2019s mother had owned one when he was a child), informing a cultural memory that no one living had actually ever experienced. Or maybe a very few had, but that comes much later in the story. For now, suffice it to say that the four <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Strikers&amp;Mode=like">#Strikers</a>, led by .GREP, were all given a nasty jolt when they suddenly came out of their blitz. A quick look around told them that they hadn't reached their destination. .SOURCE had said he would meet them in the //Undercross\u2019// main station by the clock. They were still in the tunnels and Heaven only knew which section of tunnels, or how many levels underneath the main station these were.<br/><br/>It was unheard of: a blitz halting in the middle of the tunnels. That was what the tunnels were used for, to get from point A to point B. What was in between A and B? The Ghosts looked around at the bend of the tunnel that they were in, its sloped sides arching over them into a roof that was more suffocating than comforting. There was forward and back and not much else to see.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zippdementia" title="zippdementia"><img alt="zippdementia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zippdementia">zippdementia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406685/#Comment_406685" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-20T00:00:54+00:00" title="February 20, 2013 12:00AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2013 12:01AM by zippdementia.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2<br/><br/>.GREP didn't have time to be curious, analyze, or even think\u2014in unfamiliar territory, it was instinct which kicked in. In the Ghost World, tenths of a second separated life and death. As soon as the last member of his team appeared, he reached out telepathically, which felt a little like trying to shout your thoughts inside your head. Thinking, but louder, was how .SOURCE had always described it, but that did nothing to capture how unpleasant it was.<br/><br/><i>Formation Iota!</i><br/><br/>Formation Iota was a close-order arrangement to provide cover for the less combat-driven Ghosts; .GREP played rear guard, .ZHAR moved in front, .SORT and .CAI stood next to each other in the middle. .GREP scanned the area behind him, tapping into his powers of multi-spectral vision. In the real world, .GREP had read flowery writers who would metaphorically say a character \u201ccast\u201d their vision around an area. Now, .GREP literally cast his vision behind him, the way he might throw a baseball or cast a fishing line. His sight zoomed at high speed through the walls of the tunnel's curve and <br/><br/><i>long straight-away, down which he can see the movement of several life forms. They are indistinct in his enhanced vision, like trying to see forms through a shroud, but they are moving along the walls and ceilings, which is a bad sign. .ZHAR will have to confirm what they are<br/></i><br/>a moment later he gestured with his free hand and sent a thought to .ZHAR. <i>There, multiple marks behind us, possibly hostile. What d\u2019ya pick up?</i> As he thought it, cringing at the feeling the telepathy left in his mind, like a bass vibration running through his brain, .GREP set down the briefcase and knelt in front of it, quickly clicking it open.<br/><br/>3<br/><br/><i>.ZHAR, search for patterns!</i><br/><br/>The translated thought hit .ZHAR as a simple command. Telepathy was not an exact science and relied as much on the receiver to be unbiased as it did the sender to be accurate. As he obeyed the order, scanning the tunnel around them, .ZHAR felt his Ghost flush a brighter purple for a moment before settling back to its usual dim glow. It was not irritation, but simply... contempt? The change was unavoidable\u2014his Ghost control was not always on par with his physical self-control, although the signs were more confusing here in the Planes, anyway. .GREP would catch the flash, of that he was sure, but would think little of it. The man was observant\u2014.ZHAR had to give him that much\u2014but in an efficient sort of way. If the data wasn\u2019t immediately relevant, he put it aside.<br/><br/>Expanding his mind out, .ZHAR searched for the hot embers of energy that usually signified other beings, as well as searching for the tiny boxed sparks that his mind associated with the presence of energy fields. It was routine by<br/> <br/><i>sense life forms approaching from not far behind: based on their speed, they will be upon us in about a minute. Behind them, much further back down the tunnel, there is a much larger presence proceeding towards us. It will take longer to arrive<br/></i><br/>now, and came to him without much effort or focus.<br/><br/>4<br/><br/>Even as she spoke, .CAl stepped to the side and got in her position, almost before .GREP ordered them into formation. She had paid close attention to his lessons and memorized his normal tactical patterns months ago. A net of defensive energies reflexively constructed itself around the four Ghosts, borrowing energy from her form. The net had very little energy in it\u2014just enough to hold itself up and provide a framework for her to channel more energy through in case she needed to defend the group against an attack. The technique was one she had worked hard to memorize and perfect so that it wouldn't hinder the other Ghosts\u2019 sensing powers. That done, she glanced about the //Undercross// passageway, seemingly unperturbed, though she frowned when .GREP began futzing with his briefcase. She knew what that meant.<br/><br/>"Well it's definitely a goddamn Monday," she said dryly. "Someone see something I don't?"<br/><br/>Despite the casual confidence in her voice, she felt fear scuttling around inside her. The //Undercross// was her least favorite part of the Ghost World. She had been in these tunnels for a long time once, and had nearly died. The memory stuck with her, and although she didn't let her discomfort show to the group, she couldn\u2019t keep herself from hearing her own sobs drift out of the dark tunnels ahead of them.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zippdementia" title="zippdementia"><img alt="zippdementia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zippdementia">zippdementia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406951/#Comment_406951" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-22T12:02:48+00:00" title="February 22, 2013 12:02PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2013 12:03PM by zippdementia.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, everyone! I quickly realized how difficult it is going to be to read the story in this format, especially if people also want to post comments and what not. So from now on I'm hosting and updating the story at Fan Fiction. The first chapter is up today and the second chapter should go up next week, which will bring us current with what's been posted here and go a little bit further. It should be regular updates after that, as I'm writing about 1000 words a day. I'm also going to go in sometime soon and also add an author's note, directing people to John Harper's game and explaining a bit of the history behind the fiction.<br/><br/>In any case, I hope you'll continue to read the posts; I will post on this thread when I've made an update and, special for this site, I'll give a little bit of the background behind each update and what was going on in the game and how that translated to the final narrative.<br/><br/>I always appreciate feedback if you have it, but regardless I just hope people realize how cool Ghost.Echoe is. Thanks to John Harper for inviting me and my players to explore a new world.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036607/1/Two-Sides-of-Midnight" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036607/1/Two-Sides-of-Midnight</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zippdementia" title="zippdementia"><img alt="zippdementia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zippdementia">zippdementia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407065/#Comment_407065" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-24T00:32:26+00:00" title="February 24, 2013 12:32AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2013 12:33AM by zippdementia.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chapter 2 is up on fan fiction! All of what is here is exactly what the players posted as their actions and sentiments. The only character I've made some changes to was .SORT. In the original game he was played by someone who liked to play devil's advocate, preferring to go independent and have long segments by himself. I've kept as much of that as makes sense, but I've tweaked the character to make him a little more sympathetic and to explain his actions more. He was really an extension of the player, so I've tried to make him more of an original character here. The artist's view of the planes gives him a nice reason to act a little disengaged from the situation. To him, the Planes are an experience. I've tried to add, rather than take away, traits from his character.<br/><br/>Regardless, the plot hasn't changed, nor has character actions. Just giving more details here. Not many more, you'd be surprised how much the players wrote for this game!<br/><br/>I always wondered if .GREP got the idea of the collapsible rifle from Hitman. He had talked about wearing a suit, too, which would fit in with Hitman. But then again, his avatar image for the game was the guy who played Jack in Lost, only in that godawful movie Vantage Point. Maybe he took it from the avatar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zippdementia" title="zippdementia"><img alt="zippdementia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zippdementia">zippdementia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408324/#Comment_408324" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-06T17:49:13+00:00" title="March  6, 2013  5:49PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, no update just yet. Just a note to say I am writing and, no, the story isn't dead. I've just been buried with freelance writing and design work. Have to pay the bills, you know? Also, Tomb Raider just came out.<br/><br/>Here's a couple sneak previews of what's coming in the next chapter:<br/><br/>"They were known as //RATS among the Covens. Unlike the Ghosts, which appeared to be bundles of energy, the //RATS seemed disturbingly fleshy. They were bizarre creatures, closely resembling the upper half of a human torso with unusually long arms. Their skin looked like a sick animal's might, if you shaved its entire body. It was a dirty grey color, splotchy with bruises and liver spots. The heads had no eyes, just a wide jaw rimmed with razor-sharp teeth. This appendage grew out of their shoulders like a long neck. The //RATS had no legs, their bottom halves trailed off in folds of loose skin and fat, and yet they moved incredibly fast along the walls and the ceiling of the tunnel, pulling themselves with their six-fingered claws.<br/><br/>\u201cClick Clack\u201d only describes the general idea of the sound they made, the way it might appear on the pages of a comic book. The click made .GREP\u2019s teeth hurt and the clack was like cockroaches running up and down his sides. It was the click of someone gently tapping a nail into a pretty girl\u2019s skull. It was the clack of his father\u2019s belt banging against the buttons of his jeans as he stalked down the hallway towards .GREP\u2019s room, his voice soft and whispering, telling .GREP of all the things he was about to do to him."<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>"Of course they'd all target one person. Focus fire, a good tactic if you have the angles. Or a suicidal desire to take someone down. Also makes it hard for allies to engage without risk of harming the victim. Over penetration, a miss, any number of little uncontrollable problems could spell disaster.<br/><br/>One thing .GREP had learned in his eventful life was that, in combat, pretty much the only thing you could control was yourself. Staying calm in the heat of battle was the best way to keep yourself, and your team, alive. He pulled the bolt back on his rifle, manually ejecting the old shell and clicking a new bullet into place. He took aim on one of the twitching //RATS and then screamed as the remains of the //RAT at his feet, wrapped around his leg and dug reformed fangs into the thick of his muscle."<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zippdementia" title="zippdementia"><img alt="zippdementia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zippdementia">zippdementia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408369/#Comment_408369" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-07T10:50:49+00:00" title="March  7, 2013 10:50AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay! As promised, Chapter 3 is out! This chapter was fun because I got to extract a lot of the "out of game" banter and relationships and fit them into the character personalities. When you're playing a play-by-post game, a lot of times you lose dialog strings\u2014it's just too hard for people to start and develop a conversation when it could be hours before someone logs in. So while description definitely is great on play-by-post, dialog is usually summarized. So in writing this in novel form, I've had to try and extrapolate what the dialog would be in certain sections and work it in as actual dialog, rather than the usual monologues and summaries you get.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036607/3/Two-Sides-of-Midnight" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036607/3/Two-Sides-of-Midnight</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zippdementia" title="zippdementia"><img alt="zippdementia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zippdementia">zippdementia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410238/#Comment_410238" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T12:41:35+00:00" title="March 23, 2013 12:41PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chapter 4 is out!

After finishing chapter five of \u201cTwo Sides of Midnight,\u201d I took a long break from the project in order to focus on finishing my last term and also to do some soul searching about where I wanted to go next. I liked what I had written, but I was feeling a little bored with the characters already, and I realized (after consideration) that it was because I hadn\u2019t given them enough of a history or anything to really do except freak out about their situation in the early chapters. I was happy with the way the team was working and had been established, but now I needed to explore deeper the individuals.<br/><br/>So that\u2019s chapter six. I\u2019m taking one of the characters and going into the past for a while. Then I\u2019ll jump back to the present and resolve the current situation. I had played around with doing this idea before and figure it is going to be a stylistic theme throughout the story, but I hadn\u2019t expected to do it so soon!<br/><br/>Things take a different turn in this new chapter, which is the beginning of a series of interludes that will fill in more information about one of the main characters and a little bit more about the world and our situation.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036607/6/Two-Sides-of-Midnight" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036607/6/Two-Sides-of-Midnight</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
