The groups that I play with have a similar gaming background: they have many years of RPG experience, but none of them knew indie RPGs existed until I brought up the topic at the gaming table.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I'm the pioneer of a group of about 15 (!) people who meet in various constellations to play traditional RPGs on a regular basis, and I'm trying to spark their interest in indie RPGs.<br/>\nI've been doing some reading in many forums and I've listened to numerous podcasts (including many of The Walking Eye's AP podcasts, which I found immensely helpful) over the past four months, and I managed to get a few of my fellow gamers interested in the things that I read and heard about. One of them was so excited when I told him about BW's character creation system that he ordered the Burning Wheel books from the US (we're all Germans, by the way). But he's just one of fifteen people; the majority remains skeptical.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo next week three of us will be meeting up for a few days, and I've somehow managed to reserve an entire day for some "experimental" role playing. They're curious to see what's so different about indie RPGs, and I'm hoping that I can somehow excite them. I'm just not sure how to pull it off.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the moment I see two possiblities:<br/>\n<br/>\n#1:<br/>\nI could GM Don't Rest Your Head and/or Mouseguard, since I own both books.<br/>\nHowever I have yet to read Mouseguard, so far I've only flipped through its lovely pages.<br/>\nI know that DRYH's game mechanics are simple. I've tried GMing it once with three players, but we were all terribly stuck in our traditional RPG mindset.<br/>\nIn the end I did most of the narrating; they created the opening scenes and I had them narrate the majority of what happened in game when their rolls were successful (although they mostly ended up describing the actions of their characters, and not the effect that they had on their environment).<br/>\nOther than that, I felt like I was running a completely improvised traditional RPG session, only with very different game mechanics. Obviously that's not how it's supposed to be done, we just kept falling back to how we're used to playing RPGs, and I'm afraid that this could easily happen again with the next group.<br/>\n<br/>\n#2:<br/>\nI could GM a D&amp;D game for them, but incorporate various mechanics from other games. Giving them the narration to describe what happens when their rolls are successful, using conflict resolution instead of task resolution (which, up to now, is the only way we're used to handling things), setting stakes, and perhaps even adding BW's Beliefs and Instincts mechanics for some flavor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that this session will be rather important, as it may very well make or break their interest in non-traditional RPGs. If I can excite these two players with whatever I do, it'll affect the rest of the players as well: if the three of us have a good time with our "experimental" RPG session, the others will be more willing to give it a shot as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy questions are:<br/>\nWhich of the two options makes more sense, running an indie RPG, or running a traditional RPG with indie RPG elements? What can I do to make sure that I don't "screw up" GMing DRYH (again)? Is Mouseguard a good game, considering the circumstances and my lack of experience with indie games?<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently I'm leaning towards the "D&amp;D with extra mechanics" idea. Since we could continue playing an ongoing campaign, the added story gaming elements would really stand out compared to the way we normally play D&amp;D. We'd be able to experiment without leaving our comfort zone. Other than the elements that I mentioned under #2, can you think of any other indie/story game mechanics that could easily be ported to D&amp;D?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMany thanks in advance! :o)<br/>\n<br/>\nDon<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: If there is an indie RPG out there that literally forces the GM and the players to think outside their traditional RPG boxes and doesn't allow them to revert to their "old ways", I would consider that as an option as well. I'm more than willing to invest in a new game or even two (must be available as a pdf!), provided that the rules are relatively easy/quick to grasp - we're meeting up on Monday and playing on Wednesday, so whatever I'm GMing, I'll need to have wrapped my head around it pretty soon.<br/>\nDoes anyone have a suggestion?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226128/#Comment_226128" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T05:58:50+00:00" title="August 20, 2009  5:58AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Play something simple that you can run well, that you know works, that you're familiar enough with that you can focus on gming the game in the style you want to encourage.<br/>\n<br/>\nNothing confirms a gamers conviction that those "other" games suck than a poorly run session.

If you are excited about a different style of play, communicate that excitement and look for people who are also excited, or at least interested in trying it out.  If nobody is interested in your circle of friends, look around for people who are or invite non-gamers to try stuff out.<br><br>Playing with people who are already well versed in the new style is hugely helpful and instructive.  If you get a chance, play with some folks who are already into the sort of games you are interested in.  Conventions and other gatherings are great for this.  If this isn't possible, grab your enthusiastic friends (see above) and experiment, keeping the stakes low and focusing on enjoying yourselves.  There are a few games that are really, really hard to mess up, and I'm sure folks would be glad to suggest some of these, too.<br><br>I would advise against trying to run something you aren't really comfortable with.  Mouse Guard is a very good game with very clear instructions, but if you have not even read it, don't try to run it next week.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226135/#Comment_226135" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T06:26:56+00:00" title="August 20, 2009  6:26AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2009 6:27AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: amoeba</cite>They're curious to see what's so different about indie RPGs, and I'm hoping that I can somehow excite them. I'm just not sure how to pull it off.</blockquote>\nI admit I skimmed your actual post -- enough to determine that, yes, you are the eight hundredth million person to start this exact thread -- but to be honest I think your answer is all there in your post title.<br/><br/>You are excited about these games -- and you are new to them! And they're novel and cool and exciting!<br/><br/>There's nothing more exciting than someone else who is engaged and excited by something. The worst thing you can do is set yourself up as some kind of <i>authority</i> with some kind of <i>special responsibility</i> -- and maybe it's too late and you already did that to some degree, but think about it. If you think these games are really cool and great and you're only just getting into them, there is no reason to conceal this situation from others. Be up front about it, engage them with the process in the same way you are engaged -- you're both at nearly the same point in this process.<br/><br/>Think of it as any other cool thing you've discovered and want to share with like-minded friends/peers. If I know a bunch of people who like music and I discover a new band that I think totally rocks and I'm like 'let's all go to the show and see them live!' everyone involved understands what is going on in terms of my level of responsibility for their fun. If it turns out the band sucks live or they don't like their music, then sure they might rib you about it but they're hardly going to put the blame on you. It's just a concert, it's not a big deal if not everyone thinks it's the best thing ever.<br/><br/>And similarly, to tie the metaphor back in to the advice other people are giving: if you're just getting into jazz, you don't invite your friends to go to see the crazy ultra-avante-garde band you've never heard of and that <i>you yourself</i> may not even appreciate. You take them to something closer to what got you excited in the first place -- because that way you know you can communicate your engagement &amp; appreciation, and explain what stuff you like about it. So play an indie game you really want to play and you really think is great -- don't try to push 'experimental' stuff that you yourself don't feel comfortable with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226136">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mordheim" title="mordheim"><img alt="mordheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.darkreign40k.com/drjoomla/images/comprofiler/tn62_47cea863027df.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mordheim">mordheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226136/#Comment_226136" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T06:31:10+00:00" title="August 20, 2009  6:31AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that the "concept" of either 3:16 or Zombie Cinema can be easily grasped by trad roleplayers.

Those elements should fit neatly onto the system while offering a new flavor of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226203/#Comment_226203" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T09:12:15+00:00" title="August 20, 2009  9:12AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Phil (and disagree with Graham): if you don't have a game you're comfortable running, take one or two techniques from games that excite you and let them inform your play of D&amp;D, at least until you have a new game you know you're ready to run. Beyond Phil's fine suggestions, I recommend adopting the policy that a player who rolls a success narrates the result of that success (and the GM says nothing, just listens). My friends' D&amp;D group has been doing this and finding it effective for drawing everyone into story creation.<br/><br/>Another idea, building on Daniel's suggestion, would be to play a "warmup" game, something less than a full session long, to test for interest and maybe develop technique. His "Happy Birthday, Robot!" would certainly qualify, as would "The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen" (and especially the smaller game "My Uncle the Baron," included in the new edition). "Puppetland" is one of my favorite games, and has a rule that requires a game to last precisely an hour. You can google "role-playing poems" to find some more examples. If none of these interest you, well, I've got a GM-less game in advanced beta right now that can be played in an hour or maybe a little more, which I could send you if you whisper me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226227/#Comment_226227" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T09:59:59+00:00" title="August 20, 2009  9:59AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unless your comfortable with a specific game they'd like to play I'd second adding in a few specific techniques.

Starblazer uses the same rules essentially but it's huge and builds on the system substantially.   <br/><br/>I find FATE a nice gateway in that there is more traditional stuff (skill, stunts aka 'feats', and even some ability to layout visual aides for a fight) combined with Aspects (story drivers and player empowerers) and Declarations (either with a FATE point or with a skill use).  Add in 'Let it Ride' and you have ability to teach some new concepts without freaking them out (if you think that might be an issue).  <br/><br/>Now if they're interested in exploring, you have a host of options.

I did, however, gain information via this thread that I otherwise wouldn't have gained! <br/>\n<br/>\nI think I need to reply to Jesse's question before I go on:<br/>\n<br/>\n@Jesse: Both "the more open shared creative experience they promote across the group", and "the more emotional character issue driven play" aspects excite me about non-traditional RPGs.<br/>\nA few years ago I GMed a campaign that was based on a city. Instead of creating the city on my own, I held three "city building" sessions with my players, where we all just brainstormed all sorts of ideas to flesh out the city. In the end we had several pages about things like the surrounding geography, the city's architecture, its shops, goods, specialties, its NPCs (important and unimportant alike), a city map, local legends, rumors, and even a calendar with holidays. Needless to say, this turned out to be the best darn city that's ever come to life in any game that I've GMed/played, and I've never seen my players this eager to walk the streets of a made-up city before. I quickly realized that tapping into the creative potential of my players turned the game into something far better than what I, alone, could have created. Having this type of collaboration happening in game (via shared narration), and not just during preparation, is half of what I'm looking for in Story Games.<br/>\nCreating and playing characters that drive the game with conflicting goals, differing philosophies, hidden agendas, and odd personality traits makes up the other half.<br/>\nI hope that helped answer your question?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's what I've gathered from this thread:<br/>\n<br/>\n- I should GM whatever system I feel most comfortable with. Since this applies to neither Mouseguard, nor DRYH, it leaves me with D&amp;D and additional mechanics (which some of you advised against) or an easy-to-grasp game.<br/>\n<br/>\n- I must say that I feel quite comfortable with adding different techniques to D&amp;D (or perhaps Castles &amp; Crusades). I'll try to incorporate the things that excited me about indie games in the first place, so I'm going with the following game mechanics/techniques:<br/>\nIntent resolution; setting stakes; "Let it Ride"; let the player who rolls a success narrate the result; BW's BITs. <br/>\nThese are all techniques that, in my opinion, won't collide with D&amp;D's game mechanics, so they're quite safe to try out.<br/>\nAs some of you have suggested, I'll also have a look at aspects from SotC SRD, and the FATE (or rather Awesome Adventures and Wheel of Fate) mechanics.<br/>\nI'll look up Sweet20 as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the games that all of you have suggested, I'll look into 3:16 (which was named rather often), Lady Blackbird, "Happy Birthday, Robot!", and Puppetland (since they both sound like good and short warm-up games). I'll see which of these I'd feel comfortable GMing!<br/>\n<br/>\n@Aik: There's a huge chance that I'm misinterpreting things, but while the DRYH rulebook is a bit sketchy about the collaborative story telling part, I do think that DRYH is supposed to contain more collaborative story telling than a traditional RPG. The players describe their characters' opening scenes, which, in my eyes, takes the reins out of the GM's hands right from the start. As a GM this is easier to deal with if you already know what their opening scenes will look like, since you'll have a few cues upon which you can prepare your game. But if you're doing the character creation right before you start the game (which I did), their character motivations and goals, their opening scenes and their narrations after successful rolls will direct the game, and quite possibly move it in a completely different direction than what you could have prepared for.<br/>\nI felt that my role as a GM was to know the world that they were moving in, and to bring it alive by reacting to their actions. This actually worked well at the beginning; they actively decided in which direction the story was going, and I was busy creating the stage for them to act on. But then it just suddenly flipped (I wish I had recorded the session to figure out when and why it happened), because at some point they began looking in my direction for things to react to, and that's where it started to feel like a traditional RPG.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for all the help, everyone - and thanks for your time.<br/>\nIt's much appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\nDon                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226736">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226736/#Comment_226736" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T10:28:35+00:00" title="August 22, 2009 10:28AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess this is a little late, but all I have to add is this:<br/><br/>Run/play whatever you are excited to play most.
