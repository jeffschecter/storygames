First, I look if the module has anything defined ("this lock has DC 20 to pick") and use it -- it usually does, either in the dungeon description or in the description of the monster involved. If it doesn't, or if we need to involve the dice in some unexpected action, I discuss some reasonable outcomes for DC:s 12 and 20 with the players before we roll; 12 is succeed with a cost but we decide the cost before the dice are thrown. And sub 12 is always some pretty gruesome fate. Or if it's really a case of you fail or you succeed, I use 15, that's my standard.<br/><br/>When I write my own dungeons, I use 15+4dF to generate a DC and note that down. The extra variance is so that I can use the Passive Perception rule better (i.e. someone with passive perception 16 can notice obvious things with DC 16 or lower). If the players are carefully looking around, they will find it, but this is an extra fallback. Sometimes the tripwire stretched across the corridor is just that obvious.<br/><br/>I agree that DM set DCs have their issues. But the dice and algorithms are my friend to not have to do that.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454198/#Comment_454198" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-25T17:56:04+00:00" title="June 25, 2016  5:56PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds like a solid method!

I've never seen it after playing for two years.<br/>A bell curve demands a <i>narrower</i> range of bonuses.<br/><br/>With this system, +3 which is pretty typical in D&amp;D, that's 40/40/20, the same +0 in AW (42/42/16).<br/>AW +1 is 28/44/28, close to D&amp;D +5 (30/40/30) which is also common enough after a couple of levels.<br/><br/>AW +2 is 16/42/42, close enough to D&amp;D +8 (20/40/40) which is very rare. I've yet to see that (I've seen +7 very rarely, that's the highest I've seen for an ability check with proficiency. Without proficiency or belt of giant strength, the highest humanly possible is +5.)<br/><br/><br/>AW +3 is 9/33/58, I don't think that's far enough away from D&amp;D's +10, which is 10/40/50, to justify bringing out 2d6 if I'm already playing D&amp;D (note that some versions of D&amp;D do do that, like Stars Without Numbers for example). I have never ever seen a +10. Remember that you yourself used it as an example? <b>AW +3 has only 9% (actually 8 and a third) chance of complete failure</b> compared to D&amp;D's 10%.  You need to roll a 2 or a 3, which is three different ways out of thirty-six, or 1/12. 1/12 is lower than 1/10. Bell curves can be a little unintuitive like that some times.<br/><br/>So, D&amp;D has <i>finer</i> granularity of bonuses than AW has.<br/>Please don't take this as a knock against AW.<br/><br/>I was playing D&amp;D, read Vincent's suggestions at the end of The Seclusium of Orphone of the Three Visions to add 2d6 in D&amp;D, did the math and found that since I was already playing D&amp;D, which the suggested "DM sets anything between 10 and 20, we suggest 10 easy, 15 medium, 20 hard", I thought 12/20 instead mapped <i>very</i> well. I read Rob Donoghue's sessions reports of Dungeon World and he observed that it's the 7-9 results that (for him) drove the action more than anything else. And while yes, 2d6 is a bell curve (actually an upside down straight V), interestingly enough the 7-9 stays very close to 40% through +0, +1 and +2 so I knew that I wanted a 40% chance of partial, and from then it was only a matter of selecting where to start and end that partial and I decided on 12 and 20 since it matched up with the stats I was expecting D&amp;D to be at through most of the adventurer's careers, and it has.<br/><br/>The DMG suggests a 25% chance of partial, it suggests 10 and 15 on page 242. Informed by Donoghue's blog, I thought I'd use DCs it to be a little more similar to DW/AW (still within the RAW, the 25% chance of partial is only in a little "for example" sentence). Remember, this started by tinkering with D&amp;D rather than tinkering with DW. Just informed by DW.<br/><br/>I see a lot of love for bell curves and I do use them myself for subsystems, they're very interesting for things like weighted encounter tables or when you want to have some results very rare and other results very common.<br/><br/><br/>TL;DR:<br/>- I read say Donoghue say AW seem to be designed on getting a proper amount of partials.<br/>- I find AW sweet spot gets 40% partials<br/>- I get 40% partials, am happy<br/>- since my curve is linear, I always get 40% partials even as characters get better.

Interesting! I won't paste the table of results here, but here are my conclusions:)<br/><br/>* Overall, the method works pretty well. The equivalent range (to AW) is -3 to +11 or so.<br/><br/>* It requires the "natural 1 always fails/natural 20 always succeeds" rule, which suits D&amp;D just fine.<br/><br/>* 0 to +1 is equivalent to +3 to +8. (I would probably move the DCs down, to perhaps 10 and 18, and use a version of D&amp;D which is less bonus-happy, but that's just a matter of taste. It just moves the entire scale over this way or that.)<br/><br/>In this range, the odds are very close. I think I prefer the AW odds a little (slightly more chance of a partial success throughout the range), but it's probably close enough not to be noticeable. <br/><br/>* Above +8, it's kind of a matter of taste. +9 is very similar to an AW +3, but I actually like the odds a little more in the d20 version (more failure and more partial success than with 2d6).<br/><br/>Above that, if you use the "natural 1" rule, you potentially have the advantages of more transparent math and the ability to keep piling on bonuses if what's in question is whether you have a partial success or a full success. That's potentially useful for game design!<br/><br/>For example, +13 is equivalent to +4. (And VERY close.)<br/><br/>* Under the "0" range (AW), we get +0 or +1 (d20) equivalent to -1 (AW). d20+1 has, in my opinion, better odds than AW-1 (more full success and partial successes). <br/><br/>Below that, though - even at +0 - we fall to a 5% chance of full success and stay there. This means that, for example, rolling at +1 is *dramatically* better than rolling at 0 (double your chances of a full success). Not sure I like that, but I suppose it's manageable.<br/><br/>If we keep going lower, we eventually line up pretty well with d20-3 = AW-2. (And here the odds are in favour of the d20 method, again, in my opinion, though very close.)<br/><br/>Interesting!<br/><br/>Now I have to pull out my chart for 2d20 and see how that compares...<br/><br/><br/>(On an unrelated sidenote, my feeling is that an adventure/dungeon crawl-type game actually *shouldn't* have so many "partial success" results. They're great for character drama or cinematic action, but potentially problematic for "ability checks" and similar things in an adventure. My hunch is that I'd want more plain failures and more plain successes in general, with common partial successes only for characters who are trying to do things that are quite borderline. I had a d6 pool method for this at some point, I could try to dig it up, but in any case it won't convert well to or from D&amp;D, so it might not be welcome in this thread.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454217/#Comment_454217" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-25T23:49:01+00:00" title="June 25, 2016 11:49PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, ran the numbers on the 2d20 method. That has similar odds for failure and full success to the AW roll, but even *higher* odds of a partial success through most of the range. Otherwise, the logic from the above applies.<br/><br/>My tentative conclusion is that they're all - all three methods - close enough to each other for cricket; it's mainly a question of whether you prefer adding numbers (d20+adds, 2d6+adds) or comparing numbers (2d20 vs. stat). Interesting, anyway!

And that's a normal AC roll anyway. Other disadvantageous situations are handled by a wonky 2d20 drop the highest mechanism (it skews the math <em>significantly</em> compared to AW). Since our 12/20 skill rolls are so rare, so far they've just been plain.<br/><br/>I watch a lot of RPG play on YouTube and other GMs and DMs ask for rolls constantly, compared to me when we're out of combat.

Where I have an issue is at the extremes. It means that really high-skill individuals basically can't fail (e.g. someone rolling at +10 can only fail on a 1 or a 2, and that's not even that extreme in a D&amp;D context), and that low-skill individuals can't ever achieve "full success" (someone with no bonuses trying to roll that 20 is damn rare).<br/><br/>A bell curve handles this much more nicely, and allows you to use a larger range of bonuses/penalties while retaining reasonable odds of all three outcomes in any given roll.</blockquote>\nI don't remember the exact maths, but when I wanted to implement AW-similar outcomes in a D&amp;D-like, I remember being resonably satisfied with roll under stat for success, roll under half stat for complete success.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
