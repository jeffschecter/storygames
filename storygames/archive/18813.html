A GM-driven game in line with The Griffen Principle would have some sort of support for reacting positively to the player who tries to light their magic oilslick on fire.<br/><br/>A different example would have a mechanical power where a bonus of "1" is gained if a particular user is on fire (let's say that they're also immune to fire's harmful effects). Can they jump in the way of someone else's fire spell being cast, adding themselves to the original target in order to enjoy the bonus of "1" later in the round? Could they instead have ended their previous turn rolling into the crackling fireplace to rest for a split second? Can they cast one of their fire spells on themselves? All yes; especially if these are player-generated ideas and not ideas fed by the game material or facilitator.<br/><br/>A third example shows that mechanics bounce off of one another even if completely divorced from the fiction. Let's say we're playing a fantasy deck-building rpg in which your character powers that are available to you each turn are jurisdicted by what cards you've drawn. Your character has a power that lets them draw a card whenever they take a point of damage. Sweet! Then you draw a card that says, when you draw this card, take two points of damage (and then there's some other effect too, when you play it) do you get to draw more cards now that you've taken the damage? Heck yeah! Griffen Principle. <br/><br/>Give me some more, weirder examples of this if you've got them. They don't have to be for games that exist yet. <br/>Also "no your rong"s always welcome.<br/>Thank you!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421554/#Comment_421554" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-16T11:44:15+00:00" title="September 16, 2013 11:44AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Magic the Gathering is really good for this.  I used to play a black/white deck with multiple different ways to take advantage of this kind of synergy (Lord of the Pit with Circle of Protection: Black, and I ignore the upkeep damage; Deathlace to turn creatures or spells black, with COP: Black; White Knights with protection from black, along with Deathlace to turn creatures or spells black;  Pestilence with White Knights and COP: Black; Nether Shadows with Lord of the Pit, if the Shadows are all in the graveyard then they cycle through: one comes out, next upkeep gets eaten by the LotP, and another one cycles out).  <br/><br/>Pretty much every version of D&amp;D has this in some respects, with special abilities, spells, magic items, and so on combining similarly.  HERO System is good for this also; you can build your characters with all kinds of things that only work in fire or sunlight or vs. dark magic or whatever, but this might not count.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421557/#Comment_421557" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-16T12:03:24+00:00" title="September 16, 2013 12:03PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paying attention to this; it may provide some answers to my own thread...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semiomant" title="semiomant"><img alt="semiomant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semiomant">semiomant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421589/#Comment_421589" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-17T03:39:37+00:00" title="September 17, 2013  3:39AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2013 3:40AM by semiomant.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But we are talking about setting up descriptors in advance, which then are combined creatively, even if the current synergy was not anticipated?<br/><br/>Or should it be also be possible to "retcon" in an advantageous synergy?

For example, what would happen if you shot a lightning bolt into the center of a lightning elemental? In Magic, because there are no rules that cover the element of spells, it has exactly the same effect as it would against a goblin, or if the spell had been an ice spell. <br/><br/>To be fair, many of the interactions that happen are due to the creators of Magic making an effort to support a modicum of narrative and 'fluff', and are more than aware of the tropes of fantasy. However, there are many interactions there which work mechanically even if you have to jump through mental hoops to justify it within a common-sense narrative, and many things that "should" work if this was a story, rather than a game with strict rules. (Why are elementals susceptible to Fear and Terror, while a golem is not. Or for that matter, why are brigands, cut throats, rat-men and all manner of gutter scum completely fearless, simply because they're summoned by Black mana?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421642/#Comment_421642" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-18T08:53:03+00:00" title="September 18, 2013  8:53AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the spirit of this principle!

The fun here can lie in:<br/>- discovering these interactions, especially when they were not intended by the creators (unlimited Splinter Twin copies etc.)<br/>- setting up your resources to pull off the interaction reliably/at the right time/by surprise/etc.<br/>The disadvantage is that the interactions are limited and predetermined.<br/><br/>Fiction-based games can provide non-specific, emergent interactions based on interpretations of the fiction:<br/>- reincorporation of something another player contributed earlier<br/>- interaction based on a new interpretation<br/>- using the agreed-upon frame of reference ("realistic physics", "ritualistic magic with x principles") to make new connections<br/>The disadvantage is that the interactions are unreliable, subject to "approval" (moment of judgment), and can feel boring if all they give you is a static bonus.<br/><br/>One great thing about RPGs is that they can combine both of these. One such approach is DnD 4e's Page 42. It translates fictional interactions into a mechanical framework. But the framework is itself pretty static.<br/><br/>Another approach is Anima Prime's effect goals. These provide a variety of mechanical effects, but which ones apply are based on the fictional interactions.<br/><br/>I think there's still a lot of room for innovation and game design in this combined space. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
