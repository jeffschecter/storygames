Does resolution of uncertain actions work in a consistent manner?<br/><br/>Failure state: playing the GM: All resolution is based purely on the GM's whims.<br/><br/>2) Adventure design. Is the opposition in this dungeon/hex-crawl/urban fantasy environment at least somewhat plausible as something to be handled by the PCs?<br/><br/>Failure state: Tomb of Horrors (or at least, "Tomb of Horrors by reputation"). <br/><br/>3) NPC / environmental reactivity. Does the world respond to the PCs in a logical and limited manner?<br/><br/>Failure state: Enemy wizard who spies on you all the time, undetectably, and is thus able to foil all of your plans--or any similar situation where the NPCs seem to be omniscient.<br/><br/>Of course, these failure states often come in combination, but to my mind it's worth separating them out. Sometimes, deliberately engaging with badness in one of the three arenas can be fun, believe it or not: Back in college, we played Castle Greyhawk*, an utterly absurd parody adventure that's also really crappily designed, at least on certain levels of the dungeon (failure state #2; the design wasn't uniform because each level was written by a different author). However, the GM (Ben Lehman, as it happens) was very transparent with us about how terrible the design was, and was rigorous about following the rules and not having the NPCs be overly clever. A good time was had by all.<br/><br/>Failure state <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, alone, can still produce a functional game if the dungeon is fun and engaging and if the GM's whims aren't too harsh (and don't include NPC omniscience, obviously).<br/><br/>Failure state <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, alone, can still produce a functional game if the players are bought into the idea of a Big Brother type state that is, in fact, constantly watching them. Something like Paranoia, maybe.<br/><br/>What I see happening in these conversations, sometimes, is that some OSR proponents only address one or maybe two of the failure states, but not all three. I'm here to say, I really think they're all valid concerns; even if it's possible to have a functional game otherwise, it's perfectly normal to want all of them addressed--it's certainly what I strive for when GMing, especially anything in the vein of a dungeon-crawl or the like.<br/><br/>So, are there other failure states? Am I wrong to separate them out like this? What have your experiences been?<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*Fun fact: my first character in that game was a samurai pizza delivery boy, and is the reason I use "Deliverator" as my screen name in all online forums.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458466/#Comment_458466" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-01T15:15:13+00:00" title="December  1, 2016  3:15PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2016 3:19PM by komradebob.">edited December 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WRT to failure state 1: Is it ever really based on entirely GM whims?<br/><br/>I would assume that even in a situation where the GM has gone almost entirely over to a simplistic approach along the lines of " Tell me what you want the character to do, I'll tell you what results you need to roll on die type X" that there is some sort of reasoning beyond whim going on with the GM.<br/><br/>( Mind you, having been that sort of GM on occasion, I have certainly fallen into some traps with that method.

I suppose those are all issues that can become problematic, assuming that no methodology is present to address them.<br/><br/>Thinking about it a bit more, perhaps my favourite issue of trust might count for your list as well: the referee-type GMing role used in these games presumes that the play group is capable of building up the GM as a neutral arbiter; failure to do so ultimately ends with players disengaging from the game due to the GM's loss of legitimacy.

I find the categories themselves a bit odd at first reading (and there's a lot of overlap, for example, between <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and #3).<br/><br/>My sense here is that, like Eero says above, the true "failure states" have to do with the social environment and the participants' expectations of each other. For instance, if I'm expecting the GM or the module to provide somewhat "balanced" opposition for me to test my luck against, but the GM fudges the dice so that I always succeed, we will sooner or later meet something like the failure states you've described. (I'm not sure why they are all "negative", in terms of character death or failure - surely other possibilities exist?)<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, my hunch is that all these "failure states" are caused by a deeper, underlying issue in the realm of social expectations and player-player interaction. (Note, for an example, how Ben's transparency with regards to Castle Greyhawk allowed your group to avoid failure state <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> despite - presumably - an implausible or "failed" adventure design.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458496/#Comment_458496" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-02T05:27:55+00:00" title="December  2, 2016  5:27AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The reason <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> are intended to be distinct is that <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is purely about resolution mechanics, whereas <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> is about the integrity of the fiction.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> is about, say, how we figure out if a character can grab onto the edge of a cliff they've been pushed off of. (And in fact, how we determine that the monster pushed them in the first place!)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> is about how much the PCs purely in-fiction planning ends up mattering, or how much information the NPCs have about the PCs' capabilities and resources.<br/><br/>Of course all RPG failure states or critical issues are ultimately about communication; that's well established around here, which is why I wanted to move this here from RPG.net in the first place. I simply think these three issues *are* distinct, and yet often in discussions about potentially problematic OSR play, conflated.<br/><br/>And I do agree that "failure" can mean "Monty Haul campaign with no tension" as much as "TPK." Either is unfun, generally speaking.<br/><br/>Komradebob \u2014 the problem with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, as someone over on the RPG.net thread put it, is that most people have no real understanding of probability, especially iterative probability, which your allusion to Let It Ride also hints at.<br/><br/>Note that I don't really care what the base probability of any *given* action is. But once it has been established, then the probabilities of other things need to make sense around it. Let's say a wizard is trying to sneak down a corridor, and the GM calls for the player to roll under their Dex, call it a 12. That's a 60% chance of success. Then we look at the Thief's character sheet, and see they have a 35% chance to Move Silently. And then we all sigh loudly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458499/#Comment_458499" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-02T14:53:24+00:00" title="December  2, 2016  2:53PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh, your Thief vs MU sneaking example is an old and classic one.

Similarly, there's a big appetite for playing nonsensical funhouse type adventures like White Plume Mountain (not tomb of horrors...yet), maybe not as our main game, but as a diversion that is in dialogue with the game history, and as an absurd kind of fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458511/#Comment_458511" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-02T23:05:47+00:00" title="December  2, 2016 11:05PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>i identify the \u201crulings not rules\u201d mantra as a place where the osr discourse goes off the rails, or at least becomes counter to its own agendas tbh.<br/></blockquote>\nI think this is pretty interesting, because "rulings, not rules" can be interpreted in a few different ways.<br/><br/>Ways I've seen people interpret "rulings, not rules":<br/><br/>1. The GM is always right. She runs the game and is responsible for making it awesome. This is her power, to go with that responsibility. (This is, essentially, "Rule Zero".)<br/><br/>2. Rules are good, but limited: sometimes they won't quite do the right thing for what we're aiming at in the game. Therefore, we have the ability to adjust a rule on the fly to make it fit this particular situation. ("Normally, you'd need to use <i>Move Silently</i> to get past an obstacle like this, but since the Thief isn't here, why don't you all make Dex checks, instead?") <br/><br/>This is a temporary overruling of existing rules, made with the goal of better matching the expected reality (in the example above, it's about not denying the players a chance to get past the obstacle).<br/><br/>People who view rules as "simulating" an objective reality can sometimes lean strongly on this one.<br/><br/>3. We do not have rules in place to cover all necessary situations. Instead, we let the game evolve as we play: when a situation comes up, we make a ruling to reflect how we want to deal with it. <br/><br/>However, the rules form the backbone of our gaming: they become a set of precedents or "common law" we can refer to as we move forward.<br/><br/>Under this view, the example from <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> would be anathema.<br/><br/>There are probably others, I'd imagine. (Name some you've seen!)<br/><br/>Personally, I've had the most fun and success with "rulings, not rules" when seen in the third form. (And it's possible that the earliest games of D&amp;D operated exactly like this.) <br/><br/>The game presents itself as adventure challenge for the players, and the rules can be made up or changed to serve the game as it suits us (maybe we'd like to put a strong focus on retainer morale, but the Friday night group is happy to gloss over it with a Charisma check), forming, over time, the "rails" for this form of play. However, the spirit of the game is that we all know the rule considerations when making decisions (e.g. the GM does not change a rule on the fly without explaining the consequences to the players first), and we stick to the "rulings" as much as possible, since they form our shared expectations.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458525/#Comment_458525" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-03T15:17:31+00:00" title="December  3, 2016  3:17PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some of these issues seem to stem from the very nature of game-y RPGs. And OSR games, so close to their wargame roots, are pretty damn game-y almost no matter what.<br/><br/>The big thing about having that neutral(ish) ref there is the ability by players to ask "Can I try...", with them then describing an action or plan that almost inevitably involves going outside of the expected use of existing rules.<br/><br/>Which is pretty awesome, and goes a bit beyond what a neutral(ish) ref does in a wargame, especially a PvP wargame (which is the normal set up).*<br/><br/>When that happens, I guess the GM could say " Nope. Ain't covered by the rules. Ain't gonna happen" But then you're just back  to playing a bog standard wargame.<br/><br/>OTOH, if the GM gives even a crappy chance of whatever cockeyed plans the players have come up with, even like a 10% chance of the thing working, then, as players, you're still better off than with the straight wargame-no rules/not possible approach.<br/><br/>This, off course, sets precedent, especially if it succeeds. If there is anyone,  who, given an inch will take a mile, it's players in an RPG in game-y mode. Since RPGs, far more than wargames, tend to be played in recurring, related, campaign style, this stuff can spiral out of hand very quickly, and encourages "arms race" approaches as much as anything else. In OSR/D&amp;D, it may be even more true than in other games, simply because of the Zero-to-Hero aspect also being involved.<br/><br/>_______________________________________________<br/>* Refs can be incredibly useful in miniatures wargames played without grids, even very simple and straight forward wargames ( much less ones written by Games Workshop which have a reputation for historically having many unconsidered rules interactions!).<br/><br/>Much of it simply involves being handy to make quick rulings on edge case situations, such as Line of Sight/ Line of Fire issues or movement/terrain interactions which are simply fuzzier due to the nature of the medium. Those edge case situations can have big impact on play, and it's often extremely hard for two opposing players in competitive, game-y mode to settle differences of opinion amicably and quickly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
