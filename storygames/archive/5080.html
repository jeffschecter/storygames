Jason has kindly volunteered to hawk a few ashcan/bootleg Uml\xe4ut games at Dreamation.  Which is utterly awesome of him.  But the poor guy's too tied up with other things to run the game at the con.  So I'm looking for another awesome hero to run a slot (or two, if you like!) of Uml\xe4ut for me.<br/><br/>Obviously you'd have my undying gratitude and an exclusive copy of the best GMless Heavy Metal RPG ever published in Hampshire.  Plus, obviously I'll return the favour if you have a game you'd like run here in the UK.  I'm at Conception at the end of January, so I could easily do that then.<br/><br/>Help me, Story Games posters, you're my only hope!<br/><br/>(More information about Uml\xe4ut: Game of Metal can be found here: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4078" rel="nofollow">clicky</a>)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
