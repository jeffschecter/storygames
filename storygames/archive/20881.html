He discusses the techniques of railroading, variations, and how they might be unrightfully maligned. (Very reminiscent of conversations we had not too ago here on Story Games - his position seems similar to <a href="/forums/profile/AsIf%27s">@AsIf's</a> in those earlier threads. He will have to chime to say if that's true or not, of course!)<br/><br/><a href="https://medium.com/gameplaywright-presents/the-illusionists-lament-dramaturgy-and-illusion-for-the-best-in-rpg-play-97d348bcb16#.eldvr51vo" rel="nofollow">The Illusionist's Lament</a><br/><br/><a href="https://medium.com/gameplaywright-presents/sword-fighting-on-a-roller-coaster-railroading-for-the-best-in-rpg-play-547333c80359#.mg5vx7vml" rel="nofollow">Railroading for the Best in RPG Play</a><br/><br/>It probably won't come as a huge surprise to anyone who read my posts in those earlier discussions that I disagree quite strongly with the general rhetoric here. In any case, though, the articles are thought-provoking and an interesting read. I like Hindmarch's take on "immersion" very much, for instance.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458349/#Comment_458349" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-25T21:01:16+00:00" title="November 25, 2016  9:01PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>If you comment here, please keep it civil - these discussions have a history of getting heated. We're all friends here, right?<br/></i><br/>Here's my take:<br/><br/>Why do I disagree with Hindmarch? <br/><br/>Point 1: All such discussions are so rife with metaphor and miscommunication that I think they must be paired with examples of play. It's easy to pontificate about the nature of deception, but, you know, what techniques does that actually translate to at the table? What's the practical angle here; how do you actually play?<br/><br/>Point 2: I think most discussions of "railroading" and similar concepts (perhaps even ALL of them!) are easily resolved by realizing two things, and I find articles like these ignore both:<br/><br/>a) Having some kind of conception of the social reality of roleplaying (as opposed to looking at whether a wall makes it impossible for Ben's character to reach the fountain - that, sure, could be used in a million different ways, good and bad).<br/><br/>Instead: what's happening between the people at the table? Also, have the right expectations been communicated, and are they continuing to be communicated, when unclear?<br/><br/>b) Having some kind of conception of Creative Agenda, or a game's object, or its unspoken promises (whatever you want to call this, if you're allergic to the term "Creative Agenda"). This cuts through "ambiguous" cases almost instantly. <br/><br/>Instead: are these decisions being made right relevant to the goals of our game? Are the right people getting to make them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458357/#Comment_458357" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-27T04:06:16+00:00" title="November 27, 2016  4:06AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;The unfair practice associated with illusionism isn\u2019t deception\u200a\u2014\u200athat can be a legit part of narrative\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s dishonesty... Dishonesty is about misrepresenting the choices that matter, and it includes the GM lying to herself about her own willingness to incorporate the players\u2019 inputs into the unfolding fiction.&lt;&lt;<br/><br/>This I agree with strongly. It's why in combat-heavy games I find GM fudging to keep PCs alive so frustrating. If combat is the only thing (or nearly so) of consequence, then why would you render null failure in that arena? Of course, there is a lot more to say here, about setting stakes beyond death, setting genre expectations properly, etc., but fundamentally it comes down to that: if death is on the line, then it needs to *actually* be on the line.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;If we trust the GM\u200a\u2014\u200aand if we ask the GM to be the player who invests time and money in books, maps, and prep\u2014 and then vilify the responsibility we give her, we players become complicit adversaries.&lt;&lt;<br/><br/>This I definitely agree with. I can't tell you how many con or one-shot games I've been involved with where the GM had a clearly prepped premise, maybe railroady or maybe more of a sandbox-y dungeon-y, thing, but clearly one thing. But some asshole player in the game insisted on dicking around in town or asking the module hook NPC endless questions. The game could have been perfectly fine if we'd just skipped the preliminaries (and of course a more skilled or confident GM could have stopped the disruptive behavior in various ways), but the player was acting like even agreeing to go along with the basic premise of the adventure would be acceding to railroading, so they had to perform this elaborate kabuki of deeply angsting about what their character would do.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the immersion stuff is also great.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;If not, falling back on narrative tricks\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding illusionism\u200a\u2014\u200ato make the most of the moment is preferable sometimes to a joyless exercise in RPG theory.&lt;&lt;<br/><br/>I have no idea what he's talking about here. That is, I can parse the meaning, but I can't think of an actual example of what this looks like.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; I keep the tools of illusionism in my kit because I play with a wide variety of players in a wide variety of game styles. It hasn\u2019t been my experience that everyone wants equal authorship all the time or that everyone will come around to a single style of play if only they saw things my way. &lt;&lt;<br/><br/>This is pure conflation / false dichotomy. You can have a game with a strong central GM, who has authority over most aspects of the game world outside of the PCs, who nevertheless doesn't use illusionism.<br/><br/>In the end, this a very poetic, beautifully-written article, but I'm not sure it contains any actionable take-aways. I also have no idea what Hindmarch means by Illusionism, and I don't just mean this in the usual "illusionism versus participationism" jargon wars way, either. <br/><br/>The most egregious example is this:<br/>&gt;&gt;...falling back on narrative tricks\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding illusionism\u200a\u2014\u200ato make the most of the moment is preferable sometimes to a joyless exercise in RPG theory.&lt;&lt;<br/><br/>What... what does this mean?

There may be reason for illusionism, but my experience does not support the notion that you'd want it to save time, get along with strangers and to increase reliability of the game. It hasn't done any of those three things for me.<br/><br/>I mean, it's just about the simplest thing in the world to just tell the other players what you want them to do, and how you want them to participate. It seems to be straight up cultural bias (or brain damage, as one might wish to term it) that makes this difficult for roleplayers. I would be the first to admit that it's not in the traditional tool-set, but anybody struggling with these things should at least <i>try</i> it: the next time you have a player acting in a counter-productive fashion, instead of trying to mislead them into sticking to your plot (or whatever it is that you'd use illusionism for), try asking them why they're acting that way, and tell them what kind of action you're expecting of them. Sure, it breaks the precious illusion of freedom (forcing you to admit that you were promising things you couldn't deliver - painful, but honest), but in exchange you get actually cooperative players. I would not be surprised if this was a positive trade-off for at least some illusionists.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458360/#Comment_458360" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-27T13:18:23+00:00" title="November 27, 2016  1:18PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, yeah, that reminds me of the other thing I wanted to talk about here. Something that never really comes up in these discussions, but probably should, especially in the case of explicit comparisons to illusionist stagecraft: the personal charisma of the GM.<br/><br/>I've known GMs who simply had a raw force of magnetism that's actually quite incredible. Not all these GMs engage in dishonesty, either, but the point is that they can easily get away with it if they want to. Their players are simply much more willing to, as Will puts it, suspend disbelief, than players of other GMs. So those GMs simply don't *need* as much in the way of careful communication practices, accurate applications of mechanics, flag-based plotting, or any of a host of other techniques developed in the Forge and post-Forge eras.<br/><br/>Think of it like Sorcerers vs. Wizards in D&amp;D, or musicians who play by ear versus those who learn from sheet music.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458362/#Comment_458362" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-27T16:24:25+00:00" title="November 27, 2016  4:24PM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt,<br/><br/>While I certainly believe that you have seen this (and I've met a few, as well), I'd be wary of writing about it as if it were a virtue - and many might draw that conclusion from your post.

It's easy to pontificate about the nature of deception, but, you know, what techniques does that actually translate to at the table? What's the practical angle here; how do you actually play?<br/></blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458386/#Comment_458386" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-28T05:35:36+00:00" title="November 28, 2016  5:35AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, Dave, and Paul aggressively agree with each other; news at 11! :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458389/#Comment_458389" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-28T06:38:17+00:00" title="November 28, 2016  6:38AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The media is terribly biased these days, I've heard...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458410/#Comment_458410" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-29T05:15:51+00:00" title="November 29, 2016  5:15AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Erick Wujcik had the kind of charisma Deliverator's talking about. I have heard stories, from him and his players, about things that I would never try to pull and would never expect to enjoy having pulled on me that he was able to do and get away with. Now, "get away with" is a misnomer, I think, as he wasn't, in the stories I heard, being dishonest, just -- doing things that I don't expect I'd like it -- except that I remember talking to Erick, and my rule, after the first time, was "Make sure to use the bathroom before starting a conversation with him" because once he started talking, I'd find myself standing there an hour or so because it was a fascinating conversation. Non-gaming, in the dealers' hall, but... yeah, I'm not sure I wouldn't be enjoying what he did in a game, at least while I was playing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458411/#Comment_458411" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-11-29T06:04:38+00:00" title="November 29, 2016  6:04AM">November 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great example, Lisa. Thanks for sharing that.
