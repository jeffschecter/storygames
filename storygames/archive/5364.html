Since there's interest in it, I'm sharing it; I'll be happy if anyone else playtests it, just know that it's not been tested or edited on my end.  An alpha may still have a lot of assumptions built in, things I'm not spelling out because I'm going to be the one running it, and so on.<br/><br/>But what is Anima Prime? It's an action game based on anime and Final Fantasy X.  It's a driftable, semi-traditional game, sort of like FATE games.  It's also got a bunch of kewl powerz and cliches, and that's because I wanted that shit in there, by God <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I've got more to say, but it's Aidan's birthday, so that'll have to be later.

That's because it's fundamentally a group game (in contrast to Beast Hunters).  Let me introduce you to the basics first--this will sound somewhat familiar to those of you who've played or run Beast Hunters.<br/><br/>There are four basic actions you can do on your turn in a conflict: maneuver, strike, achievement, action power.<br/><br/>For a maneuver, you describe your character's action.  This can be positioning, attacking, taunting, mooning the opposition, whatever.  The GM awards between 1 and 4 dice for that action.  You add 1 to 3 from your action pool (which starts at 10).  Other players can give you 1 die as well from theirs if they really liked what you did.  You now roll the dice and move all of those that show 3, 4 or 5 into your strike pool and all the 6s into your charge pool.  1s and 2s are discarded.<br/><br/>This structure does several things: It ensures that you don't fall into "I hit him" mode because of the GM dice.  Those also allow those who want to step up every round to do so, while also letting players who are not as fired up get by  without dragging the group down much (this is contrary to BH, where you need to step up every time and suffer greatly if you don't).  At the same time, the GM dice can be used to support stepping on up, but also good genre emulation or character revelations etc.<br/><br/>The ability to put in your own action dice lets you make some tactical choices about short-term versus long-term goals.  The die from other players allows immediate gift die/fanmail expressions.<br/><br/>Once you've got a few strike and charge dice, you can try to do damage (roll strike dice versus defense), achieve a goal (roll strike dice versus difficulty), or use a power.  You can also use powers with strikes (and some with maneuvers or achievements) to boost your damage.  Other powers grant positive (shield, quicken, empower) or negative (poisoned, blinded, etc.) conditions.  Powers use charge dice, which means that your big powers will only come out after a couple of maneuvers, which means built-in pacing.<br/><br/>To give players more choices, their characters also have traits and a passion.  Traits allow rerolls if you've played to the trait in an earlier character scene (this allows positioning and facilitates "shelving," as Johnstone calls it, or introducing elements to bring out later on in the story as making a difference).  Passions are like Final Fantasy X's overdrive sources--you gain extra charge dice when you get hurt, or when your friends get hurt, or when you defeat an enemy, etc.  Formulating them as passions allows them to further define your character.  Seeing "Anger" or "Bloodlust" as a character's passion gives me a different signal for them than "Compassion" or "Self-Loathing."<br/><br/>That's the core of it--hopefully easy to grasp after a little bit, with much less of a risk/payoff/disappointment divide as BH to facilitate more casual playing.<br/><br/>FFX also slipped in at a couple of different places other than the overdrive passion, such as making your own weapons with effect slots.<br/><br/>Oh, and did I mention you can summon eidolons (aka aeons)?  Creation rules for those are also included.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120789/#Comment_120789" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-20T15:45:03+00:00" title="January 20, 2008  3:45PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet.

There are no different domains.  You accumulate dice in general and not against particular threats.  There are only three wound circles.  And so on.  Overall, that makes it much more streamlined (at the loss of detail and certain strategical choices).  There's also no budget and no limit for the GM.  Those were all Gamist elements that this less intense game doesn't need.<br/><br/>I'd be happy if you get to give it a try!  Let me know how that pans out. It's still at a very early stage, and I mainly shared this because Andy asked about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots" title="dyjoots"><img alt="dyjoots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots">dyjoots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121128/#Comment_121128" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T21:18:12+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  9:18PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christian,<br/><br/>I'm very impressed with this, and I'd be very interested in seeing it developed further.

You can set Goals and Switches for social or mental interactions and use all the other rules as-is; you can even combine them with a fight, so that you have people debating and exchanging barbs as their swords clash in mid-air.  The idea of a character stunning someone with unparalleled logic and then following it up with a flaming blow to the face is too sweet to not happen.  The only things you really lose for non-combat conflicts are the powers, since they're not really applicable to most situations (unless you let things like Achievement Boost and Leadership carry over; I suppose that's at the group's discretion).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121425/#Comment_121425" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-23T06:33:59+00:00" title="January 23, 2008  6:33AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a section called "Other Conflicts" that talks about exactly this. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>And yes, using social or other actions in combat is absolutely allowed: "You can also taunt your opponent, embarrass them, rally your own troops, trigger a trap, or whatever else you come up with that would work to bring you into a better or your opponent into a worse situation than before, physically, mentally, or socially--or that brings you closer to achieving a goal."  I'll give social goal examples in later drafts, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
