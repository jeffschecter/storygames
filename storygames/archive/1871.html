                    Hi folks.  I've got a friend who wants to start a new game.   There're three options he's talking about: Spirit of the Century, Dying Earth, and Feng Shui.  The last two I'm pretty much unfamiliar with -- I was wondering if anyone might point out pitfalls or possible issues that come up with either of those game systems that might be avoided with a little foresight and/or some indie-kung-fu.<br/><br/>Not looking to trash talk either of the games -- they look and sound pretty cool -- just hoping for a few tips.                </div>

                            Never Played Dying Earth.  As for Feng Shui, IIRC you don't particularly get bonuses if you do stuff "awesomely", but if you don't the game can be a real drag. Just go nuts.  Also, look online for the Feng Chui fight location page.  It's pretty cool, and gives you tons of ideas for fight locations, and scenery that can be used to nail dudes with.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            There are a couple of generally positive Forge AP threads about Dying Earth; the rules look fun, but it's probably used to best effect if the players are Vance fans.  I think Ron or Clinton or somebody talked about junking the game's magic system for something entirely contrived and hand-waved, which is how Vance clearly handled the stuff in his stories.                        </div>

                            Dying Earth has some crazy-awesome stuff going for it, in a very much "roll a die, and blow the way the winds of fate do" sort of way.  I never got a chance to play it, but I have a strong sense that I could get hip-deep in some fun with it -- very much in a "romp about and kick the world into chaos" sort of way.<br/><br/>Feng Shui -- well, hell, man.  I'm a big fan of the Shadowfist card game, so that one hooked me right out the gate.  It has an excellent focus on action, and you can go really crazy with it in short order.  The oneshot I first played in involved my playing a deluded hockey player who got kicked out of the league for being too violent (think about it).  When the zombies attacked, his delusion kept insisting they were wearing the other team's jerseys.  A friend of mine ran a campaign where the timestream got hacked and the Aztec Empire never fell.  Back in the modern day conjunction there's no Mexico; just Aztec.  At which point I piped up "That means there's no Tex-Mex!  I guess you have Az-Tex instead!"  Feng Shui gives birth to much bizarrage... <br/><br/>...though of your list, it's probably the closest to the "traditional" end of things.  Each game does something outside of the "norm", though, and I am certain you'd have fun in any of the three.<br/><br/>[ob-shill]But you should go with Spirit of the Century. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>[/ob-shill]                        </div>

                            Tips on Feng Shui:<br/><br/>Do not use a map. Do not keep track of exactly how many mooks there are. There should be exactly enough mooks to give everyone a shot or two at beating them down, or enough to threaten whatever goal the PCs have for the scene. If after a round where everyone got some awesome moves in you realise there's one or two mooks 'left over'? They run away or, if sensible, they were just never there in the first place. <br/>Despite what the game tells you, just having a fight probably isn't enough. It's more fun when the PCs are fighting in the middle of doing something else. Like, say, a wedding, or while on a double date, or grocery shopping, or buying a very expensive and very fragile vase for their mother-in-law.<br/>The system can be gamed, and it really only matters if it results in some players getting way more actions per round -- i.e. way more opportunities to do cool stuff. I've had some bad experiences with this. It not only creates an uneven sense of who is contributing to the game, but it puts the player who has twice as many actions in the position of having to come up with twice as much cool stuff to do.<br/>The actual kung fu paths are not very exciting, with the exception of the ones that let you jump around a lot. Mechanically they tend to only contribute to fights against named NPCs. Contrasting them with the very short list of gun feats is pretty telling in that regard. I haven't played the game enough to offer any solid advice regarding this issue, however.<br/>Similarly, fights against named NPCs really need to be about something other than the fight, because suddenly it's like you're playing D&amp;D again. Everything has hit points. So many hit points. Another issue I've not really solved, personally, which is why the current kung fu game I'm planning is going to be run in Mortal Coil.                        </div>

                            I've been running a frightening amount of Feng Shui recently, and have a couple of tips for streamlining:<br/><br/>Get some big piles of colored rocks/beads/whatever. All the bookkeeping goes much more smoothly if people are moving colored rocks around. This is especially true for combat timing. A bunch of stones for three-shot actions and a few of another color to make change for the little stuff is just easier to deal with.<br/><br/>Divide all those hit point numbers by five, and round in the dramatic direction.<br/><br/>Named characters who go down after being hit a couple of times are a useful in-between type of opponent -- they're a threat, but still a short fight.                        </div>

                            Feng Shui - the archetypes are not game-balanced, some are far more effective than others. Be sure you offset this with some spotlight time changes.                        </div>
