Jared was the free word, and the initial intent was to quickly throw together a kind of American Beauty type game, but it shifted into a teen prom horror story instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is amazing to see how much the insertion of one or two words through a sentence can radically alter it's meaning!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what other versions has anyone tried?

Skype didn't really help with one of the players, as he's much more inclined to sit silently and think, rather than talk it out, and without a visual connection, it made things drag.<br/><br/>The second game took maybe thirty to fourty-five minutes.<br/><br/>But we played again with four people today, and it's probably the best one so far.  I was talking about it to a couple we were hanging out with, and they seemed interested, so I whipped out my palm (it has a Fudge dice roller on it) and took down the story on a paper bag we had just been given for buying some candy.  I'm going to take a scan of the bag tonight and post it somewhere.  I mean, how funny is that?<br/><br/>"I have this brown paper bag and some coins.  Want to play a game?"<br/><br/>The game we played helped me articulate a point I was trying to make about trying to tell a story, but using dice to decide who had what kind of authority.  And one of the players helped me show the other two what changes when someone has a high degree of buy-in.  And also, we had a good time, so win all around.<br/><br/>It played in thirty minutes, and could have gone longer, but we were at a fair ground and I kind of pushed myself into 10 coins so we could get to the conclusion and talk about how it went.  We ended with 10, 6, 5, and 3 coins.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259147/#Comment_259147" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-28T19:34:24+00:00" title="February 28, 2010  7:34PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2010 7:36PM by DanielSolis.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Harlequin</cite>I kind of pushed myself into 10 coins so we could get to the conclusion and talk about how it went.</blockquote>\nThat is one aspect of the game that's been shining in each play. You feel a sense that the story is coming to a conclusion, and it will, but you have a just enough control to decide whether it happens now or one round later if you need a little more time.<br/><br/>If you need a shorter game, you can also just set the time limit to be 7 or 8 coins. That's what I did at Dreamation to play through a 1 hour slot. It worked quite well.<br/><br/>I hope you scan that paper bag, Arnold. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259273/#Comment_259273" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T09:21:50+00:00" title="March  1, 2010  9:21AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 1, 2010 9:23AM by Harlequin.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/arnoldcassell/home/gaming/2-27-2010_a.jpg?attredirects=0" rel="nofollow">beginning</a> and it's <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/arnoldcassell/home/gaming/2-27-2010_b.jpg?attredirects=0" rel="nofollow">conclusion</a> are here.<br/><br/>Since that's hard to read, try <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/arnoldcassell/home/gaming/2-27-2010-HappyBirthdayRobot.pdf?attredirects=0&amp;d=1" rel="nofollow">this</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259303/#Comment_259303" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-01T11:15:55+00:00" title="March  1, 2010 11:15AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the text in that PDF, for everyone else's convenience:<br/><br/>Happy Birthday Robot!<br/>Robot ran into wardrobe trouble at work.<br/>He looked in the dental mirror.<br/>Robot was missing his parachute pants and dentures!<br/>Robot was really happy about missing his party, but his pants were there.<br/>Robot needed to get there soon.<br/>However, Robot's hovercraft was broken but flyable, and he lost his buss pas.<br/>Robot boldly decided to risk flying the broken hovercraft in traffic, but smelled smoke.<br/>Robot was pulled over by a jet powered patrol man, and set him on fire to get away.<br/>Then Robot woke up from his nightmare and called his girlfriend Sarah.<br/>Robot hugged his bear pookie and sobbed.<br/>\u201cCan I have my pants?\u201d<br/>\u201cNO,\u201d said Pookie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
