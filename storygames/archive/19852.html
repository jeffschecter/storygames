Mangelune). I'm a French game designer and an English-French translator (I wrote <i>Les Errants d'Ukiyo</i> for Icare Editions, a game about dramatic wanderers in a feudal Japan in war, and translated many <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> books for Sans Detour Editions). I am very pleased to tell you about the English release of my first indie game, <i>Lost in the Rain</i> (<i>Perdus sous la pluie</i> in French). I hope you will give it a try, and of course that you will enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing and testing it.<br/><br/><b>Lost in the Rain</b><br/><br/>"It is said that children who get lost in the city on a rainy day end up devoured by the sirains. The only way to escape those starving creatures is to find other lost kids and stay close to them at all times.<br/><br/>It is also said that the sirains always find a way to seep into the most closely knit groups. By using evil thoughts, fear, hunger and loneliness, they lure their victims and snatch them, one by one, to devour them in the dark. In the end, only one lost child will find his way home.<br/><br/>The others will never be seen again."<br/><br/><i>Lost in the rain</i> is a short roleplaying game of sadness and horror which invites you to take on the role of a child, lost in the great city and hunted by mysterious creatures.<br/><br/>Those who have never played a RPG before might find this game a bit hard to begin with, but know that it gets more accessible after only one turn. Sharing the narration of the \xab story \xbb allows players to help one another; plus, the short duration of each game makes it perfect for initiations (one hour and a half is the ideal duration). Furthermore, you don\u2019t need any special equipment, funny dice, figures, etc. A few tokens (marbles, stones, paper clips, whatever), some pens and paper, and you\u2019re good to go! Finally, there is no GameMaster: knowing the rules is sufficient to play, and no one has to spend hours preparing an adventure.<br/><br/>For those who have already played \xab more traditional \xbb RPGs (with a pre-written scenario and a GameMaster to decide where to go), <i>Lost in the Rain</i> might also be a bit upsetting. No central facilitator here, no scenario, each player is responsible for his own lost child but also for the story. That doesn\u2019t mean no one is in charge though. When your chapter comes, your character is put in front of the scene and opposed to the avercity, which consists in fact of all the other players; they are in charge of the world that surrounds you and of the terrifying sirains trying to devour you, but also of your perceptions and your evil thoughts. They are the group of children that rejects you. At the end of a chapter, another player\u2019s character is put in front and you join the advercity, ready to take revenge upon this new victim. Unless you\u2019d prefer to sacrifice yourself for him? In that case, you\u2019ll soon discover that children are not always as grateful as you might think\u2026<br/><br/>As a horror game, <i>Lost in the rain</i> also takes advantage of its \xab collective narrator \xbb. Any player can use elements introduced by others, add new details to them, bounce back on others\u2019 ideas or just let them talk while focusing on their own character. One of the scariest parts of the game is when you see one of your creations used against you by someone else, like some Frankenstein\u2019s monster breaking loose from its creator.
