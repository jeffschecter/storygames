From discussions, I'm not the only one who never finishes his games and ends up with a folder with 10 half-done games and nothing to show for. <b>So what's holding us back? <br/></b><br/>For me, it's mostly this notion that Dark Days only has one shot to get out there. It has to be perfect. There has to be an amount of gamers ready to buy the thing even before it's released. I must have an active blog, to gather said gamers and other people and sell them my game. It has to have the best art (that's why I've made 3 covers and commissioned a 4th), the best writing (which is why I've ''edited'' it 5 times) and the best rules. And so on. <br/><br/>No more I say! A single person can't create and publish a game and hope to achieve the same level of success as a whole company (like say...White Wolf). You can't gather a crowd of rabid fans with empty promises and you can't publish a game and expect it to sell 2000 copies just because you think it deserves it.<br/><br/>I'll be cutting down the content in <b>Dark Days</b> and putting together a playtest draft by January. I'll turn the 300 page mammoth to a 50-100 page game and I'll illustrate most of it myself. And then I'll publish it anyway I can.<br/><br/>What about you?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242001/#Comment_242001" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-15T05:22:13+00:00" title="November 15, 2009  5:22AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me it'a playtesters.

There just aren't enough hours in the day to adequately address everything important in my life, and right now I prioritize my grad school work, my girlfriend and personal downtime over other things. The time that I do have to spend on "game stuff" right now is pretty much devoted to upkeeping my current stuff and the occasional lark like Two Games One Name.<br/><br/>Two things I've realized that helps me not stress about it, though:<br/><br/>* In the words of Mr. Jared A. Sorensen, Good is the Enemy of Done. If it's Brilliant and never gets out there, that's worse than something that's Very Good and people have the chance to experience. Also, no matter how much playtesting is involved, you will always learn things about your game from it being out in the wild. Always. <br/><br/>*It'll still be there. If I don't get my next game done by Christmas? Well, I can get it done by the summer. Not done by the summer? Next halloween. People will still be playing games. I'll still be here. It'll be ok. I have a secret project that I've been working on with a partner for almost two years now. Neither of us have a lot of time to spare. We originally were aiming for last Gen Con - hell, the design isn't even done yet. It's sure as hell not written. That's ok, it's gonna be a really good game, and it'll still be good in another two years.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242013/#Comment_242013" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-15T08:13:50+00:00" title="November 15, 2009  8:13AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan P.</cite>Time and priorities.</blockquote>\n++                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242014/#Comment_242014" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-15T08:17:03+00:00" title="November 15, 2009  8:17AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 15, 2009 8:21AM by Cedric P.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playtesting. Finding french speaking players to play regular indies game in Montreal is kind of hard. Still, I have managed to find two gaming groups, one play once a week, the other play once by two weeks. Those two group have a playlist of like 10+ indies games they want to try and play. With all those indies games to try (they are legion! ;-), I dont see how one of my group would have some time to playtest something. <br/><br/>This is a huge stoping force for me since I really prefer to work by trial and error and experimenting over alway working on a pure theoric level. I am often considering of dropping my projects and I regularly shelve them, but sadly I also alway get back to them. I think I should invest my energy in other activity where I dont depend on a group of people to work, like illustration artwork, graphic novels, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242020/#Comment_242020" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-15T08:56:11+00:00" title="November 15, 2009  8:56AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Time.

What's stopping you from finding playtesters? What's your game about?</blockquote>\nI live in rural Kentucky. The play group that I had going since 1996 finally grew old, got careers, and moved away.  During those years I'd estimate 20 different people filtered through my group.  But at some point, the well went dry. I'm still looking for a partner, but no luck so far.<br/><br/>I have two games I'm currently looking to playtest.  The first is called, "No Greater Love."  It's my attempt to take a the types of issues and conflicts faced by the character's in Frank Miller's <i>Sin City</i> and force the players to address them through play.  The second game ready to go is one born out of my current necessity.  It's called "Solo."  It's intended for one GM and one Player.  It's a high-adventure heroic game intended to work with different plug-in modules to keep things fresh.  I've actualyl playtested the mechanics for this game quite extensively for another design that didn't work out the way I wanted.  So I have a basic idea that it'll work, but I've never played it with just one Player.<br/><br/>I've noticed that the three main placed people get stuck are Completion of the First Draft, Playtesting, Massive Revision based on Playtesting.  That's been my experience anyway. <br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242041/#Comment_242041" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-15T11:02:29+00:00" title="November 15, 2009 11:02AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still exploring the games that are out there, I have a few scattered notes and an old few drafts but I right now I"m still really happy exploring rather than inventing brilliant designs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242049/#Comment_242049" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-15T12:02:05+00:00" title="November 15, 2009 12:02PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't put out Console:Sidearm because I want good artwork for it.

I've got a full time job that is pretty demanding and my wife is in grad school (again). The game business comes in third (or fourth and ocassionally fifth). Yesterday I watched the last Matrix movie rather than work on games (a poor choice).<br/><br/>I do move forward though because I have a good quality - blind presistence. I'm certain it's mild OCD but it means I return to the project over and over and the small work adds up over time. Sometimes I fear failure, sometimes I fear success. After those two emotions pass I get back to work.<br/><br/>The fun part is the writing and play testing. Production is less fun but I kind of like the feeling of accomplishment it gives. Getting the web page up and maintained is draining. Marketing is hard. At least I don't mind the accounting anymore.<br/><br/>In the end I think the thing that stops most design work is our deciding to dedicate our lives to other things. Really making it a business is not what people want. There is nothing wrong with that but I understand why it makes stores look so ask ance at small companies. Being "real" is nothing more or less than remaining in business and being predictable. Until you know yourself that you are going to do this then why should the wider world pay attention. Unsupported games don't draw players - espeically fringe games.<br/><br/>I'm personally going to push forward as best I can and let God sort it out. I'm just the grunt.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242140/#Comment_242140" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-16T06:49:59+00:00" title="November 16, 2009  6:49AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since I had several people ask about Console:Sidearm in whispers:<br/><br/>Sidearm is a game that fuses console RPGs and westerns. (Not western RPGs as in Ultima, Wizardry, etc., but westerns as in The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly.) Gameplay works through poker cards, characters go to 99th level as in many console RPGs, fights take place on a battlefield shaped like a revolver's cylinder, all sorts of stuff together. The Wild Arms series (especially 3) is the exemplar for Sidearm, in the same way that FF7 and ChronoTrigger were the exemplars for previous versions of Console. The anime Trigun is a pretty good example too. <br/><br/>Those art styles are what would be ideal for the game. Anime-style art with western-style characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DVUS" title="DVUS"><img alt="DVUS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3459/3796518754_5531e4a169_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DVUS">DVUS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242143/#Comment_242143" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-16T07:02:29+00:00" title="November 16, 2009  7:02AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Time and, honestly, fear that it will suck.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I've identified my problems, it should be easy to take care of, right?

As a result, my projects often end up in sort of rules design limbo.  Long before Jared Sorensen wrote InSpectres, I started a project of creating my own Ghostbusters-esque game; this was also before I lost interest in traditional gaming models.  In the years on which I worked on that project, I flip-flopped between no less than 5 different systems, over the course of ten years.  Then I discovered the wonder of hippie games, and the elegance of InSpectres; not long afterwards I gave up that long frustrating project for good.  I have no regrets about letting go.  The condition still afflicts me, but in slightly different ways; as I hash out one element of a game, I notice that another element doesn't work as well as desired with the new one, and so I revise the old element.  I suspect that's not an uncommon occurence for a lot of designers; but I think I do it really often.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm working hard to get past these challenges, and become a more effective designer.  I've focused on one project exclusively for a while now; a while being since Game Chef 2009 started.  The game I produced for GC09, titled Slow Burn, is now my big focus.  I've got a new website for myself where I can announce my game design work, and also perform my design work since the site uses a wiki style backend.  Slow Burn is the only project on my site, which is helping to maintain my focus.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting things playtested still remains my number one challenge.  Up here in Kitchener (Ontario, Canada), there are few players of story games. I was lucky enough to find Kit and Anna Kreider, who have been great to game with; I've been having a blast.  I'm acquainted with a bunch of other gamers in the area, but they are all traditional gamers, and tend to be reluctant to try the non-traditional stuff.  I'm going to have work on some of the suggestions in the finding playtesters thread over in Praxis to increase my playtesting opportunities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242207/#Comment_242207" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-16T11:24:19+00:00" title="November 16, 2009 11:24AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't finish most of my games.

It lacks artwork (or permission to use the inspirational artwork, it being an Artists First submission) and probably another editorial pass. And layout, but I can do that easy-peasie. The main lack of motivation to Finish It: it's free, Creative Commons, and is already published online in a playable state. Any more work on it takes away from:<br/><br/><i>GLASS</i> - I think it's done, system-wise. But I need to playtest, and being a LARP,, that means a largish venue and a full game session for which I charge no fees. THAT adds up to Money. If I could get (a) a few full-weekend playtest and (b) a few folks just cranking out characters, trying to 'break' the system with min-max munchkinly tricks, then I could move on to full rules writing and examples and Templates with the confidence that I won't have to change some of the cost balances and, thus, search and recalculate umpty-dozen examples of an Ability whose cost has changed. Basically, if the system isn't solid, there's no point in expanding the rules yet.<br/><br/><i>ASCII <a href="/forums/profile/HACK">@HACK</a></i> - This roguelike Story Now game is... in need of a major redesign, after one good (but woeful) playtest. I think I learned a lot about how to balance resource-driven tactcs and actual narration (though I don't have a "killer app" that mechanically encourages narration, like DitV dice and Trait invocations).<br/><br/><i>Icehouse Games</i> - Most are "playable-done" but could use either Variation rules or final tweaks to maximize the strategy. Others are "interesting ideas" that are far from fully baked (e.g. generic RPG using only Icehouse pyramids for all "stats," characters/monsters, and challenges). The rest are done as they'll ever be--some perfectly fine and playable, others more in the "game experiment" category that are fun for some folks and an utter waste of time for others.<br/><br/>In closing... time and friends. I can make the former, but I have to pay for the latter (it would seem). Lacking the latter, I don't bother allocating the former.

I've been struggling with mental illness since I disappeared from the Forge.  Setting medication levels for anti-anxiety drugs is hard; either you can't stop from committing to insane stuff or you have no will to commit to anything.  Now after tinkering for years, I hover around 'why bother' and 'today I'll try'.<br/><br/>"Stab them in the Hope with your Ennui" is kinda poetic for me.  Ennui is a good way to describe my problem.<br/><br/>Even so, over the years, I've had the inspirations that finished Scattershot.  I'm so out of practice now.  Ennui and meeting people in meatspace don't mix, so I'm beginning to reach out for blind playtesters.<br/><br/>Reading this thread makes me think that what a lot of us would benefit from would be something like a 'writing buddy'.  Another person who you work with, not on your game, but on your progress.  When George said, "What's stopping you from finding playtesters?" I heard exactly that kind of input.  I would like to find someone who regularly grabs me by the ears and asks those ridiculously obvious questions.  It shakes up one's thinking and makes the next step clear.  It's like having a deadline that thinks.  And I could ask just the same kind of questions from her.  Since we share the hobby, we can both relate and learn what the process is to publish a game.<br/><br/>Does anyone else think this would be something we could put together here on Story

'writing buddy'.  Another person who you work with, not on your game, but on your progress.  When George said, "What's stopping you from finding playtesters?" I heard exactly that kind of input.  I would like to find someone who regularly grabs me by the ears and asks those ridiculously obvious questions.  It shakes up one's thinking and makes the next step clear.  It's like having a deadline that thinks.  And I could ask just the same kind of questions from her.  Since we share the hobby, we can both relate and learn what the process is to publish a game.<br/><br/>Does anyone else think this would be something we could put together here on Story Games?<br/></blockquote>\nHmm, this sounds very familiar.  I must have read on some boards, listened to a podcast or maybe it was a GamesChef...  Anyway, the idea was that a small group of designers got together (Internet or meatspace) and everyone have someone else that you should ask about progress and cheer on. The same time you have someone who asks you how the project goes, looks at the stuff that you release and give feedback. Not necessarily editing/proofreading, just looking.  That way everyone knows that there is someone out there that waits for the next progress report, wants to hear about the new mechanics or can provide some feedback on that new page layout.<br/><br/>It seemed like a nice system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242527/#Comment_242527" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T04:51:07+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  4:51AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Working with a writing buddy seems good.

And, maybe more usefully, there are lots of folks who will do it for you for a reasonable fee or as part of a collaboration -- think of it more as artwork than part of the writing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_242566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242566/#Comment_242566" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T08:38:38+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  8:38AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Fang Langford</cite>My problem? I've been struggling with mental illness since I disappeared from the Forge. Setting medication levels for anti-anxiety drugs is hard; either you can't stop from committing to insane stuff or you have no will to commit to anything. Now after tinkering for years, I hover around 'why bother' and 'today I'll try'.<br/><br/>"Stab them in the Hope with your Ennui" is kinda poetic for me. Ennui is a good way to describe my problem.<br/><br/>Even so, over the years, I've had the inspirations that finished Scattershot. I'm so out of practice now. Ennui and meeting people in meatspace don't mix, so I'm beginning to reach out for blind playtesters.<br/><br/>Reading this thread makes me think that what a lot of us would benefit from would be something like a 'writing buddy'. Another person who you work with, not on your game, but on your progress. When George said, "What's stopping you from finding playtesters?" I heard exactly that kind of input. I would like to find someone who regularly grabs me by the ears and asks those ridiculously obvious questions. It shakes up one's thinking and makes the next step clear. It's like having a deadline that thinks. And I could ask just the same kind of questions from her. Since we share the hobby, we can both relate and learn what the process is to publish a game.<br/><br/>Does anyone else think this would be something we could put together here on Story Games?<br/><br/>Fang Langford</blockquote>\nI'll take the lead on this. <br/><br/>Once a week I'll post a thread on the list in which people can introduce themselves - say what they are working on - say what they got done in the last week - say what they want to get done by next week (a commitment) - and say what is blocking them.<br/><br/>People can comment, give encouragement, and give advice (with the understanding that noone has to follow it!)<br/><br/>Anyone can post on the thread but I hope that a set number of people would consistently post. If we do that would create a strong primary group that would give everyone more energy.<br/><br/>One last thing is that this group would not be a competition. The only person we compete with is ourselves. As they say in my religion this is a jihad of the self, which is the noblest of all struggles.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_242619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/242619/#Comment_242619" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-18T14:25:13+00:00" title="November 18, 2009  2:25PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2009 2:30PM by blankshield.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For most of my ideas/projects?

The same time you have someone who asks you how the project goes, looks at the stuff that you release and give feedback. Not necessarily editing/proofreading, just looking.
