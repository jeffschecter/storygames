I have played the game with a couple of different groups , <br/>\nand have used anything from 30 to 10 members in the troopers in the unit. In the beginning these are faceless, nameless npc's and I usually just mention the numbers to the players.<br/>\n<br/>\n"You grunts belong to a unit of 20 troopers sent to secure this planet".<br/>\n<br/>\nI quickly start making the players define their fellow soldiers by asking questions such as "How are the other troopers doing during the drop", and when one of the players answer "the one beside me does not seem to be doing so well", I follow up with "Who is that? "Describe and name him or her". Usually it ends up being a fun little situation in itself, that helps define the npc a little, and more than a few times sets up the relationship between the player-character and that npc. I've found that giving npc's "a face" this way is much more rewarding than me as a gm making them up (either by prep, or on the spot), because the players will have some kind of connection to them from the get-go (even it it is a little as "I made that one up"), and this is not to be underestimated.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery time such an opportunity surfaces I make the players define another npc themselves until each player has defined a couple of npc's each. The rest we let stay anonymous for now until we need another few to fill up our "pool" of npc troopers (more on that below).<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing as  the Sergeant has the order to protect his troopers, ("Order 4: Protect your squad of Troopers") we felt that it would increase tension to have a mechanic that put a little spotlight on how well he did that job. <br/>\nTherefore we decided that every time a character is "crippled" the player also has to narrate the death of one of his fellow npc troopers. We decided that you had to start with named npc's before narrating the death of any "anonymous" npc's.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis quickly took on a life of it's own, as it quickly added more color to our games. Players would often pick off hated npc's before ones that their character had some kind of connection to, but seeing that the players had different "favorites" it often led to increased drama in the sessions. We experienced players ticking off their "Armour" instead of becoming "Crippled" just to save the life of a named npc (and of course made sure this sacrifice made it into the narration). We also have had tension between the players express itself through this mechanic. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne incident in particular comes to mind here:<br/>\nOne session started with a very long "color scene" (several hours in fact) before even starting the first encounter. The units Sergeant, a not so bright bully, was outsmarted several times and made to look very bad in front of his superiors by the units resident brainy-character. The "Brain" had developed a romantic-connection to one of the named npc's during the last few missions, going from dislike, into grudging respect and eventually budding love-interest between the two characters. <br/>\nDuring a following encounter the player playing the Sergeant was wounded and stated that he would cross out his "Crippled" box instead of his "Armour". He looked over at the player playing "Brains" and in that moment everyone around the table understood what was going to happen. The Sergeant of cource decided to narrate the death of "Brains" love-interest in the most gruesome way. I have to state that both players were ok with afterward, we have discussed it and they both stated that it was one of the most intense and rewarding 3:16 moments yet. This was done in a way that heightened tension, and brought a even greater sense of drama and tragedy into the session seeing as the player choose to narrate it so that is seemed the Sergeant could have rescued the "love-interest" npc, but choose not to. The relationship between the Sergeant (now Lieutenant) and "Brains" has since been a source of much in-game drama, and is enjoyed greatly by both players.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I mention this is because I'm not sure if this could have happened at all if I as a GM had created the npc's, and decided who died and lived, for one I might never have considered the opportunity, and being very a soft-hearted GM I might never have had the nerve to let the game go into that "grim" direction.  Also I think the impact would have been much less if it was me as a GM who decided to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust wanted to share our experiences with this great game here, and since this has worked so great for us I'm hoping it may be interesting for other 3:16 players.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289548/#Comment_289548" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T07:09:37+00:00" title="August 29, 2010  7:09AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never played 3:16,  but this sounds awesome.

That is, under certain circumstances, players will care more about NPCs' well-being even more than their own characters. I remember a friend of mine saying that one time he played a D&amp;D game with super-high powered characters, and the way it went, the GM ended up treating these characters' NPC friends as a kind of resource like hit points, which the players were afraid of losing, because the PCs themselveswere so unbeatable, but the NPCs were vulnerable and the PCs cared about them. <br/><br/>At the time, I thought it was just something this one good GM did that one time. But in fact it is something that, like you said, can be codified into game mechanics. I'd really love to see a game designed with this in mind. To a certain extent (maybe to a large extent?) it seems that Apocalypse World has this element in its design, that players often end up caring about the NPCs a lot. Still, I don't think AW's way is the only way to do it. There must be many more good ways we haven't thought of yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rune" title="Rune"><img alt="Rune" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rune">Rune</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289562/#Comment_289562" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-29T08:19:19+00:00" title="August 29, 2010  8:19AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @Paul<br/>\nI have played the game with a few different groups now, in my regular group of players most of them have either been playing minis (40K or WFB) or a few sci-fi rpg's. I guess they felt quite comfortable with the setting, and there was little or no insecurity about the genre in itself. Here we most commonly are 5-6 players. <br/>\nI have also played it with people less familiar with the Space Marine-genre, but seeing as we create much of the setting together I think the players insecurity about the genre lessened considerably. If they wanted something in there (the setting) they could just suggest it, and thus create some of their own familiar "pegs" to hang their ideas on.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the initial insecurity in my regular gaming group came from the fact that we are all used to more traditional games, and 3:16 was the first story-game we attempted to play. Some players were put a little bit off by what they perceived as "very simple rules", and the banality of the setting "so it's only about killing stuff?".<br/>\nI had suspicions that there would be much more to the game than "killing aliens", but I decided not to push this idea onto the players at first, as I wanted to see if this occurred in play without me "planting" my ideas there beforehand.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily it did, and as we played out planet after planet the "free play" in between encounters became more and more important to the story we wanted to tell. It changed from mostly being a macho and guns-blazing game, to something darker, more cynical and tragic. The sessions still have "gung-ho" moments, but they seem much more symbolic in a way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we quickly grasped that these rules helped us create moments in our sessions that were fun, unexpected, dramatic, tense aso. And so we decided to try to add a few rules ourselves, but only if they "helped us tell the story" as we so naively stated. Another rule we have held on to is that rolling a 10 on the die allows the player to narrate some kind of "critical failure". And rolling several 10's in a row would only escalate the situation. This does not happen often, but have allowed for a few absurd situations that I'm sure none of us would have the guts to push trough into the story otherwise. Now they are almost expected by the other players; the spotlight is immediately moved to the player rolling a 10, and broad smiles spread across the other players faces as they anticipate the mayhem to ensue. Now the player feels he can embellish on the failure without taking time from the "important story" or derailing the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mordheim" title="mordheim"><img alt="mordheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.darkreign40k.com/drjoomla/images/comprofiler/tn62_47cea863027df.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mordheim">mordheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289717/#Comment_289717" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-30T00:42:19+00:00" title="August 30, 2010 12:42AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2010 12:43AM by mordheim.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Rune,<br/><br/>I have cross-posted your write-up to the 3:16 fansite 316carnage.com.
