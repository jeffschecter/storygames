Not entirely trivial. Can't remember which it was, but it was probably e-Commerce. Might have been that it didn't like my theme design.<br/><br/>This isn't an option for everybody, but I fould creating my own cart system from scratch an interesting exercise in web programming (not talking of the English site, but of the Finnish one - it's running a simple shopping cart nowadays). The basic theory is simple, after all. I'm thinking of making a more elaborate shopping system for our English-language store as well, but I've yet to decide if I want to make it out of scratch to get exactly what I want, or whether I should use a prebuilt solution. The advantage of latter is an ample and detailed set of features, the advantage of former is infinite expandability and easy maintenance - much easier to modify code you've written yourself.<br/><br/>However, the most important bit: if you only have half a dozen products or so, Graham, my recommendation is to forego a shopping cart solution and just use simple Paypal buttons on a web page. That's how our English sales work at the moment (<a href="http://www.arkenstonepublishing.net/shop" rel="nofollow">here</a>), and I have to say that the solution is entirely satisfactory - I wouldn't be considering a more elaborate store set-up if I wasn't also considering opening up our retail selection to the English audience - not having a dedicated store solution isn't so good if you have dozens of products. Also note the Paypal ability to run a pseudo-cart for you, as implemented on our shopping page: the only thing you need to do is to put the buttons for adding stuff to the cart and viewing the cart on your page, and Paypal takes care of the rest. It's not extremely sleek and Paypal is rather primitive about calculating shipping, but for simple needs it's sufficient - I wouldn't expect an individual indie publisher to need a dedicated shopping cart solution when they can do something like that. Limits you to Paypal insofar as payment options go, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278291/#Comment_278291" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T09:56:40+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  9:56AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2010 9:58AM by Graham.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm seriously thinking about just using PayPal.

I considered putting something together for the English-language Arkenstone store, but didn't find it worthwhile with just a couple of products - you'd need to keep a strict customer database with download rights, which is pretty involved compared to fire-and-forget sales. A package solution is probably the best bet there.<br/><br/>Then again, I could see hooking up an automatic script for the <a href="http://theunstore.com/bookshelf/" rel="nofollow">Forge Bookshelf</a>. I haven't looked into how the bookshelf works, exactly, but if there's some way to automate authorization and do it without human intervention, then it'd be simple to hook a script into the transaction confirmation Paypal sends to your server after the payment. That is, after the payment has concluded, your server would just need to tell the Forge bookshelf to authorize the customer and then send an email about it to him (which the bookshelf might do automatically, I don't remember). Relatively straightforward when the content delivery backend with customer registry, file storage and such is handled by the Forge Bookshelf. The main sticking point would be how the bookshelf takes authorizations, exactly - can you just stick an authorization password of some sort and the customer's email address into a URL string and ping the bookshelf with it or what, no idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278299/#Comment_278299" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T10:23:08+00:00" title="June 28, 2010 10:23AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>The only drawback is that they don't use Digital Content Delivery (i.e. getting your PDF immediately after you've paid for it).</blockquote>\nI was about to point that out about Paypal- it's why I built a shopping cart system for Bully Pulpit initially, before we started working with IPR.

In fact, in my copious free time, I think I'll write a WordPress plugin for that. Expect it sometime after all of my children are out of diapers, say in 2013? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>EDIT TO ADD ADDITIONALLY: Actually, PayFlow Link, PayPal's simplest integrated payment solution, calls a URL of your choice as part of its success behavior. Have it talk to a REST endpoint on your website that creates the appropriate file/DB records and you're done.<br/><br/>EDIT TO ADD ADDITIONAL ADDITIONS: You don't even need to do that. You can just set the Return URL in PayPal to that REST endpoint. Its behavior is to update the customer DB and then serve up a page with a link to the content; that page's backend logic can do the personalization of the PDF or whatever else you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
