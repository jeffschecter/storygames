I'm a Story Games collector so I'm a pretty easy sell. Here are the type of games I like, but that doesn't mean these are the only type of games I'm interested in, so don't be hesitant to post your game and some info about it if you like. Here's the type of games I typically like:<br/><br/>- GMless / GMlite games in which the players don't just advocate for their players via their players POV, but also equally contribute to other parts of the story and tell it together. The players typically take turns framing scenes and play their characters while simultaneously directing the narrative, world-building, playing NPCs and taking on other roles that are traditionally left to the GM. They are the writers of the story in the largest sense and also its audience. <br/><br/>- I typically like narrative based story games rather simulationist RPG's <br/><br/>- Finally, I typically prefer simple rules and games that are played in a single session as one shots, or games that are played in a few sessions.<br/><br/>As I said, these are just general guidelines of what I typically like in games, but if your game doesn't fit this criteria, it doesn't mean I won't like it, so if you would like please tell me about it <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/><br/><br/>Now, please sell me your games! <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464475/#Comment_464475" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-29T22:38:04+00:00" title="June 29, 2017 10:38PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2017 10:38PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited June 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is totally for the sake of perverse sadism, but were you aware of one of my funkier designs, <a href="http://www.arkkikivi.net/julkaisut/julenius" rel="nofollow">Fellows of the Julenius Archive</a>?

I own the big <b>Protocol</b> book and Joan of Arc is actually in it. You reminded me that I still haven't played <b>Protocol</b> yet. I will likely play it at SG SLC in the next couple weeks; I'll probably go with the Joan of Arc scenario\u2014because of your recommendation\u2014unless you'd suggest something else?

It still takes concentration and real skill from the players to play the game correctly, though. There's some notes about adapting the game to a different milieu in there somewhere - I assume that Americans would play it as an "X-Files" adaptation, as all the backstory stuff in the game about the Finnish equivalent is, well, just a lot of text to justify an X-Files-like premise set in Finland [grin].<br/><br/>It's a free game, you can download the entire thing from that page. There is a paper book ("Wildwood Tales", a big book of rural folklore from Finnish backwoods), but I think it's practically out of print. I probably have a box of them sitting around somewhere, but I'm saving those for a rainy day for now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464536/#Comment_464536" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-01T17:07:34+00:00" title="July  1, 2017  5:07PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 1, 2017 5:08PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> <br/>Cool Eero!

Characters have skills with pips that correspond to d10 dice pools. Roll against a Target Number and take the single highest result. It just isn't narratively driven or anything.

I have a story game called The Box that is in blind playtesting stages now.  The rules, process, and cards are complete, I'm just working on layout, art, and small tweaks to wording.  The Box fits your criteria perfectly, and I'd love to get feedback from an experienced story gamer like yourself!<br/><br/>You and your group will collectively discover a strange box, open it, and unpack an estoteric object from inside.  Then you will go through a divination process to discover its true nature or purpose.<br/><br/>The gameplay mostly consists of describing individual elements of the things and events you encounter, and is less focused on characters.  It's very easy to set up and play, has a cooperative or competitive mode, and even has built-in scenarios to get you started!  If you're interested, you can download the rule book and card sheets here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/8kmdnjzwbivbgr6/THE_BOX_-_Rule_Book_%26_Cards.zip" rel="nofollow">THE BOX - An Object Discovery Game</a><br/><br/>Let me know what you and your group think if you're able to get a session in!

I don't think there's a ton you can do about this within the game's framework, and that's OK. It is utterly unworkable if you play to fail, because you can't really fail that much in Fate. You can trust me on this because I have pushed pretty hard and the results are always frustrating and lukewarm as you build a mountain of self-compel fate points."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465011/#Comment_465011" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-24T22:06:37+00:00" title="July 24, 2017 10:06PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I went on and read the whole thread. Very interesting! <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/>If I have to trace some distinctions between Fate/FAE and FateLess based on what was expressed in the thread...<br/><br/>Fate's performance varies depending on how the GM handles the rules.<br/><br/><b>FateLess</b> sears away this variance. There is no  GM <img alt=":neutral:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/neutral.png" title=":neutral:"/> <br/><br/>Fate can end up being about Wolverine's claws.<br/><br/><b>FateLess</b> is by design much more about "shit happening" which in turn makes the PCs change and evolve. It's cool that Wolverine has claws, but the focus of the game is on <i>what</i> he does with his claws, <i>how</i> he does it, what <i>consequences</i> this causes, and how Wolverine's <b>goals</b> and <b>motives</b> change because of that.<br/><br/>Fate frames dice rolls as conflicts of some kind, where the only chance of "failure" is presented by a bad dice roll. This in turn is drastically reduced by the use of Fate Points and other mechanics.<br/><br/><b>FateLess</b> frames dice rolls as "critical tasks" ... this (I have seen at the table) tends to make things faster by reducing the scope of the dice roll, while keeping them meaningful.<br/>You still have tools, like Fate Points, to tilt the balance in your favour but:<br/><br/>- it's much more common for PCs to not be in a group, so pooling resources and help is much less common<br/><br/>- there are mechanics in place that have "bad" things happen independently of the dice roll, so you could succeed at impressing the girl at the bar, but something else might also happen to complicate the situation, or rise the stakes, or impose a price, or plain and simple reveal new unexpected info (which change the fictional positioning, so dice or no dice you might feel like riconsidering your actions and goals)<br/><br/>- there is no Stress or Shifts or Boxes of any kind... PCs can only sustain 3 Consequences, and the 4th one sends them "KO" ... and all kinds of "damage" (physical, social, or else) translate into Consequences.<br/>So while it is possible to often succeed at rolls, it is also true that a single failure has a lot of weight.<br/>Not to mention that pure and simple fictional positioning is more than enough to inflict a Consequence. Of course the target PC would be allowed to act in some way to prevent it.<br/><br/>The net result in my experience is that although it is not easy to <b>mechanically</b> fail and end up KO, the Players <b>feel</b> plenty of challenge.<br/>The danger is real, and it is clearly perceived, although the odds are stacked in favour of the PCs, if they are willing to put effort into it. Usually, this effort is less about spending points, and more about coming up with genuine ideas ... fictional positioning plays a huge role here.<br/><br/>I personally find this is the case in Fate only under the guidance of a GM that is both skilled and has the right sensibilities and inclination. In FateLess it's the default.<br/><br/>That said, <b>FateLess</b> is still by design a "pulp" game.<br/>The interesting question is not to know IF a character will be able to achieve something. They might fail, but it's more likely that <b>eventually</b> they will succeed.<br/>No, the point of the game is rather everything else around such event:<br/>- how will the PC choose/manage to get to the goal?<br/>- what is the PC willing to do to get there?<br/>- getting to the goal changes the situation, how will the PC handle it?<br/>- what will happen after the goal is achieved?<br/><br/>. . .<br/><br/>I don't know. Does this sound a bit more like what you were looking for?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
