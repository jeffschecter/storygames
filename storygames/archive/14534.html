You kill your mother instead! Or best friend, if mother isn't present.<br/>4 Yes, and no! But!<br/>5 You impale a limb and pin them to the wall!<br/>6 Roll twice, choose result.</blockquote>- and this example of play:<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Example of play:<br/><br/>Bobby and Karen are playing a game set in our world, our time. Their characters are Gustav and Friedrich, brothers, in their eighties. Gustav and Friedrich are sitting on a bench in the park.<br/><br/>Bobby: "Gustav is feeding the pigeons." He rolls a 1: Chop their head off! The pigeons die.<br/><br/>Karen: "Friedrich looks at you and asks: Why did you do that, Gustav?" She rolls a 2: HEART EXPLODES. She rolls to see whose heart, and it's Friedrich's.<br/><br/>Bobby: "Gustav sees you keel over. He turns pale and bends over your dead body." He rolls a 6: Roll twice, choose result. Another 6! Then he rolls 2, 2, 3. Will he kill his best friend (mother isn't present), or have his heart explode? A TOUGH NARRATIVE CHOICE. He decides to kill his best friend. "I call up Johan and tell him Friedrich is dead. Johan can't take the news, and he dies!"<br/><br/>Bobby stays quiet for a while, to make sure his character lives a little longer. Then he goes into passive narration, because he's such a munchkin. "The funeral was small, modest and quiet. In a few years, the cure for old age was finally found. As time went by, Gustav felt younger and youn-"<br/><br/>Karen: "Hah! HE FEELS SOMETHING! That's an action!"<br/><br/>Bobby: "Oh crap." He rolls a die, and gets a 6. Followed by 1 and 5. "Who's 'they'? I'm alone in this scene!"<br/><br/>Karen: "That means it's YOU!"<br/><br/>Bobby: "Oh crap. Okay, I impale a limb and pin myself to the wall."<br/><br/>Karen: "And then what?"<br/><br/>Bobby: "I wait. Oh, that's an action too." He rolls a 3. "Um, I already killed my best friend. And my mother still isn't present."<br/><br/>They house rule it, and let him reroll. 2.<br/><br/>Bobby: "MY HEART EXPLODES!"<br/><br/>End of game.</blockquote>- I propose for this thread to be dedicated to "table games" (that is: role-playing games with heavy emphasis on the use of critical hit tables and the like ...). <br/><br/><b>Make it playable!</b><br/><i>(or at least fun to read)</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
