But that was, fortunately, ok.<br/><br/>We had: Lady Blackbird (a new gamer), Snargle (an old gamer, very outgoing), and Cyrus Vance (a new-to-non-D&amp;D gamer).<br/><br/>The group managed to get away from the Hand of Sorrow in a timely, although difficult, manner, which required the Hand to fall under attack due to some slowdown in creativity at the beginning (and a lot of bad dice). Luckily, in the confusion, the group found its footing, and began to start the story moving forward.<br/><br/>Lady Blackbird took on the role of the person who moved the plot forward, but didn't really get her own strong subplot.<br/><br/>Snargle began to question her place in the universe, and matters of justice and loyalty because...<br/><br/>Cyrus Vance began to question good and evil, loyalty and honesty, as he was shown to be the former Captain of the Hand of Sorrow, who had abandoned them to the depths, and they barely survived (he'd constantly passed rolls to know the ship, he'd constantly been shown to hold rank, and so on), and that he was known to be ruthless, and more than a little dangerous.<br/><br/>As Snargle and Vance did their dance, Snargle very nearly left the Owl to its fate, but remained loyal to her captain, despite mistrust.<br/><br/>All in all - it went really well, whole swathes of the game weren't used, which is amazing considering how short it is, but it's a really good exercise in design.<br/><br/>My favourite moment (as a GM) was the moment where I started asking player's to narrate other player's failures. Snargle wanted to know Vance's reputation around Nightport, and so began to look into it, only to fail. So - I asked Cyrus to say what was said about him, letting him take the reigns of his own story.<br/><br/>I am really curious about how this might work, and if it might be possible to hack Lady Blackbird into a GMless game, taking advantage of these pieces.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385984/#Comment_385984" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-30T13:58:07+00:00" title="July 30, 2012  1:58PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that's a great take on Vance. Nicely done, Vance's player!<br/><br/>I assume they were hitting their keys like crazy. It sounds like it.<br/><br/>A GMless version of the game is totally doable. In fact, it's been done! Maybe one of those brave souls will come along and post about it.
