<a href="/forums/profile/moconnor">@moconnor</a>,<br/><br/>This is a really tidy and well put together game! I would play this. Really slick. The way sorcery works, for example, is very elegant.<br/><br/>My main worries would be about how the more mechanical aspects of the game would align with the "fictional problem solving" design of many modules, and if they ever lead to funny results in play. (For instance, does running out of food and grog usually cause you to flee the dungeon or environment as soon as possible?)<br/><br/>Very nice.<br/><br/> </div>

<div class="Message">
<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>  Thanks!  The other thing I'm really happy with are the monster stat rules.
<blockquote><br/><b>Stat Monsters</b> <br/>You can do this ahead of time or on the fly.	<br/><br/>For each monster, write 2-8 moves it might make.	<br/> <i>Kobold: threaten, throw bombs, swarm<br/>           Spider: pounce, poison, bind, trap, bite	</i><br/><br/>When monsters act, choose an item off the list.	<br/>When a goblin succeeds on an action against a monster, cross off one of its moves.	<br/>When it has no (uncrossed) moves that make sense in the situation, it runs away.	<br/>When all of its moves are crossed out, it dies.	<br/></blockquote>
For the problem solving stuff, it's important that some things can be resolved without a roll.
<blockquote><br/>If a player describes a clever solution to a problem or otherwise circumvents a danger, then they overcome the problem without a roll.<br/>This can keep the pace brisk and reward players for engaging with the fiction.	<br/>If they describe sacrificing gear to do this, the gear is lost but the roll is still avoided.<br/></blockquote>
So if the players figure out the trap, or secret door, or tense negotiation, that's great.  When things don't go their way, they still have some interesting choices with fortune-in-the-middle resolution.<br/><br/>On the final point, that the goblins sometimes have to flee back to town to spend their coin and buy more stuff is he system working as intended.  I might try to provide some more clarity on player-control of pacing.  Whether to keep hanging out in this dungeon or go home should be a rolling decision point.                        </div>

                            Yes, I really liked the monster rules, as well! A very clever way to build in morale rules to this ruleset.<br/><br/>I suppose the possible downside of the way rolls work is that it isn't always clear to the group when we should go to the dice and when we should "overcome the problem without a roll". I trust a smart group to figure this out, but making it similarly clear and easy to remember would take this ruleset from Good to Great.<br/><br/>I suspect that, in actual play, being able to really nail that every time is what will make this game really sing.                        </div>

                            So more, less important thoughts:<br/><br/>1. The correct spelling is "achieved". (If you care about typos!)<br/><br/>2. Perhaps the "skip the roll sometimes" advice should be higher in the flowchart, not AFTER the procedure for making the roll.<br/><br/>3. The way armour works is really neat. <br/><br/>(Though I do wonder about how we decide when to use it - I could see players wrangling it into all kinds of rolls, which could or could not be what you want. But it's probably just fine.)<br/><br/>4. "Using Sorcery" on a roll is a bit confusing. There's an implication that you could choose to do this just about anytime, but the only "sorcery" I see in the rules are predetermined spells. It seems strange to suddenly ask whether "they'd like to consider using sorcery" during a roll - surely, by then, that would have been settled? And I don't see most of the spells being used actually being risky, so I wouldn't expect to roll just to use a spell.<br/><br/>Is your intention that the Sorcery category might come into effect *after* you've used a spell, by trying to control it or to do something weird with it?<br/><br/>If not, how do you see this category coming into play?<br/><br/>I'm not totally sure.<br/><br/>5. Character advancement seems very relevant to this style of play. However, your ruleset is quite spare, and adding unnecessary bells and whistles to it seems like a shame.<br/><br/>I'd consider building in a system for "advancement" taking place as a way for the goblins to accumulate status and creature comforts. (Perhaps you age in the process, as well?)<br/><br/>Some kind of table or roll for getting a place to live, food, drink, servants, stuff like that? (Vincent Baker's "Freebooting Venus" has some fabulous rules for this kind of thing.)<br/><br/>When you reach the end of the character progression, your goblin becomes the new Boss, of course. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(And then the next adventure involves rescuing him, naturally!)<br/><br/>Alternatively, cool spells or weird natural goblin-like abilities (which would work similarly to spells) could be used, but that's less unique and flavourful, in my opinion. However, opening up room for weird goblin sorcery might also potentially close the gap I mentioned earlier, if it, indeed, exists.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>:<br/><br/>1. Thanks!<br/><br/>2. Yes, skip the roll should be more like "do this until you really need to roll"<br/><br/>3.  Players can go wild using armor but it:<br/>- Needs to be repaired and if you spend your turn in camp doing that, you're not clearing conditions.<br/>- Takes up torso space that could be spend on sweet cloaks, rope, and backpacks.<br/>- If you fail a roll to recover from injury or sickness, the result is a scar that takes up an inventory slot (so scarred greybeards aren't able to wear plate anymore.<br/><br/>4. Sorcery is intended to be just using known spells (from character creation, found in dungeons or bought in town) any goblin can use a spell.  It's intended that spells have unpredictable effects (suggestions on the sorcery page).  You get an extra die when you cast a spell, but you risk gaining a condition.  This keeps spells from being the solution to every problem, without imposing a uses-per-day limit.  It's cool to use spells, but it's worth it to risk a condition?<br/><br/>But maybe the limited list and limited usage is too restrictive. I’ll have to see how this goes in our next playtest.<br/><br/>5. Developing Goblin Town itself is definitely part of the system I’m hoping to flesh out. Could be a great part of advancement as a party. The other part of advancement is in character ‘experience’ that can be leveraged for an extra die. I’m hoping this can be more individualized more than other dungeon crawlers, like ‘killed a ghost’ or ‘made it out of the oubliette’ or ‘betrayed the dogmen’. The character gains an ‘experience’ each session, and the other players give them a new trait. I think this still needs more clarity.<br/><br/><br/>Thanks again for the notes!                        </div>

Sorcery is intended to be just using known spells (from character creation, found in dungeons or bought in town) any goblin can use a spell.  It's intended that spells have unpredictable effects (suggestions on the sorcery page).  You get an extra die when you cast a spell, but you risk gaining a condition.  This keeps spells from being the solution to every problem, without imposing a uses-per-day limit.  It's cool to use spells, but it's worth it to risk a condition?<br/></p></div></blockquote>
I see how Sorcery uses risks giving you a Condition, which is great (and very nicely implemented).<br/><br/>What I don't like is that this means using Sorcery should (?) always require a roll, which seems to go against the grain of the system in general. (What does failure mean, for example?)<br/><br/>I'm having trouble seeing how the Otherkind roll interacts with the specifics of each spell, in other words (especially the "sometimes..." clauses on each spell).<br/><br/>Your directions for "when rolling" also suggest that the GM should ask the player whether they want to use Sorcery. I'm finding it hard to imagine it being relevant to use any one of those spells in the middle of some risky action! That makes me wonder what you intend or envision here.<br/><br/><br/>About character advancement:<br/><br/>Personally, I'd prefer to see "experiences" being about things you've done or survived (as you mentioned earlier); if they double as a list of your accomplishments, that's pretty cool. <br/><br/>Something like having a list of them and being able to draw on one per level (or something similar) each session would work pretty well, since they would be specific enough that a longer list would be self-limiting.<br/><br/>But titles are interesting, too, I suppose!<br/><br/>I like the idea of having other players grant them to you. That's a neat bit of group-forging.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> <br/><br/>I'm strongly considering a more freeform sorcery:<br/> - Player describes intent.<br/> - GM comes up with dangers on the fly.<br/> - The sorcery roll determines if it's even possible and what consequences you face for trying.<br/><br/>I would worry that this would become the optimal play in all cases, and that you'd up in negotiations over what the plausible scope of sorcery is.  The upside is that it's dynamic.<br/><br/>I think the alternative is that you never roll for spells.  If you have a spell and in a position to cast it you:<br/>- Use your spell.<br/>- Mark a condition.<br/><br/>This feels like a much more constrained system, but also non-dynamic.<br/><br/>I think in the interest of finding balance between these approaches, I kind of missed hitting either.

Fixed that.  If a player is using sorcery, the GM tosses the player an extra die (and maybe says "Ooooh, sorcery").<br/>

That's my goal for titles, really.  They're a callback to past accomplishments.  Each session, the player says "This is what I accomplished" and the other players give you a title representing that.<br/><br/>It's not very scaled for frequency and amazingness of exploits.  It's one per session.  That said, titles that denote an amazing accomplishment are going to be easier to invoke (I think).<br/><br/>My goals for this XP were:<br/>- Brief handling time<br/>- Group forging<br/>- Qualitative (not numbers going up, or not primarily)<br/>- Zero GM control of XP<br/><br/>For a very different system, I figured titles would be:<br/>-cooler to say out loud<br/>-less of an overloaded term                        </div>

                            Yes, that's exactly the issue! It's an interesting one to consider. I'm not sure what the best solution is; I was really enjoying the way you wrote up the spells, as well, and it would be a shame to get rid of those.<br/><br/>I can see a few possibilities:<br/><br/>1. Sorcery and Rituals could be two entirely separate things. The Rituals (currently your spells) work reliably, as described, but there is also the option for some kind Goblin Sorcery, which is much more risky.<br/><br/>2. The success of Sorcery works differently from most actions (e.g. a 6 is required for success, or they require you to reroll one of your best dice, or you always suffer a Condition when you use them, you have a limited number of uses before something bad happens, they operate based on a resource you must use - like material components - or using Sorcery always results in a Scar).<br/><br/>3. Spells work as written (although you may wish to rewrite them somewhat with this in mind), but they bring the potential for risk with them. It's dealing with those risks that means you must roll with a Sorcery die: when you try to manipulate, extend, or change what the magic does.<br/><br/>(Into the Odd has a rule like this: a magical item does a certain thing reliably. However, if you want to use it for some unusual use, something it's not intended for, that's when you must make a roll and there is a danger. It's a nice way to signal to the players that this thing is flexible and interesting but also dangerous.)<br/><br/>4. Rewrite the spells as may broadly applicable, so that the goblins are likely to use them in risky situations.<br/><br/>For instance, instead of spells they could be demons or goblin spirits which are helpful in limited contexts - you can ask them for aid, effectively, on any roll where it's plausible that they could help you. You have a malicious goblin spirit on your shoulder that likes starting fires? You can ask it for help sometimes, and that may require a roll if it's something risky.<br/><br/> </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> <br/><br/>Thanks for the insight.  Here's my update to sorcery rules:<br/><br/><b>Sorcery:</b><br/>If a goblin knows a spell, they can use it at any time they meet the spell's condition.<br/>When they do, have them roll 1D6 to determine the sorcery result.  Sorcery is bad for your health!<br/>If the player wants to add a twist, and comes up with something compelling, they can add 1D6.<br/>Of course that means they'll have to resolve the twist, too.<br/>If a sorcerer is stuck on ideas for a twist, they could always use up their spell supplies!<br/>If they do, they might nit be able to cast it until they can camp and make more.                        </div>

                            Feedback : imagery<br/>Following the sorcery mechanic from table to supplies to task and dice I immediately picture a gagging goblin looking like Coyote after the dynamite went boom. <br/>Speaking of which, goblins could be made viler. Their skullduggery would inform the dice repartition decisions. A sacrifice from the player could be represented by some wickedness on the character's part, only for color, with the players collaborating. Maybe it's already in there and I failed to read it, though. Or maybe the game is more open to pvp take that than I thought.                        </div>

                            Thanks, <a href="/forums/profile/Aaron_Griffin">@Aaron_Griffin</a>!<br/><br/>Got a big playtest in of Goblin Town last night.  It was a hoot.  We have rules adjustments to make, but the feeling was just what we were hoping to hit.  There was a lot of enjoyment in playing through this mirror version of D&amp;D, where the humans barely tolerate our presence (even if we rescue them) and the goblin pirate horde might include some cousins.  We also got interesting, different characters right out of the gates and had a good time making eachother laugh with goblin antics, without losing momentum.  It's funny to be weird goblins on a mission, but we were still weird goblins <i>on a mission.</i><br/><br/>We had seven players and a GM (Goblin Master) running the AD&amp;D module <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Hunt_(module)" rel="nofollow">Treasure Hunt</a>.<br/><br/>Takeaways:<br/>- Character creation went great.  Most of us didn't know each other (I was a player) and we were asking each other interesting questions and tying together our goblin crew right from the start.  Giving each other traits and titles were a highlight.<br/>- We needed a simple turn system, especially for such a large group.  We hacked one together on the spot, but I'm going to formalize it.<br/>- We had some challenge with the partial success /  progress result.  I think it would help to have a rule for how it benefits you to act on the opportunity another goblin creates.<br/><br/>My biggest reflection is that the more interesting character creation stuff could be more central to play.  You have a job in Goblin Town and a boss that is missing/ kidnapped/ dead.  The GM is encouraged to tie these things to the adventure, but if you're adapting an old module, it might feel like an afterthought.  I think my next thought is: how to support the GM to be responsive to player-inserted hooks without them having to improvise everything?<br/><br/>My thought is to make a huge random table of jobs, employers, locations, dangers and twists.  The GM rolls once on each table.  These, and things like missing bosses and unpaid debts, are little adventure seeds around which the GM creates a premise.  Then the Goblins follow up on it.  This probably makes for short adventures, which is good, because they're getting back to town sooner to spend their coin and get into new trouble.  I'm imagining something more similar to the Blades in the Dark flow of play.                        </div>

                            So did your Goblins act wicked toward each other ?<br/>The flip-a-card loose turn order is nice if not abused. It ensures everyone goes, but the order is free. And a free order is always nice ;P                        </div>

                            Minimal intra-party wickedness.  They were too focused on getting a payday.<br/><br/>Here's the v1.0 of Goblin Town initiative:<br/><br/>Each player needs their own color of dice (4-6 each).  At the start of an adventure, players each roll one of their dice and place them in a line in the middle of the table, from highest to lowest.  If any players roll the same number, they have a tie-breaker roll.  This line of dice is the marching order.<br/><br/>Play then proceeds freely, with goblins describing their actions.  When a goblin attempts something risky, the GM (Goblin Master) calls for a roll.  When a player rolls, they take their die out of the marching order and use it to start their die pool.<br/><br/>If the goblins hesitate or disagree about a course of action, and it's unclear what is happening first, the GM asks the first player in marching order.  If the party collectively agrees on a course of action without one goblin in particular volunteering to take the lead, the GM confirms the course of action with the first goblin in marching order and then has that player roll.<br/><br/>A player can remove their goblin's die from the marching order at any time.  Maybe that player's goblin is injured and sick and doesn't want to strain themselves until they find a place to camp.  Maybe that player doesn't want the spotlight right now.<br/><br/>When all dice are taken from the marching order, a turn passes and the players roll initiative again.                        </div>

Thanks, that's just what I was going for.
<blockquote>Do you keep those dice on the table through the whole game, or just certain types of situations?</blockquote>
The whole game.  The last playtest, we brought it in during a fight, and I think that had the unintended consequence of emphasizing combat over the rest of the game.  Like, "now that daggers are out, we're getting serious" but that's not this game at all.
<blockquote>Do people ever want to swap the order around, instead of it always being random?</blockquote>
Ah, this I should make more clear: the goblins can still act in any order.  It's not a sequence-style initiative.  When you describe a risky action, you roll.  It doesn't matter if you're first in line or last.<br/><br/>The order only matters to the GM, so they don't ask the group "What do you do?" and then get four different answers.  Instead, you want to make a hard move and have someone get tackled by a ghoul, without asking everyone where <i>exactly</i> in the room they are.  So you look at who is first in marching order and the ghoul tackles them.<br/><br/>Or, perhaps more commonly, the group debates a course of action, agrees among themselves that they are climbing the cliff, then looks to see what happens.  Rather than having to ask "Who goes first?" and then watch as they check inventories and conditions, the GM can turn to the first goblin in marching order and describe to them the obstacle ahead.  If no one else jumps in, they are making the roll.<br/> </div>

                            The other thing I want out of a 'Marching Order' system is a cue for players to monitor their air time.  Sometimes in games like this, the chattiest person makes most of the rolls.  If someone wants to step back or wait until the spotlight is on them, they can.  But when your die is out of the queue, you can't take the lead again until everyone has had a chance, so it's a gentle reminder to build-up someone else's spotlight.                        </div>

                             I see! So, if someone doesn't want to be in the spotlight, they remove their die instead of moving it back in the order. <br/><br/> And you only look at the order of the dice when there isn't some other reason to go in a different order, or to focus on a specific character.  Only look at the dice when there is some uncertainty about that, in other words. <br/><br/> Seems like a smart spotlight apportioning system! I like how tactile it is.                         </div>

They can take the lead so long as they're still in the marching order.<br/>- When the GM isn't sure who's acting next, or who is most at risk in a situation, it's the first goblin in the marching order.                        </div>

Great idea!  A curse called "Stone Foot" you could make you have to go last.  A curse called "Necromancer's Eye" could make it that you're always the first one attacked.<br/> </div>

<blockquote>What does it typically look like when a monster makes a move</blockquote>
When a monster appears, it makes a move.  <br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/><b>Lizardmen</b><br/><i>Moves: Hiss, Hide, Ambush, Disarm<br/>Gear: Blowgun (1d2 uses), Spear, Poison Vial</i><br/><br/>They have 4 moves (so 4 'HP') but some of their moves have lower risk.<br/><br/>The goblins enter the swamp and the lizardmen ambush them with blowguns.<br/><br/>The first goblin in marching order (Blix) attempts to flee.<br/>Action: Get away.<br/>Danger: Poisoned (Sick)<br/>Risking Harm: Yes.<br/>Blix's plalyer introduces a twist.  The goblins might get lost in the swamp.<br/><br/>Blix rolls four dice and gets: 5,4,3,2.  Blix's player quickly assigns dice.<br/><br/>Action: 5 (Succeeds)<br/>Danger: 4 (Doesn't Happen)<br/>Harm: 3 (Condition)<br/>Twist: 2 (Happens)<br/><br/>Blix's player describes dodging the flying poison darts and fleeing into the swamp.  She marks exhausted.<br/><br/>The GM describes the new scene deep in the swamp and crosses out "Hiss" on the Lizardmen stat block, since the goblins succeeded on an action against them.                        </div>

Oh, I've got to clarify what I mean by a tie-breaker roll.  If you tie with another player, you reroll just against the player you tied with.  If two players roll a 2, they are after the 3 and before the 1, but a second roll will determine which of them goes first.<br/><br/>Since the marching order doesn't always matter (especially if the players are proactive about acting, rather than seeing what the GM throws at them) I'm hesistant to add any conversational handling time to it.<br/><br/>I might just have the person who acts last roll all the action dice and sort them quickly into order, for the sake of efficiency.                        </div>

                            I like the idea that you can't forget to take yourself out of marching order when you roll, because you need the die.  I also like that players can't just start building a die pool before they know what the roll is for.<br/><br/>But cards could be cool for a couple reasons.  No ties, which is nice.  Surprise initiative would be cool.  "A ghoul leaps from the shadows and tackles [flips card] Halfjaw!"  you could also use index cards and draw your own initiative marker.<br/><br/>I'll think on this one.                        </div>

                            I thought of the cards, too, but discarded the idea for the same reason you did (the double use of the die is a feature that's worth keeping).<br/><br/>As for combat with monsters... I feel this will need clarification in the text, at least for me.<br/><br/>Let me see if I understand it correctly, and you can tell me where I'm going wrong, if anywhere:<br/><br/>* When in combat with a monster, the GM describes the monster's action/move, but the resolution will wait until the dice are rolled (i.e. the goblin describes their reaction or takes action). <br/><br/>(I suppose there might be situations where the player will accept the danger without a roll, but I bet that's really rare, since usually we can just make the roll about something else, and include the danger in that resolution.)<br/><br/>So, the GM says something like "the minotaur is slicing down with its axe!", but we don't resolve that bit of fiction until the goblin has named their action in response and rolled for it.<br/><br/>* Defending yourself from an attack is not a valid stake in combat; you should always name some other goal or "risky action".<br/><br/>This is good (it's how this kind of system has to function to work, and moves the action/story along faster), but I can imagine people getting hung up on it or forgetting to do it. (e.g. "The minotaur tries to bash your skull in!" "I jump out of the way!" "Ok, but... wait! That's not enough. What do you want to get out of this?" "Uh, right. I guess I want to get out of its reach. How's that?")<br/><br/>* Sometimes categories will overlap, which is OK, and is one way you could get "killed" in one roll.<br/><br/>This is the part I'm less sure about.<br/><br/>Let's see if I have it right. Our goblin hero is facing off against a minotaur! The GM says that the minotaur slices with its axe ("<i>Slice</i> might injure the goblin").<br/><br/>First, the player should name an action or goal other than just avoiding the slice, as described above.<br/><br/>Then we have the following categories for the roll:<br/><br/>Action [the goblin's stated goal/action]<br/>Danger [this determines the success of the monster's move: in this case, the minotaur <i>injures</i> the goblin]<br/>Harm [the goblin could get hurt - including <i>injured</i>!]<br/><br/>The issue is the possible overlap between the three categories. First, I can see players new to the game forgetting to name a distinct action or goal for the goblin, which can make Action and Danger redundant (oops!). But, second, when the Danger is physical harm, then the Harm category can seem redundant, too.<br/><br/>Which die determines, for instance, whether the goblin got <i>sliced</i> or not? Or is it just up to the narrator, in resolution? Sometimes it will be important to know (e.g. there are monsters nearby who can track goblins by smelling their blood!). It doesn't seem like the Danger and Harm dice will always give us a clear answer.<br/><br/>Mechanically, this is also interesting:<br/><br/>Presumably, if both Danger and Harm dice are low, the goblin can be killed outright. (A double injury is death, if I understood the rules correctly, and each die has the potential to cause an Injury.)<br/><br/>It's not a huge problem, but can be tricky!<br/><br/>My takeaways are:<br/><br/>* Make sure the goblin names an Action that's not just about avoiding a monster's action.<br/><br/>* [possibly] Try to stick to monster moves that are not just about hurting the goblins - they should be things separate from (mechanical) harm, like chopping off limbs, capturing, knocking unconscious, pushing off a cliff, etc - so that Harm and Danger remain meaningfully distinct.<br/><br/>Is this correct? Am I missing something?<br/><br/>Has this ever come up as an issue in play?                        </div>

Totally!.  I added a note about how actions must be about accomplishing something, rather than preventing a possible consequence.
<blockquote>This is good (it's how this kind of system has to function to work, and moves the action/story along faster), but I can imagine people getting hung up on it or forgetting to do it. (e.g. "The minotaur tries to bash your skull in!" "I jump out of the way!" "Ok, but... wait! That's not enough. What do you want to get out of this?" "Uh, right. I guess I want to get out of its reach. How's that?")</blockquote>
There might be GM advice to make this smoother.  Like, you could (keeping it cinematic) say "You dodge out of the way, but the next blow comes just as fast.  What do you do.?"<br/><br/>Or even, a list of combat goals:<br/><br/>-Get out of their grasp<br/>-Tire them out<br/>-Injure them<br/>-Disarm them<br/>-Hold your ground<br/>-Flee<br/><br/>And so on. The perceived difficulty of these tasks would define the danger.
<blockquote>But, second, when the Danger is physical harm, then the Harm category can seem redundant, too.<br/><br/>Which die determines, for instance, whether the goblin got <i>sliced</i> or not? Or is it just up to the narrator, in resolution? Sometimes it will be important to know (e.g. there are monsters nearby who can track goblins by smelling their blood!). It doesn't seem like the Danger and Harm dice will always give us a clear answer.</blockquote>
I think Danger and Harm give a clear answer, but I needed to put how Harm works in the rules (not just on the sheet).  The Danger is always the thing the GM says: knocked over, thrown off a cliff, disarmed, injured, etc.  Sometimes it's a condition, but usually it's not.<br/><br/>Harm has three levels of resolution:<br/>6: Totally fine. No conditions gained (unless that was the danger, too).<br/>3-5: Condition.  The player chooses what condition to take.<br/>1-2: Injured.  The goblin is injured.<br/><br/>So if the danger is injury from a Minotaur's _Slice_, you're facing harm.  You roll a 2, 3, and 5.  If you're willing to fail your action (not get out of his reach), you can put a 5 in Danger (no injury) and 3 in Harm (Condition).  The Minotaur has you cornered and you start to panic.<br/><br/>The result of this in play has been players saying "I'm screwed" and then being kind of fine, usually.  Which is great fun.  Lots of broadcast danger and not a lot of instant death.
<blockquote>Presumably, if both Danger and Harm dice are low, the goblin can be killed outright. (A double injury is death, if I understood the rules correctly, and each die has the potential to cause an Injury.)</blockquote>
Yup!  It's worth avoiding fights.<br/><br/>Do any overlaps still feel 'off'?<br/> </div>

Yeah, I think the group action rules I should write is that you can roll for all goblins not separated or immobilized.  Harm is always personal.  Dangers can be personal or collective, as makes sense to the GM.<br/><br/>Also, yeah, twists are crucial to survival!                        </div>

                            The way Otherkind dice work is great - no problems there. <br/><br/>But I do think group actions should be cleared up (or you should explain the benefits of the lack of clarity, if you see some after playtesting), because it really isn't obvious in that example who's getting away, who's getting lost, and who's taking conditions.

I think Danger and Harm give a clear answer [...]<br/><br/>So if the danger is injury from a Minotaur's _Slice_, you're facing harm.  You roll a 2, 3, and 5.  If you're willing to fail your action (not get out of his reach), you can put a 5 in Danger (no injury) and 3 in Harm (Condition).  The Minotaur has you cornered and you start to panic.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>Do any overlaps still feel 'off'?<br/><br/><br/>Well, yes and no. I guess that, effectively, the choice of conditions here is what is determining whether the goblin actually got hit, right? In your example, the goblin chooses "panic", and interprets that as being scared but not hurt.<br/><br/>It's probably fine *most* of the time, but you can have weird outcomes like "the danger is avoided but you are injured" or "you're injured by the minotaur, but you don't take harm (as well)".<br/><br/>These are all possible to work out, but they are minor head-scratchers, and I wonder if that's ideal. <br/><br/>Maybe monster actions/moves should also be limited to things other than harm, to keep that category's utility? On the other hand, I like the effects of the "double miss" being a possible death blow...<br/><br/>(The sample combat actions look good, on the other hand!)                        </div>

                            I think you're right that it's worth accounting for and minimizing these weird outcomes.

                            Sorry to keep nit-picking, but I think you're interested in feedback to keep improving this thing (let me know if I'm wrong!):<br/><br/>1. The text about the monster moves makes sense to me, after our discussion here, but I don't think it's clear enough for a new/fresh reader. You could test this, of course! But that's my impression.<br/><br/>2. Something about "every time a goblin succeeds on an action, cross off a monster move" rubs me the wrong way.<br/><br/>Maybe it's that a terrified, unarmed goblin rolling dice to get away from the mighty minotaur... can kill the minotaur in the process. That's a little weird.<br/><br/>3. I think what happens with successes and conditions and dangers when a goblin is rolling for the whole group should be addressed somehow (even if it's just "GM decides").<br/><br/> </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> This feedback is great and very much appreciated.  Enjoying both the result ()the game procedures getting cleaner) and the process of identifying priorities and refining.<br/><br/>This draft feels the most like what I hoped for from this game, so any other suggestions to make it more clear or concise are appreciated.<br/><br/>1. Hm, I'll try to give it another pass.  And maybe a more visual example would help.<br/><br/>2. Here's a draft of the revisions I'm considering to monster harm:<br/>- When a goblin would inflict a condition on a monster (exhausted, panicked, injured, sick) cross out one of the Monster moves.<br/>- If the goblin is leveraging an advantage over the monster, cross out two moves.<br/>- If the goblin is attempting to gain an advantage, make the advantage concrete and tangible, but don't cross out a move.  Another goblin will have to follow up on it for the advantage to matter.<br/>- Sometimes, Goblins aren't in a position to injure or exhaust a monster.  Grappling unarmed isn't going to matter much to a Minotaur.  Make sure the stakes are clear before the roll, so everyone has a shared understanding of what an action might accomplish.<br/><br/>Monster moves could similarly be divided into how they:<br/>- Engage with monsters initially (threaten, ambush, or shamble toward).<br/>- Attempt to gain advantage (bash, grab, charge, paralyze)<br/>- Leverage advantage (drain, dismember, feed, liquefy)<br/><br/>3. Yup, I agree.  Here's a draft for group action resolution.<br/><br/>When an action is made for a group:<br/>- The action result determines whether the whole group succeeds.<br/>- The danger is something the whole group risks.<br/>- Harm only impacts the goblin taking the lead.<br/>- Players may introduce twists that effect all players, or just themselves.<br/><br/> </div>

                            Had a great playtest last night.  The big surprise this time was how fluid the otherkind resolution was for very different types of problems.  The players traversed difficult terrain, negotiated with lizardmen, and fought a giant spider.<br/><br/>The points of friction were both things on my radar that were not totally resolved:<br/>1. Distinguishing between danger and harm from monsters.<br/>2. Making progress / partial successes feel significant and transparent.<br/><br/>I think the two are somewhat related.  Progress is a partial success on an action (3-4 Die result), so it needs to give you part of what you want or improve your position.  We tried this in play, but 'positioning' was often amorphous enough that it was hard to feel like your action had accomplished something concrete.<br/><br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JF6eRom4YM_TcpQR9ZRDVcGMswhvJUw9/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Here's the play aid I came up with.</a><br/><br/>Based on this, this is how attacks could work:<br/>-When a goblin is in a good position (ambush, right weapon, etc) they can do 2 harm to a monster (crossing out two of its moves). A partial success still does 1 harm.<br/>- In a standard position, a goblin can do 1 harm.  A partial success puts you into a good position.<br/>- In a  bad position (knocked over, disarmed, dazed) you can only attempt to get out of the bad position.  Progress has no effect. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> <br/><br/>Similarly, positioning impacts the level of danger goblins face.<br/><br/>Normally, monsters moves <i>either</i> harm a goblin or present a danger of inflicting a specific condition.  Some monsters also have finishing moves with more dire effects, that they can only use when the goblins are in bad position (knocked over, disarmed, dazed). <br/> These finishing moves can inflict a condition <i>and</i> cause harm, or take a goblin out of the fight entirely.<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/><b>Great Spider</b><br/>Core Moves: <i> Flurry of bites (Destroy items and Harm), Leap (Gain position &amp; Harm), Climb (Gain Position)</i><br/>Finishing Moves: <i>Bind in Silk(Harm &amp; remove goblin from conflict), Venomous bite (Harm &amp; Make Sick)</i><br/><br/>In conflicts, players often wanted to choose between attacking directly or doing something that might create an advantage for another action, but there didn't seem like a meaningful way to do this without more explicit positioning systems.  This feels like a step in the right direction.                        </div>

                            I love the idea of the "finishing moves". Very slick! <br/><br/>As for the others stuff, I'll have to ponder.<br/><br/>MY approach has always been to simply cut those things out of the game. When I use Otherkind dice, there is no separate track for harm and danger, nor do I mess with partial progress, for exactly the reasons you outline.<br/><br/>But I encourage you to continue! If for no other reason than that I can do what I'm describing already - but you're doing something different, and if you can pull it off it's another option going forward.

                            Another idea (not necessarily a good one):<br/><br/>When your action might create an advantage for you or another, success means you get to carry forward two dice for that roll, so long as the advantage still exists. On a partial success, you still get one die (but maybe your advantage is fleeting or fragile).<br/><br/>That could replace your idea of fictional positions.                        </div>

I totally agree with you.  Players will think of interesting things to do in bad situations, and it doesn't add anything to stop them.  If a player goes for the spider's eyes even when it means death, that seems like a dramatic choice I want to encourage.<br/><br/>I think I'm going to keep the "no partial progress in a bad situation" and see how it plays.                        </div>

Yeah, that makes sense.  I think I should do some reframing around this in general.  The action that the goblin attempts in a conflict isn't necessarily an attack.  They might try to disarm a foe (if they're in a position to do so) or knock them off a ledge, or throw sand in their eyes.<br/><br/>The qualifier that you do 1 harm if you're in standard position and 2 harm in a good position assumes that your goal is to attack the monster.  If you swing your sword and succeed, I would imagine that damage is the intended effect.<br/><br/>In other words, I would assume whether the goblin is trying to inflict harm or create an opening would be clear <i>before</i> the roll.  But, if a player shifts their focus during resolution and decides that putting the party in a good position is more important, I think the rules should support that.

This is exactly the framing I intended to convey.  Will do.
<blockquote>Can multiple goblins add a twist? Can one goblin add 2+ twists?</blockquote>
Nope.  In each roll, there is only ever one action and one danger, and up to one harm and one twist.  I'll have to note that.
<blockquote>Sounds like multiple players might roll dice at the same time but I think it's just one player at any given time right? Or is it a group decision where to put the dice (e.g. for twists)?</blockquote>
Only one player is ever rolling at a time.  If another player wants to 'help', they can put their goblin at risk with a twist, adding to the acting player's roll.
<blockquote>In addition to this harm, they also inflict another effect: either a specific condition, or to take a goblin out of the fight entirely.<br/>How does this work? Is the other effect automatic? Dependent on the Harm die? Dependent on the Danger die?</blockquote>
The incapacitating effect is the danger.  A spider might wrap you in webs (the danger effect determines whether you're stuck) and bite you (the harm roll determines how serious this is).
<blockquote>Drinking grog lets the goblins skip camp without marking a condition. <br/>lets a goblin?</blockquote>
Correct!
<blockquote>Goblin Master - wondering if we can get away from "Master" terminology... "GM" is nice though... Goblin Mongerer?</blockquote>
Something to think about.  
<blockquote>Probably the emotion to cultivate to make these things important and interesting is <i>curiosity</i>, maybe note that.</blockquote>

                            I'm going through it and noticing some other things, so I'll keep commenting here.<br/><br/>It's excellent, first of all! Well written, and addresses the various issues and questions we brought earlier really thoroughly without needing to expend a lot of verbiage to do so. Nice!<br/><br/>1. "If an action resolves for the whole group, then Danger is also shared (all the goblins are lost, or they all drop an item from their hands). Harm is always individual, so only the lead has to mark a condition."<br/><br/>I'm curious why you specified this. I like the idea of all the goblins tumbling off a cliff, for example, and one being Injured, another Angry, and so forth... I can imagine some situations where just the lead goblin being affected makes sense (e.g. one steps forward to pull the lever, hoping to open the trap door) and others where everyone might be (trying to climb out of a pool of piranhas, tumbling down a cliff, stepping through a portal which has the potential to curse anyone passing through).<br/><br/><i>(On a total sidenote, and a potentially distracting one, I could also envision a mechanic where each goblin contributes a die to the main roll, and then the lead goblin has to give them each one die back after the roll, to place on the appropriate spot - whether Success, Danger, Harm, or whatever.)<br/><br/>(This could have some interesting flexibility. For instance, four goblins are trying to get through a big dungeon door before it slams shut, and there are monsters firing arrows at them from nearby. They hope to get through the door and to safety! Success here is clearly getting through the door, and everyone is helping. However, one goblin is carrying a valuable urn, another is using his mechanical arm to hold the door open for just a second longer, and the third is standing guard, hoping to block any incoming arrows. Each of the helping goblins gives one die to the "lead goblin", but each has a different concern: for the first helper, it's a Danger - will the urn break in the mad scramble?; for the second, it's that he could get his mechanical arm crushed and trapped in the door - a personal Twist; and for the third, he's clearly risking Harm from the arrows. The roll is made and the dice are returned, giving each goblin a personal stake and different possible outcomes. Heck, maybe one of the goblins is slow and fat, and so he must place his own Success die or end up trapped on the other side of the door...)</i><br/><br/>2. Position also seems to be written as shared by all goblins. But goblins roll separately in combat, so what happens if one goblin gets knocked over, and the others aren't? <br/><br/>3. Under "Monsters", you have an instance of the non-word "relevent".<br/><br/>4. "Every four turns, the goblins have to rest by making camp or they each have to mark a condition."<br/><br/>"Every four turns, the goblins need to make camp and rest."<br/><br/>Is it mandatory or not?<br/><br/>"During camp, each goblin must eat a ration or mark a condition. Drinking grog lets the goblins skip camp without marking a condition."<br/><br/>This is a little bit confusing. a) You need to Camp every four turns, or suffer a Condition. But! b) even if you camp, you need to eat a ration not to mark a Condition. Is that right? Then that first sentence should probably be, "every four turns, the goblins have to rest by making camp and eating a ration. If they do not, they each have to mark a Condition."<br/><br/>If the function of drinking grog is to skip making camp and eating, then it should probably be flagged somewhere other than deep <i>within</i> the "Camp" section (since it effecively supercedes it).<br/><br/>(Another idea is to have one of these factors influence the Camping roll, rather than being a requirement. e.g. Eating a ration gives you an extra die on your roll, or is necessary in order to Recover at all - otherwise you can only repair or forage.)<br/><br/>EDIT: I got to the summary at the end, which is super clear on this point. The main text is not, however!<br/><br/>5. Salvage/Fancy stuff/Gold, etc. is a really lovely simplification! Love it.<br/><br/>The monsters are lovely, too. I love the bats! Very cinematic.<br/><br/>6. "When using a spell, roll 1D6 and resolve the result on the sorcery table."<br/><br/>I don't think there is a Sorcery table!<br/><br/>(But also may not be necessary; the regular mechanics would handle things just fine, it seems to me. Although I did like the original table, which could give you a condition.)<br/><br/>(You could also say: when you use Sorcery, it is like risking Harm, except you can get Sick instead of Injured.)<br/><br/>The game looks lovely! I really want to play this sometime.<br/> </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> Thanks!  These are all great insights.  I'll have to go clear up all the procedurres around camp / rations/ grog.  I think the group actions could be reframed to be more flexible.  The sorcery table is the big one, it's unchanged (I like the risk of conditions, too) but it just got lost in the layout shuffle.  We'll have to find a place for it on the new character sheet.                        </div>

                            Perhaps it won't be useful at this point, but when I ran ghost/echoes, I found players accumulated too many partial successes, in such a way that many conflicts would last many rolls. My solution was to allow the GM to deactivate 3-4 results when he wants the conflict to reach an ending. When he does so, he announces it and for that roll, 1-3 are failures, 4-6 successes.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/moconnor">@moconnor</a> as GM, what would you do at this sequence of a fight, or would this sequence not happen for some reason I'm not seeing?<br/><br/>- Goblins are in neutral position and there's a stone spider over there.<br/>- GM chooses <b>climb</b> and narrates spider climbing to get into position (with intent to <b>leap</b> next if the goblins don't do something about it)<br/>- Goblins choose to run to the stalagmites, aiming for good position (it'll impale itself!)<br/>- GM chooses a valid Danger.<br/><br/>I'm having some trouble thinking of a satisfying Danger that affects all goblins and whose mechanical effect isn't just "goblins lose position".

Yeah, I found partial successes causing a lot of murkiness in Ghost/ Echoes.  Positioning makes the effects of partial successes hard and fast.  If you keep getting partial successes from standard position, you're not "doing damage" but you're getting into good position.  From a good position, partial successes still count as a success.  Fights have been fast, dynamic, and decisive.<br/> </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">@Guy Srinivasan</a>  I appreciate the specific example.  I think the guidance that applies here is: "If they figure out how to circumvent a danger, then they overcome the problem without a roll."  If the goblins have a clever approach that doesn't present an immediate danger, they just do it.<br/><br/>If I were running this, I would slide the position marker up to <i>Good</i> without saying anything, then turn to the first goblin in marching order and say: "The spider leaps down from the shadows just as you enter the dense field of stalagmites.  It's movements are hampered by the terrain but it's driving close. What do you do?"<br/><br/>I could ask the party more generally, but asking the first goblin puts the pressure on, emphasizing that the have a situation they <i>must</i> react to.  I'm making the "Leap" move without pinning one of the goblins.  When the goblin in acts, they'll be still be in a good position (so if they attack, the might be able to drive the spider off in a single action).                        </div>

I was worried about it, but shared positioning works surprisingly well.  It makes character actions in conflicts feel like they're connected.<br/><br/>An example from play: You're battling a sea monster.  The sea monster uses it's <i>Seize</i> to wrap a tentacle around Nobgins the Bone-biter (a goblin) and lift him off his feet.  His back is against the wall.  (A 1-3 on the Danger resolution puts the goblins in a bad position).  Geist, the Firebrand, Bearer of Great Stones, slashes at the tentacle with her sword.  But the goblins are still in a bad position.  Because the monster has Nobgins, there's more at risk in this situation.  The monster uses its Finishing Move: <i>Rend in two</i>.  Geist is risking harm herself, from the thrashing tentacles, and the danger is that Nobgins dies.                        </div>

                            Good answers!<br/><br/>I also never really saw the point behind the "partial success", and, in my own Otherkind-based games, I always just use success/failure (which is more than fine, since it's nuanced by the other factors which come true or false, as well). However, I can see how the roll improving your position makes this less of a problem under these rules. That's a nice touch!                        </div>

                            Nicely done! I really like the Sorcery rules, and that design post really helps explain how and why to use them.<br/><br/>One note:<br/><br/>I don't think it's going to be immediately apparent to everyone that the "BUT SOMETIMES..." column is basically a suggestion for Twists. I would make an explicit note of that somewhere in the Sorcery rules.<br/><br/>They're already odd in that there's no Action/Success category (or not always), so spelling out the details might be particularly helpful.                        </div>

<a href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">@Guy Srinivasan</a> These are so neat! I'd say you've got the method down.<br/><br/>I love "look just like an object" for the mimic.  I think "munch" could be more specific.  Devour limb maybe?<br/><br/>The positioning armor for the boar is really smart.<br/><br/>The magic ring is really neat!  I could see inscribing "courtesy" on the side, as a clue to how to use it (if it only works when you put it on someone else's hand).<br/><br/>I also like how many of the Wraith's moves don't create a danger for the goblins.  It basically would have to hang around until the goblins are in a bad position, then drain their life.  I would make the Spectres a little squishier, if the Wraith can keep calling in a new one.  Or, telegraph that this Wraith is a big deal and not to be messed with.<br/><br/>The sunlight special for Wraiths and Spectres is gold.                        </div>
