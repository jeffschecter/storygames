Specifically, Russia. They quickly conquer it.<br/>Russia is now Goblin Country. The goblins have adopted communist trappings, built weird machines that hybridize goblin magic and roughly WWII era Russian technology. (two reference points: <a href="http://www.planetaher.cz/images/Image/Tannhauser-Operation-Novgorod-figurky.jpg" rel="nofollow">Tannhauser: Operation Novgorod</a>, <a href="http://www.wargamersheadquarters.com/images/C/RedBlokcategory.jpg" rel="nofollow">Red Blok</a>).<br/><br/>So, here's how this works:<br/>There are magical force fields, possibly the dragons are their beacons, so you can't nuke or fly over Goblin Country.<br/>There are billions of goblins, so you can't just march troopers in there.<br/>There are dragons, so you can't just send in tanks or infantry-demolishers.<br/>Russia is really big, so there's lots of terrain to cover.<br/><br/>And yet:<br/>the US military wants to be doing recon work, probably looking for the shield generators.<br/>there might be survivors to rescue.<br/>we need to figure out how to eject these creatures from our world.<br/><br/>And we just realized that children, pure of heart, cannot be harmed by the goblins!<br/>In fact, if they close their eyes, the goblins can't even come within a certain range of them (meters equal to their Purity Rating).<br/>So, the US Military does the only logical thing. Trains pure-hearted children for recon work and dumps them in Goblin Country.<br/><br/>Okay, so...<br/>The kids get separated momentarily, while in Goblin Country.<br/>The goblins run up and kidnap Jacob (Lucy's boyfriend!).<br/>Jacob closes his eyes. The goblins don't go flying several meters back, because... ...Jacob isn't pure of heart any more!<br/><br/>So, the rest of the kids watch Jacob get dragged off, kicking and screaming.<br/>These kids are:<br/>Lucy (12 years old, was dating Jacob. Kissed him once.)<br/>Andreas (11 years old, madly in love with Lucy.)<br/>[no clue]<br/>[no clue]<br/><br/>The game is a hodge-podge mix of semi-tactical minis game, fairy tale story, and shortform adventure game (a la Blackbird).<br/>I need to know... who are those other kids?<br/>They all need hooks that make purity loss possible.<br/>The basic game is: Your friend is kidnapped. You're stuck in Goblin Country. Get out without losing your pure-heartedness. Oh, and failing to help people out will lose you pure-heartedness.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239491/#Comment_239491" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-28T13:00:58+00:00" title="October 28, 2009  1:00PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More of them communist contraptionist goblins: <a href="http://th01.deviantart.net/fs7/300W/i/2005/237/4/d/clokwerk_goblin_by_chief_orc.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.b2btrademart.com/pp/5057_058375f6.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
