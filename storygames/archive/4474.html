Yet, when I got it in the mail, the first thing that struck me was its un-indie-ness. Things like these:<br/><br/>- It's a large book, a 90's-style softback.<br/>- It has a GM. He or she has some GM secrets.<br/>- There are pre-written scenarios.<br/>- The system is combat-heavy.<br/>- The setting is about kicking monster (demon) ass.<br/><br/>Now, Dread is a very, very well-made game. Everything fits snugly, and is easy to use. A wonderful engine for fun action horror. So, you know, I like it a lot.<br/><br/>And it's its own thing. It sticks out in the current indie crop and is just... itself.<br/><br/>Yeah.

I'm really glad you like it. And thanks for taking the time to review the game.<br/><br/>Sometimes, I feel like the odd man out because Dread is pretty traditional. I am definitely an independent game developer, in that I own the game completely and I paid for all if it out of my own pocket, but I don't know if Dread fits the current definition of 'indie'. I don't pretend to understand GNS, but it seems that a lot of indie games these days are identified as Narrativist, whereas Dread has been pegged as pretty straightforward Simulationist fare.<br/><br/>However, as Jonathan pointed out, there are a few other independent games with similar characteristics. Which is cool.<br/><br/>As a gamer, I've played all kinds of indie games over the past five years. But as a designer, I always seem to gravitate towards more traditional concepts. Don't know why, exactly...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101255/#Comment_101255" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T09:15:25+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  9:15AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham W</cite>P.S.

It featured a desperate-looking man with a few bloody bullet holes in his torso. He was firing a gun at something off-camera, and behind him, the city was in ruins.<br/><br/>I asked a friend to help me create a cover using this image. He said he could do it for $25-$50 (friend prices, in exchange for a favor that I'd done him). Since he designed book covers for a living, I was sure that he'd put something nice together. I gave him a deadline of four months, and I expressed my gratitude. One week before the deadline, I found out that he hadn't even started working on the project yet. Ultimately, he delivered the cover art two months after the deadline we'd established, and he asked me to pay $400 for it.<br/><br/>Foolishly -- stupidly -- I had taken him at his word when he'd said that we didn't need a contract. Because we were friends.<br/><br/>I explained that his proposal was unacceptable, and he agreed to knock the price down to $185. He said that the project would have cost another client about $2400, but he was cutting me a deal because we were friends. He then sent an invoice for $200. I paid it and then asked him to make a couple of changes. Again, foolish mistake. Weeks later, he still hadn't made the changes. I decided that I wanted nothing more to do with him. I stopped interacting with him and discarded the work that he had done. A bitter lesson, but one that I apparently needed to learn.<br/><br/>At this point, I hooked up with a pair of graphic designers who call themselves Adwen Creative. They created three amazing covers for me to choose from. I was really into <a href="http://shop.fullpond.com/show/images/catalog/large/10_7106.jpg" rel="nofollow">Dexter</a> at the time, so I went with the one that had red blood splattered on a white background. It was pointed out that this bore a resemblance to the cover of the other game called Dread, published by the Impossible Dream. So I opted to use one of the other covers that Adwen Creative had designed -- a screaming face.<br/><br/>However, I'd paid for Adam Chowles' artwork, and I liked it, so I took matters into my own hands. I'm not an artist, but I really wanted a version of the Dread rulebook with that cover art.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Long, sordid story, I know. But that's why there are two covers to choose from.<br/><br/>Happy ending: Adwen Creative also took on the layout and some of the illustration of Dread, resulting in a book that looked a hell of a lot better than I had hoped for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101298/#Comment_101298" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T11:30:58+00:00" title="October  5, 2007 11:30AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>The angry shouty man cover is great.

I listened to a lot of metal while working on the game (Coalesce, Sepultura, Napalm Death, Slayer), and I briefly considered hiring someone to do a cover that resembled a death-metal album.
