I learned my rhetorical style from those college posters that do something like "Beer (or Boobs)! Now that I have your attention. . . .")<br/><br/>I was reading a thread on rpg.net about how some people consider art to be a waste of money and unnecessary in an RPG. I disagree with this. I don't know why I do. I think, "knowing what art does will help me when I decide how to put it into my game." I think, "I'd better ask people about this."<br/><br/>So here I am. What purpose does art serve in an RPG? When one is commissioning art for one's game, how does one decide what the art will be, where to put it, how much of it to have, how big, etc.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I'm not very interested in 'how much should I spend?" discussions. I'm more looking for a utilitarian take on this.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97588/#Comment_97588" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T14:15:58+00:00" title="September 19, 2007  2:15PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Art evokes a mood, compliments the text and can often help the layout and make rules easier to find as landmarks.<br/><br/>It inspires and drops ideas into the user's lap.

When I picked up and started flipping through Rifts: Atlantis, for example, the jaw-dropping Metzla illustrations by Newton Ewell really sold me on the concept. Frankly, a text description (accompanied by my attempt at a verbal description in-game) wouldn't really have done the concept justice. The images really drove the world (and its creatures) home. The same is true for most of the RPGs that I've really enjoyed.<br/><br/>As a designer, I rely on art to do the same thing for the people that buy my books. Just describing some of the angels in Malice wouldn't really get the point across, I'm afraid. The artwork takes text on a page and brings it to life. It helps to give context to the world that's been created.<br/><br/>When I commission artwork, I focus on large, full-page illustrations that get the attention of the players. I try to set it up so that the image is matched by the text on the following page, so as to augment and complement the material.<br/><br/>I try to focus on art that conveys the more impossible elements of the setting. Rather than show ordinary men and women, I hire artists to draw demons and angels and otherworldly situations. Personally, I'm only interested in that kind of material when I buy games -- after all, I know what a guy with a sword looks like. Unless the picture is just amazing, it's more effective to show something unreal or imaginary. In my estimation.<br/><br/>Some people consider art to be a waste of money. They probably won't like my games. Some people think that art adds to a game. They may or may not like my games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97592/#Comment_97592" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T14:18:33+00:00" title="September 19, 2007  2:18PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Beast Hunters, the tattoo art gives you a visual representation of The Prize.

Cool! That's what she wears; that's what her spears look like; that pouch is how she carries her pemmican and her chewing tobacco; that's how she wears her lineage scars and her captured feather trophies.<br/><br/>Illustrations can also give you a strong idea of what the climate looks like, what the buildings look like, and the urban planning.<br/><br/>For an excellent example of what I'm talking about, I'd suggest looking at <i>Artesia</i>. Smylie has a really solid grip on what his world looks and feels like; it helps that he's a talented professional illustrator, and it also helps that his entire rulebook uses illustrations from one unified voice. For another example, I'd suggest <i>Cadillacs and Dinosaurs</i> in this regard: without Mark Schultz' original comic, and the liberal use of his drawings in GDW's licensed game, would anyone really be able to <i>get</i> the vibe that's vital to this setting? Certainly not from the rather dusty GDW house-system rules...<br/><br/>Given these two examples, I'd say that, as a small-press publisher, one thing that you can do that will help your game <i>immensely</i> is, if at all possible, use art from only a small number of illustrators who you know <i>get</i> your game. One illustrator, if possible. I'd say a unified voice is much more important than having lots and lots of art, so if you have illos from only one person, you can get by with less (in which case, use them well): look at <i>Mortal Coil</i> for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97596/#Comment_97596" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T14:26:32+00:00" title="September 19, 2007  2:26PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            when i pick up an rpg book at a con or at a store (i never shop at stores anymore really) i'm not going to read your back cover blurb, in fact i've probably already read it online.

A few really high-quality pieces is, to my mind, much much better than out-of-context little eighth-page bitsies here and there used to shore up page layout.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97601/#Comment_97601" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T14:36:11+00:00" title="September 19, 2007  2:36PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One more comment, different from my points above.<br/><br/>I think art can serve two fundamental purposes in a game book -- as flavour, or as functional reference. Good games use both.<br/><br/>As an excellent example of the latter, I point to three games. <i>Artesia</i>, for some of the "homeland" description sections has little thumbnail sketches of what denizens from that land look like. This is quite useful.<br/><br/>But my favourite use of functional art comes from the <i>James Bond RPG</i> and from some old <i>Call Of Cthulhu</i> supplements: for adventures with NPCs, or lists of NPCs, these games often used little "headshot" thumbnails so you could see what he face of the character looked like. I thought this was an <i>awesome</i> use of functional reference illustration. It helped add spice to an otherwise dull page design (list of stuff) and it really helped you fix the NPCs in your mind as the referee.<br/><br/>One thing I am <i>not</i> keen on in this arena is yet another stylized bunch of weaponry illustration. Unless these weapons are somehow culturally placed in a world background and different to what we have in our own world, I really don't see much point at all behind this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97604/#Comment_97604" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T14:39:40+00:00" title="September 19, 2007  2:39PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am in the 'art is a waste of time and money' boat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97611/#Comment_97611" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T14:56:08+00:00" title="September 19, 2007  2:56PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Functional reference, yes.

It's hard to put into words, but it can be really inspiring.  if the game actually helps you create something of that feeling in play, all the better.  <br/>--Art can give a little window into the setting of the game.  Every fantasy RPG seems to have a picture of [typical PC group] in the market square of [typical fantasy city], but some really give a distinct flavor to the setting, show you how all those setting elements come together.  <br/>--Art can portray memorable characters that give people ideas -- the "I want to play <i>this </i>guy" effect Judd mentioned.  This effect is heightened if the memorable character is in a memorable situation -- want to find out what happens next?  Play and find out!  <br/><br/>Here are a few covers that stand out in my mind as doing at least two of those things: Sorcerer, Dogs in the Vineyard, The Mountain Witch.  The last one is subtle, because I think it's a PC's-eye-view of the Witch's fortress, suggesting the dread and uncertainty that should be felt at that point.  <br/><br/>(Covers don't need to have art, I'm just referring to them because I'm not at home and can't refer to internal artwork by page.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97636/#Comment_97636" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T16:22:25+00:00" title="September 19, 2007  4:22PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Man, that question is depressing.

Some people respond to visuals, some don't. Those who don't, probably don't give a shit either way if there's art in the book or not, but those who do, could very well overlook or even be instinctively turned off by a book of pure text. At the meanest level, the addition of artwork is a marketing tactic, and that's where you should start thinking about it. Is it worth me saving some money now to lose potential sales in the future? All the other stuff, about making a beautiful product, conveying the feel of the game, etc. come afterwards.<br/><br/>Of course, this is coming from an illustrator, but one who hates to think of artwork in terms of sales, so while I'm a bit conflicted about what I've just said, I think it's the cold truth for an author of game books.

In the case of Jorune, it's darn close to being necessary for the game to exist at all, IMO. That's on the unsubtle side.<br/><br/>But one thing that comes to my mind when thinking about what a game book should look like, is that the art tells the reader something about the author's aesthetic, and something about their intention for the game. To take a concrete example, the style of art that Fred Hicks selected for DRYH tells you something about what he intends that game to be. Maybe something that can't be put into words, or not easily. Whether that something will come out in play, I don't really know. But it's there. I would certainly buy a game without art in it. But if it has art, it's one of the first things I would look at as a guide to what the author is thinking (and, even more, feeling).<br/><br/>Then again, many books appear to have a hodge-podge of whatever the publisher could find at bargain rates.

Argh.</blockquote>\nSo well put. I couldn't agree more. Along this line would there be a thread?: "How useful are words in a game?". I'm not trying to be inflammatory. <br/><br/>Art is a language of communication just like text. It's not quite the same kind of communication but that's why together they can be more powerful/ evocative/ communicative than either alone. It's another tool for showing your audience: "This is what I'm getting at! Isn't it awesome!"<br/><br/>Just like poor writing, "bad" or inappropriate art will put me right off too.<br/><br/>Another thing to consider, as is illustrated by the various opinions in this thread, is that people can respond differently to the same information. So from a marketing perspective you might want to include art just to try to appeal to a broader audience, for example a more "visual" gamer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97653/#Comment_97653" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T17:59:44+00:00" title="September 19, 2007  5:59PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 19, 2007 5:59PM by shreyas.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Here's one that I think is important:</p>\n<p>A picture can't be valued in words.

I can explain all that in words and examples, but I think it needs some parallel reinforcement.  But it's historical, right?  And reasonably well documented.  I can use photographs, and some of them are free!  Well, I could, but that sends the wrong message.  You aren't playing a documentary, you are going to diverge quite a lot from history and that is OK.  Art can evoke at a remove, I guess - I get to honor the ground truth but still make it my own (or, in this case, Jeff Bent's own, which is even better).  And I also get to tailor the images to enforce a particular pedagogy - they are sequential and follow the examples of play in the book.

I totally agree with the point that art in an RPG must be carefully chosen to be consistent in its vision and what it is telling the reader about the world of the game they are looking at. Sadly that can be hard to do when you struggle to get enough art at all for your book. (For Solipsist, for example, some art is done by me, some by Gregor, and some by a friend of my wife, and with the best will in the world our work does not look the same).<br/><br/>Cover art is even more vital I think, to getting people to buy in the first place, even when its simple. Its like a series of hooks to get you into the game. First the title (and to a lesser extent the main colour of the spine and cover), then the cover art, then (maybe) the blurb on the back, and finally the first few pages and the internal art. All of the internal art is vital in the last stage, of course, because so many people will flick randomly through a book once they have decided to pick it up. <br/><br/>I know I do this with novels. The title gets me first, because I can see it on the spine. Then I pick up the book and look at the cover, and often put it down again if I don't like the look. After that the next port of call is the blurb, and if I like *that* its on to the flicking <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>This is quite apart from what everyone has said about the use of internal art for both atmosphere and factual reference.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: viktor_haag</cite>One thing I am<i>not</i>keen on in this arena is yet another stylized bunch of weaponry illustration. Unless these weapons are somehow culturally placed in a world background and different to what we have in our own world, I really don't see much point at all behind this.</blockquote>\nI would agree that generic illustrations of generic weapons that everyone has seen before don't do much, but sometimes the weapons are as an integral and unique part of the setting as the monsters or the styles of dress and need to be illustrated as such. Dark Sun was a good example of that, you really needed to know what all its bizzare weapons looked like to capture their feel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97765/#Comment_97765" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T07:19:20+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  7:19AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob,<br/><br/>Yes.

If the cover suggests something interesting (RIFTS) or is just eye-catching (Mu, third Edition L5R), it is more likely to accomplish this.  This does not demand anythign specific, and indeed, the cues change over time.  When D&amp;D 3.0 came out, the hyper-stylized book covers excited and interested me, and a number of the variations they've done have similarly caught my eye, but as they genericized it, it became much less compelling.  I have yet to resist pulling a nWOD core hardcover down from the shelf because I love their covers.  Now, this is not the only reason I'll pull a book from the shelf - I'm usually already looking for something - but it can definitely play in.<br/><br/>More powerfully, I pull a book down, flip it open, and see what jumps out at me.  That initial impression comes from the layout of the book, which includes the artwork, albeit in specific ways.  If the layout is very boring, I'm going to automatically assume the book is going to be a chore to read, and a clean layout, nice headers and margin-art and appropriate use of color can all offset that.  Sooner or later I'll hit a piece of art, and its impact is going to be determined by it's _purpose_.  If it's a diagram, I'll zoom in on the rule it's illustrating, because it's caught my interest.  If it's a crappy piece of art, I'll start flipping through the book to see if that's typical.  If it's a good piece of art, I'll check the nearby text to see if it speaks to the game being that cool, but even if it does not, it's caught my attention and made me think "Neat, can I be _that_ guy?"  Most often, if it's enh, I flip past it and forget about it.<br/><br/>At this point, I am most sensitive to a bait and switch.  If the artwork and appearance of the book tell me one thing, specifically something reinforced by the blurb, I will be upset if the game then does something different.  This can be true even in a game with phenomenal artwork, and I'm going to point a finger at Mortal Coil here, because my love for it is both deep and obvious.  Jennifer Rodger's art is fantastic, but is also very dark. It is eye catching, since the color contrasts with the rest of the book, and if I were to _just_ look at the art, I would expect a moody horror game rather than what is in actuality a fantastic but reasonably generic engine (and that said, the cover is much closer to the actual game).  Thankfully, both art and content really rocked, so I was not actually upset, but that kind of disconnect can be a real problem.<br/><br/>After I've Bought The Game<br/>It goes on a bookshelf, and I'll faintly remember that I have it, but unless I intend to run it, there's a decent chance it gets set aside.  At that point, the game will benefit from a mnemonic hook, so when I'm considering what to run next, it makes the list.  A visual impression is not necessary for this, but it helps, especially depending upon exactly how visually a person thinks.<br/><br/>Eventually, I will decide that maybe I want to run it, at which point I will pitch it to my friends.  Art can be a useful tool to me at this point, if I can show someone a picture and say *this* is the game I'm going to run.  Again, I don't need it, but it's a handy tool.  Similarly, depending upon how visual the friend is, art may be more or less central to the pitch.<br/><br/>Once I Begin Play<br/>Yeah, art's a page reference.  Sometimes it's a utility - Character illustrations in a strongly inter-personal game for example can be of some use. The headshots from old Vampire and the Trumps in the Amber DRPG are great examples of this. In a crunchier game, maps, diagrams and illustrations can also be useful, but ultimately those needs tend to be very game-specific.  Mostly if I'm hitting the book at this point, it's for reference, and I care less.<br/><br/>The one exception to this is that if the book has some nice visual style I can emulate in my handouts, that's a big plus, but I recognize that as a deeply specialized need. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Bottom Line <br/>I join the chorus - a game book should be well designed, and art is a tool of design, but like any other tool, there are ways to accomplish good design with any amount of it, from virtually none all the way up to a game presented entirely in graphic novel form.  There are books that I have potent internal visual images of (Nobilis, PTA, Burning Wheel) which I would be hard pressed to remember any of the interior art, and games that I have left by the wayside but whose art still sticks with me (Rifts, 7th Sea) because those games used their art assets to good effect.  Art is powerful, but without design, there's no telling if that power is going to work for or against you.<br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>PS - I do not object to painted illustrations for covers, but for every one that I find genuinely striking (Rifts, Thirty, Grimm) there are literally dozens that are such painful Elmore wannabees as to hurt my mind.  That said, illustration can make for a great cover, but there are more artistic styles out there than just oil painting that are well worth looking at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97832/#Comment_97832" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T10:18:22+00:00" title="September 20, 2007 10:18AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, something JD and I agree on! I'm vaguely in the art is unimportant camp, but I'll explicate more. <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, art definitely can sell books. But I'm really ambivalent on this matter. Yeah, it means I'll probably put it in my books purely because I have a goal to move books and get people playing my games. But I wish I didn't have to do so. Largely I feel I have to in order to make the book have a chance to be picked up and looked at. Because of threats like Kevin makes above. <br/>\n<br/>\nWorse, while art can often be evocative of what a game is about, just as often I find that it is, in fact, deceptive. Or, rather, there is no way to know if the written material will stand up to the art. There's no correlation. For instance, Rafael mentions the Metzla illos in Rifts: Atlantis. I agree, they're stunning. Which makes it only that much more dissappointing that the material behind it is Rifts. Here's where I will cop to actually having succumbed to the art and have actually bought this particular supplement, because of the art. My rationale was the typical gamer rationale... "I'll use it for inspiration in some other RPG." Have I ever? No. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not so much that I lament having spent the money. But that I actually feel bad that there's this visual image in my head of what these things are like, a cool image, and I've never found a way to get it into actual play of any game. Why is that? Well, because I've got about a million other such images in there, and I invent new ones as needed. Basically there's a massive surplus of such ideas. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat there isn't, is a description of the Metzla culture that makes it meritable as an inclusion into play of an actual game. They're a "monster" race, and so are given the typical D&amp;D-level treatment that such get. In this particular case, in fact, I recall that their culture actually makes no sense at all. It's just not useable material in the book, unless I'm running a hack-n-slash Rifts game. Which I'm not. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the art has sold me something that I cannot use. Even when I knew better. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for art evoking a mood... generally I don't need this. I find that I can introduce mood myself just fine, and that I'd prefer the mechanics to be of help here. The art isn't going to make it into actual play often. Heck, I often don't carry the book of the game I intend to play. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, where art does provide a shortcut to communicating an idea, I'm all for it. Art can surpass words in many cases. For instance, a picture of a monster is much better than reading the text, to get across what that monster is like in terms of it's appearance. I would rather use a picture for something like that. That said, if the game statistics don't match the picture, I'll be irate. As an example, playing WOW, I'm sick to death of the picture of the creature in the game giving little to no data that's useful in gaguing it's actual power level. Oh, sure, a Trog that's larger than another will tend to be more powerful than the last. But this is only a tendency. Even size isn't a garuntee of power. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this is just rudimentary stuff. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, sure, if your art is "accurate" in terms of getting ideas across to your players, I'm for it. But if it's not, then I'd rather have no art than misleading art. I give my favorite example of this from an old Rolemaster adventure for Shadow World entitled Vale of the Cyclops. The cyclops in question is somewhat unique in that it's not a giant with a single eye. The text describes the cyclops in question, Rarg, as being a giant who has had both eyes gouged out, and who has a mediallion with a big gem in it or somesuch that serves magically as an eye. <br/>\n<br/>\nPretty nifty. There's even a good picture of him on the cover. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut then, in the text, there's a Paul Jaquays picture with Paul's typical flair, under which is a caption, "Rarg." But then the picture has Rarg with one eye, center of head, no amulet. This is an art typo. <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically I find that art is so often used to "advertise" that I despise it in RPGs. By "advertise" here I mean "lie to get you to buy in." The product doesn't live up to the claim made by the art. And that pisses me off. <br/>\n<br/>\nGraphic design, per se, is another deal. Aligning text, art, and other design elements in order to make a text more readable is a thoroughly laudable goal. If, in fact, art is being used to somehow accomplish this, that's great. But, again, I tend to find art to be used distractingly, rather than in a way that makes the text flow better. <br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe we're just not particularly good at art in RPGs. But I think that it's fraught with such problems that I'm generally against art. Sure, where done well, and used well, it's probably a great tool. I'm just afraid that this is rarely the case. <br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, I've never missed art, where it's absent. In Jared's original InSpectres folio, the lack of any art, except for the corporate logo on the cover (if that can be called art), was perfect. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet's contemplate this... why do novels not have art? I mean, if art is so important in evoking mood and such, then why don't we see art in every single novel ever written? I'd posit that a narrative format, like both novels and RPGs, do not need art. Sure, an occasionall illustration or diagram where words would be difficult, sure. But more than that seems to me to be either distracting, or sheer advertising. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow about this... if the thousand words that the picture is saying, are ones that you wouldn't write in tbe book? ... don't include the picture. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn gaming, I think the best handling of art that I've ever seen, has to be from Games Workshop. These guys know real art, and real graphic design, and, most importantly, you play the art. That picture of an Ghazkull the Ork Chieftain in the book? Looks the same as the miniature, and the system has rules for exactly what effect all of his gear has on play. The fact that he has a power claw on the fig and in the pic reminds you that he gets the special rules for power claws. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's effective. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not saying it can't be done well. Just that it's much, much harder than people think, I believe. And that, if you're not certain you can incorporate art well, then less is much, much, much more. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97836/#Comment_97836" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T10:29:35+00:00" title="September 20, 2007 10:29AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, Mike, but entirely not what I'm looking for in this thread.

I am surrounded by advertising essentially from the moment I wake up until the moment I go to sleep, so saying something has a marketing function (deceptive or no) is essentially the same as saying it is a consumer product. This seems to be an intentionally and enforcedly art-positive thread, I don't think it would be decorous to derail too much, so I just kicked in a little bit earlier. If we want to carry on the discussion about art conflicting with text, we can take it elsewhere.

I think the notion that art is separate from, say, text is problematic. <br/><br/>For example, suppose I take Jonathan's recent post and change it thusly: \n<blockquote>BACK COVER TEXT can also promise things your game can't deliver.<br/><br/>When that happens players are often disappointed.</blockquote>\nI have good reason to believe many people here can read that and nod sagely that, yes, they've been suckered by back cover text before, damn it!<br/><br/>So, art is <i>information</i>. It comes in a slightly different medium than text, for example. But, I have a hard time seeing how it can't fall into the same problems and benefit from the same successes that text does. Good text and good game design help the game. Bad text hurts it. Good art can help the game. Bad art hurts. And so on. <br/><br/>The problem here is setting up art as something so distinct and special that it becomes expendable (which Mike, maybe, and Alexander definitely would advocate). Anything in a game text is expendable if it does a bad job of whatever it is the game text sets out to do. <br/><br/>I advocate a more holistic approach that sizes up whether art has a place in the product, what purpose is serves (and how well it does so), just like I would do so for, say, back cover text, the right font, whether to include sidebars, or including Color text (fiction, character vignettes, etc.).<br/><br/>I am not saying a game product equires art, by the way. I'm saying it's much more useful to look at all of the potential pieces of information to convey to a reader/user/player and figure out whether those things have a place. If art has a place, great (it often does)! If not, fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97954/#Comment_97954" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T14:56:01+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  2:56PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me, saying that art isn't part of a game when it is in the text is like saying that your posture and non-verbal cues aren't important when you speak.<br/><br/>I hope that isn't one of those terrible parallels that I hate.<br/><br/>There's an evocative power that is really important and ideas that get across that are key.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97957/#Comment_97957" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T15:00:56+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  3:00PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt_Snyder</cite>I advocate a more holistic approach that sizes up whether art has a place in the product, what purpose is serves (and how well it does so), just like I would do so for, say, back cover text, the right font, whether to include sidebars, or including Color text (fiction, character vignettes, etc.).</blockquote>\nFair enough. The thing is I can't do visual art (at least, I lack the training and maybe there's some hidden talent I'm unaware of that can get past my terrible manual dexterity). I can do words so I know pretty well how to use them. So I don't mean to break up the gestalt of art and text, but merely to admit what I'm not adept at and get an idea what the art I will commission needs to be doing in my book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97958/#Comment_97958" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T15:01:43+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  3:01PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>To me, saying that art isn't part of a game when it is in the text is like saying that your posture and non-verbal cues aren't important when you speak.</blockquote>\nI get where they're coming from.

What should one expect to pay? Is this something feasible for someone who is publishing his first game?<br/><br/>Art director is someone other than the artist if the artist can't draw. Keith Senkowski can illustrate his own products; he doesn't need art direction, really. Me? I can't illustrate. So, I direct artists instead. Sometimes the direction is very broad -- "Give me some gritty Western stuff." Sometimes, the direction is very specific -- "Ok, I need you to draw the guy with his arms outspread, and place these symbols on each corner of the picture. Here is my crappy sketch for you to work from."<br/><br/>The only instances I know of in our hobby where someone paid for art direction were those where someone hires someone else to do layout for their book. I've done quite a lot of that, though less in the last year or two. It's a lot of work for little pay, frankly. I've been paid anywhere from $100 to $600+ for layout work, within which I'd include some art direction.<br/><br/> In nearly all of those instances, art was already decided and I had little input on its creation. But, I did get to decide how to use the images in relation to the text. The better I understand the text, but likelier I am to coordinate images and words ably and coherently. This isn't always perfect, but when it works it's great! Much better than with just words alone, I think.<br/><br/>Other people have more input. When I work on my own books -- Nine Worlds for example -- I'm fully in charge of art direction. I very specifically directed all pieces of art in Nine Worlds. I'm extrermely pleased with the result. <br/><br/>Finally, yes, I think this is feasible for someone working on their first game. It might be more difficult, particularly if that person has never directed any kind of publication or design of any kind. But, feasible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97999/#Comment_97999" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T17:18:17+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  5:18PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah so you're saying essentially "be your own art director?"<br/><br/>In a way that's what this thread is about.

Especially if you're only going to have one artist, it's not going to be that big a deal unless you feel you have no firm understanding of what is and what isn't good art. Even if you do feel like your level of taste is refined enough to spot weakness, I would highly recommend having someone else around to give you a second opinion on the work, preferably an artist. Honestly, I think the hardest part of art direction is keeping the artists aware of deadlines and knowing which battles to fight so you don't bog things down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98005/#Comment_98005" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T17:46:20+00:00" title="September 20, 2007  5:46PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WHOOPS! Would edit that first contradictory sentence from: <br/>Art director is someone other than the artist if the artist can't draw.<br/><br/>To:<br/>Art director is someone other than the artist if the *art director* can't draw what he/she needs (or doesn't have time for).<br/><br/>Now, as to your recent question, Robert. Yes, being your own art director has considerable advantages of time and costs, and more importantly avoids any miscommunication between creator (say, the writer) and the art director because the vision is in one person's head. But, it's not something every single person can do. I know, having done a layout for Alexander, that he is unable to do his own art direction. Literally cannot do it. That's ok. Other people -- say, Matt Wilson -- can do it. If you can, do it! The advantages are great. But, if it's your first time, ask someone for advice, or to review your product when it's in some stage near completion. <br/><br/>Teaching you how to direct art is a pretty long topic. And, teaching it (rather than doing it) is probably something I don't do well. I get frustrated and just say things like "Go with your gut on how a pic looks" or something similarly useless to someone who doesn't know what the hell I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Here's one concrete tip I'll share that I think is very useful. When you request/direct art from an illustrator, I find extremely useful to a game product to get artwork that has situational dynamism. That is, it isn't posed bad-assness (see: Brom). It is actual stuff going on that makes you think and learn about what the game is about. Don't see illustrations of a posing babarian chick bad ass. Get one of her standing in front of a cowering man as she stares down three thugs. Pictures that say something is going on are best. Pictures that just put something cool on the page are, for me, less useful. There are some good examples of that in Sorcerer -- look at those pics carefully. Dust Devils also has pics like that -- there's a picture of gun, which is fine. But, there are names on the bullets which is AWESOME. There are lots of other examples in texts, good and bad.<br/><br/>The shorter way to think of this advice is: Get "action" shots where something is happening, rather than posed shots where there really is no action.<br/><br/>What uses do I think art has? Many. Here are a few that pop into my brain off-hand.<br/><br/>* Marketing. <br/>* Re-inforcing Color ("atmosphere" or whatever you want to call it). <br/>* Creating mental bookmarks in a text so people know where to turn ("Oh! Character creation is on the page with the big ass sword! Just flip to it!").<br/>* Showing, rather than telling situation ("See? The guy with the dagger under the table! THAT'S what I'm talking about! Awesome."<br/>* Making references to other media cleverly so people begin to associate things in their minds with your product. It's not just marketing and cool by association, it's also inspiration! ("Oh! I get it! You mean like Firefly! I'm totally going to make a smuggler now.")<br/><br/>Oh!

If, in fact, one fixes the problem in question by making the text match the art, that's a fine solution to me. But the fact is that this is not a typical design process for whatever reason. Usually the text is written already, and the art is brought in after the fact to add value to the product (or just as advertisement). If/when that's your process, then make the art match the text. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your process is reversed, if you're designing from the art primarily, then, yeah, you have to ensure that your text matches your art. Can anyone give me an example where that was the design methodology used? I'd be fascinated to hear of such a case. <br/>\n<br/>\nRob, sorry if this is a tangent, but consider it my rebuttal to what some people claim that art does do for games. Like Alex agrees with me, art is usually not part of the game, and can, at best, inspire a certain sort of play (instead of directly instructing on how to achieve it). That's not to say that this is the only role that art should have, but how things typically are. An excellent counterexample are the cards in Everway, where the art is, in fact, directly influential on the outcome of play. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo art can take on this role. It's simply very rare, and in it's infancy. Which doesn't mean that one should not do it, but, rather, just puts it in perspective. If you want to use art as part of the game directly, you have only the one example that I can think of to refer to in developing something new. And if you decide not to make the art a direct part of the game somehow, I'm suggesting that art really has very few potent positive roles in RPGs. Matt has suggested the only one that I buy into, which is using art as a graphical element as part of a layout design that actually makes the reader better able to absorb the text. <br/>\n<br/>\nI know you're hoping for something positive, but my answer to the question of what art can do is... typically not much. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99457/#Comment_99457" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T07:49:44+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  7:49AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite><br/>I know you're hoping for something positive, but my answer to the question of what art can do is... typically not much.</blockquote>\nRight, I understand that, but that point has been made several times and continuing a debate is really not what the thread is for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins" title="Russell_Collins"><img alt="Russell_Collins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.clockworkaudio.net/images/russfacesmall.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Russell_Collins">Russell_Collins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99727/#Comment_99727" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-28T08:52:26+00:00" title="September 28, 2007  8:52AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to mention that I have often felt that some designers work visually; from pictures or film clips in their imagination of the places, characters, and events in the game. Many of the incongruous and ridiculous monster races I've seen probably sprang from a doodle or an imagined picture, followed by an attempt to create stats and biology, as well as monster society that explain why the rust monster has a propeller on his tail. <br/><br/>In these cases, the art is actually a design tool. You can share this imagery with your players in the same way you would write about your game inspirations.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not thinking much about this stuff when I'm designing Contract Work. Sadly, I watch movies about Hitmen but when I write it, it's more of a cerebral exercise than an artistic. Little visual vignettes don't spring to mind unless I'm trying to write some fiction to inject into the game, and maybe art will spring from those. <br/><br/>The other project, that fcuking bit me on the ass, has my head full of pictures like someone set off explosives in a video game factory. I've already asked an artist who does high quality pixel art to fill the damn book with Street Fighter style characters, leaping around and striking their "I rule!" poses next to their dossiers. Tangentially, I actually don't want to be writing GOD OF BULLETS! right now (I have CW to finish!) but I get excited every time I type the name. In fact, I can feel  my pulse has shot up now that I'm thinking about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99940/#Comment_99940" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-29T10:17:56+00:00" title="September 29, 2007 10:17AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Russell Collins</cite>I'd like to mention that I have often felt that some designers work visually; from pictures or film clips in their imagination of the places, characters, and events in the game.
