They might want to be sneaky fighters, they might want to be beautiful princesses. Expect more focus on social than martial victories - let them roll dice to see who can persuade, manipulate or control an NPC at some point, for example.

One of the basic D&amp;D clones like Labyrinth Lord, maybe.

I dunno.  It seems that a lot of the women responding here are saying that either they played games like D&amp;D as a child or they wanted to and couldn't.  And if I was a father, I would think it was totally awesome if my daughter wanted to slaughter orcs instead of playing "a proper game for girls."

I don't care if my girls want to play <i>The Princess Game</i> or straight up <i>DnD</i>.  However, I do want to minimize the violence, or at least the graphic or murderous aspects.  Non-fatal comic-bookish violence would be OK.  My girls love superheroes, princesses, talking animals, and faeries.  They're going to be drawn toward those interests.  If there was a <i>My Little Pony</i> game, guess what?  That's what they'd pick.<br/><br/>When they're older, they might become more interested in grit and grime and so forth.  But right now, that's just not where they are.  My 8-year old's eyes glaze over at the mention of <i>DnD</i> (though she likes the monster art).  <i>Faery's Tale,</i> though, grabs her attention.  I'm not being prescriptive about what other 8-year olds would want, but I have little to no agenda about gender appropriateness in games (although admittedly, I'd lose SAN if we were to play <i>My Little Pony</i>).  Where it would likely come up might be more me steering her away from, say, a Barbie Princess kind of game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190567/#Comment_190567" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T13:37:48+00:00" title="January 29, 2009  1:37PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i mean, the only issue with the "pick from a pile" thing is...<br/>like, what if they like the setting and don't like the mechanics?<br/>i mean, everyone can sit down and "get" 3:16. it's awesome that way. <br/>(same with best friends, incidentally) but there are other games which provide more of a curve,<br/>either take more set up or have crunchier rules.<br/><br/>like, for example, if i were 10, i'd go right for mouse guard. as johnzo said (at the table, after i picked <br/>a pre-gen pictured with a sword over one pictured with a staff) "yeah, you signed on for a mouse with the sword.<br/>that's why you're here, pick that one." but we didn't ever really get to the part i wanted to get to,<br/>where i'm like jumping off something huge and sticking something with my sword. or...<br/>i guess my argument (long and rambling as it is) is simply: <br/>sometimes picking a game based on what you hope it will be like doesn't work out,<br/>and if i didn't really know much about games, then i'd be daunted and confused by something <br/>complicated that seemed straightforward. <br/><br/>that being said, i'd play Mouse Guard with Best Friends &amp; kids. that would be excellent.<br/>(of course, mouse guard is great- it's not the game for me, and nor, i daresay, for most kids 8-12.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190569/#Comment_190569" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T13:53:36+00:00" title="January 29, 2009  1:53PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Candy Creeps!

I don't think the system matters so much as the subject. At the moment, the 'Twilight' book series, is huge with the 10-14 year-old-crowd, especially girls. Thus, anything involving vampires is likely to be a hit with anyone who's read the books.  In other words, find some setting the children want to play in and then go from there.  IMO, that's a much easier task than trying to guess which RPG will work for your particular group.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the after-school RPG club I run, 4E is a big hit with the students (all but one who are 13-17 year old boys) because it plays a lot like WoW and that's something most of them are in to.*   My experiences with my 6-year-old son have followed along these same lines. I started trying to play Faery's Tale with him but he didn't really like the premise. So we moved on to Marvel Super Heroes, with him playing Spider-Man because we've read a few of the comics together. That he could totally identify and get in to. Fast-forward a couple of months: We're now listening the the Spiderwick Chronicles audio books and suddenly he wants to play Faery's Tale.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n* In retrospect I wish I had gone with Red Box D&amp;D (I almost did but decided on 4E because I wanted a chance to run the system) because many of the students really don't engage with the actual system very much and thus combat encounters tend often tend towards the mundane. The one exception is the youngest kid in the group (14) who's read the rules and plays his rogue to take full advantage of his movement and sneak attack abilities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

At 13 we started to mix it up with Gamma World, and Star Frontiers. Seriously many of them are likely playing World of Warcraft nowadays, so maybe the 3.5 World of Warcraft stuff. Also the Secret of Gingerbread Men, by Annie Rush. Perhaps Toon. <br/><br/>I've had personal success with someone around nine (who was male) with Mortal Coil. We ended up in a game where our characters were kids who got lost in the woods behind the school and discovered our secret shape changing powers. He seemed to love having parity with adults with creation of the fiction.<br/><br/>I think Mickey, that you might want to also consider techniques you think will be helpful, more so than trying to pitch the perfect games. For instance if the kids are playing with adults having parity in creating the fiction is likely to be pretty damn grabby for kids regardless of the game or their sex. If playing by themselves a clear ruleset is going to be good. Also I think adults underestimate kids capacity a lot and that might be worthy of discussion also. I know a lot of us here figured out something as complex as D+D as kids in the age range you are discussing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190733/#Comment_190733" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-31T09:59:01+00:00" title="January 31, 2009  9:59AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Amen to underestimating.

I like Trollbabe, but the drawings are problematic.  As is the art in, say, Exalted.  <br/><br/>I'm always open for more discussion or suggestion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191567/#Comment_191567" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-08T13:27:24+00:00" title="February  8, 2009  1:27PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the easiest answer is just to set up a situation where, whatever the system, you have girls playing interesting female protagonists, and that may be something more readily accomplished on the real-world people level than the game mechanical level.<br/><br/>I'd been working on a game mashup with an eye towards running for my daughter and her female pals[ or better yet, giving it to her and having her run it for her friends]). It was based off a cross between Meg Bakers' <i>Young Ladies of Quality </i>and <i>Space 1889,</i> that I called <i>The Class Trip of 1889</i>. Mechanics aside, the core idea was to have the main characters be all super-talented girls from Miss Schiffer's Academyrs, but with each player also having talented ( but less well-rounded) non- Academy Girl characters on the side ( along the lines of Ars Magica multiple characters/troupe play).<br/><br/>I never did complete it, but the core idea was there: female characters are at the core of this game, and that's the focus that always comes back.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
