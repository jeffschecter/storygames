I played it as a kid for a while and then turned my back on it.  I never found it all that fun and, importantly, it didn't make much sense to me.  If I became interested in a D&amp;D setting, I played it using another rules-set altogether.   I played 3e a few years ago but the DM threw out the majority of the rules so I never got much experience with the actual system with him.  I had other DMs eventually (damn, it's weird typing "DM" but it actually applies here) and, frankly, the rules-fest, rules-referencing feeling of full-bore 3/3.5e was fairly craptacular.<br/><br/>D&amp;D 4e is very encounter based as a means of progressing characters and these encounters are entirely battle-map based.  You will be fighting an uphill struggle if you don't use a battle-mat or some other grid map to show spacing.  Seriously, it wil be very difficult to coherently describe the scene given the amount of information that needs to flow between participants.<br/><br/>All that tactical play, however, results from the large amount of powers and abilities that characters and their opponents can bring to bear on the battlefield.  The rules are explained *very well* and the encounter mini-game replicates a fast-moving, board-game and minis experience.  If you're looking for that, this game delivers.  It's fun to play and fun to run; I wasn't house-ruling anything and playing with every rule presented and it still ran pretty quickly given our brief read-through of the rules and nascent experience with 4e.  Play was dynamic with many options for both players and DMs to take; also, the old-fashioned "sit back and wait for your turn" style of play has been abolished; game play is very back and forth as you can interrupt other turns for a variety of reasons (powers, combat options, etc.)<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to improvising an encounter at our next 4e try-out to see how easy or how hard it is; improvising is my default style of play -- I don't have encounters planned usually -- but the clearly presented rules and the excellence of the core book Monster Manual write-ups would seem to lend itself to putting an encounter together on the fly.<br/><br/>I'm also looking forward to running a skill challenge which, as it reads, is part Duel of Wits from Burning Wheel, part Extended Contests from HeroQuest, part Bringing Down the Pain from Shadow of Yesterday.  Skill challenges in combat are even trickier but any D&amp;D rules system that let's you use bluff skill while fighting in order to get a combat advantage is a big plus in my opinion.  <br/><br/>Reports that 4e is very close to being a story game are hogwash -- 4e's default premise is kill things and take their stuff and game mechanics in between encounters supports no particular style of game  -- but I can see that 4e hasn't been designed in a vacuum.   Then again, all that talk about 4e being a video game is nonsense as well.  4e characters are more kick-ass, their powers more dynamic and battles more fantasy-gonzo-exciting than 3e.   As long as the folks involved with playing the game (either as PCs or as a DM) are imaginative and want to tell a participant-inclusive story, there's no inherent video game here.<br/><br/>Is it my favorite fantasy rpg system ever?  Nah. Did I want it to be? I couldn't really care. I'm not trying to validate D&amp;D in any way and I have no agenda to resurrect my childhood gaming experiences.  I think a lot of people trying to find the ultimate system will judge it according to absolutes.  I won't be giving up Heroquest or Fate 3 or Adventure, etc., to play 4e exclusively. If, however, you're looking for a game that has sandbox-style roleplay punctuated by a high-power tactical encounter mini-game, it seems as though this game will pop for you.  If you're looking for In a Wicked Age with more strategy, move on.  One thing is for certain -- if "fun" is defined by exciting and coherent game play, 4e is funner than any previous edition of that venerable beast called Dungeons &amp; Dragons.<br/><br/>Part 2 next week.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147780/#Comment_147780" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T17:13:52+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  5:13PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>"Reports that 4e is very close to being a story game are hogwash." </b><br/><br/>Is someone actually saying that?

I'm just not seeing it.<br/><br/>4e delivers a core D&amp;D experience without a lot of the bullshit that stunk up earlier editions. In other words, you can do 4e with almost no prep, without memorizing many huge tomes. I handed character sheets to a bunch of folks, some of whom hadn't played D&amp;D since 1st edition, and they picked up the rules without a lot of hassle and played their characters effectively and had fun. That was much harder to do with 3e, and even harder in 2e.\n<blockquote>The focus that 4e has on encounters is even more significant than prior editions since so many powers are based upon that as are the accrual of action points.

But you said that a) "D&amp;D 4e is very encounter based as a means of progressing characters."<br/><br/>I don't think this is any different than previous editions <i>as a means of progressing characters</i>. To earn XP in any edition of D&amp;D, you had to succeed in an encounter. Earlier editions had loosey-goosey rules that told the DM to give out very small XP rewards (100-200 XP) for good role-playing. I think 3e said you could earn XP for overcoming an obstacle without killing it, but it was still an encounter. 4e goes further than any prior edition in making the idea of quests that could have nothing to do with combat encounters part of the core advancement rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147822/#Comment_147822" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T20:12:35+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  8:12PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's how I interpret the enthusiasm from this community that I've seen:<br/><br/>NOT: "We, a bunch of "Story" gamers, who, as a community have tend to have a lot of members who often enjoy play in a narrative style, think the new edition of D&amp;D supports that style.<br/><br/>BUT: "We, as a community (especially the design component?), think the new edition of D&amp;D is really focused, finally, on what it does well.

They say things about it that they consider negative which I consider positive.  D&amp;D4E is going to be a system shock for a lot of people who have never reflected much on the whys and hows of their gaming.  For example, people are shitting bricks over the minions rules.  Many can't conceive of the idea that a given monster might not be important and that you may not want to spend a lot of time dealing with it in the game and <i>that can have an impact on the mechanics related to that monsters</i> (shock! gasp!).  Instead they say it "makes no sense" and that "an ogre shouldn't be killed by stubbing it's toe" (minions have 1 HP regardless of what the monster is).<br/><br/>The best move the D&amp;D4E designers made was getting rid of the ideas that the rules provide an absolute frame of reference for the abilities, characteristics and capabilities of everything in the possible game world.  Now if a given monster doesn't matter in an encounter with the player characters other than as a mook, it's a minion with 1 hp.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to many more "it makes no sense" comments from current 3.5 players who can't wrap their brains around mechanics designed to produce results rather than to represent characteristics.  Every "it makes no sense" comment I read warms my heart that D&amp;D is finally focusing on its strengths.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_147872">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147872/#Comment_147872" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T00:24:54+00:00" title="June  4, 2008 12:24AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice writing, Denys!

(I didn't want to start a new thread).<br/><br/>I just unraveled one of the reasons I dug the new D&amp;D:<br/><br/>I love cinematic combat. In games where combat is abstract, this gives me the freedom to narrate some crazy-ass Blade II style whoopass. Feng Shui does this well, but I apply it to a lot of my games. If I ran a game of Wuthering Heights, Heathcliff would have been raised by Shaolin monks, and Catherine would have known Dim Mak.<br/><br/>So, in games with no real tabletop frame or maps needed, I can generally get by. However, with some 3E campaigns I was running or played in, it didn't feel nearly as awesome as more cinematic games (and most likely, this recursively goes back to 2e as well). It came down to the fact that it did not matter if I described my actions awesomely, or just said "I swing", the tactics in the game came down to little more than putting my fighter right in front of another dude, and swinging over and over until they fell down.<br/><br/>Now, there's so many more options for individual characters, options available to parties (people setting each other up for tactical advantages), and maneuvers on the board that are available (because of the action-move-instant action system, shifting, etc), that *I don't care about the cinematic as much*. <br/><br/>I'll have to think about this more after 1-2 more sessions, but I think the addition of rules-based stuff keeps my tactical mind so engaged, that I don't need to have backflips and kung fu all the time anymore. <br/><br/>Anyway, just a thought.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148188/#Comment_148188" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T16:31:55+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  4:31PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: markwalt</cite><cite>Posted By: Denys</cite>You will be fighting an uphill struggle if you don't use a battle-mat or some other grid map to show spacing.

I feel like the options, and how they're limited by At-Will, Encounter, Daily, also BEG to be descriptively narrated.  My instinct is that the new set up lends itself very well to describing some cool cinematics, moreso than previous editions.

One thing I'm glad is gone is the atmosphere of needing to clear everything with the invisible player first before it became credible in the game.

ALL classes, wizards included, have at-will, encounter, and daily powers. Wizards add some cantrips and rituals. But in general, you can use lots more powers. For example, you can have Magic Missile as your at-will power and use it all day long, then do Burning Hands once per encounter, and Sleep once per day.\n<blockquote>Are low-level characters as impaired as they were in 3.5?

I recall GURPS and HERO (Hero moreso) having strong mini-support, but I can't say whether they use them <i>well</i>.  But I think you're right in that D&amp;D, at least in games still in print, is probably the most mini focused, and by a wide margin the best at it (ignoring hybrid tactical games like Battlestations, which usually come with minis or at least counters to use).<br/><br/>But when you look at the market share of somewhere between and 70-85% for D&amp;D (and d20), you really only need the one doing it. And while I haven't been looking at the mini market, it's my understanding that WotC has been building up their mini support since 3.5 with their own line, and there's a lot of options out there (most notably, many minis now that no longer need to be painted!)  I just don't think it's really a problem.  I think your point raises a good issue, especially with seeing some posts about how 4E is much more beginner friendly. Is that how much will minis and maps raise the bar for new players to get into it ("You mean I have to buy $120 in books, and another $40-100 on a basic collection of miniatures?")  I hope that the core books have some options like "You can use dice, coins, action figures, or potato chips as counters for your characters and monsters" that many of us vets often use by second nature.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148429/#Comment_148429" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T13:34:54+00:00" title="June  5, 2008  1:34PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Minis were hardly unique to 3E.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll movement rates in 1E and 2E were given in inches...normal human movement was 9", 6" for dwarves.

Who provides the miniatures?  How much tolerance is their for proxying (say, a guy with an axe for a guy with a sword)?  What size is each square (some people do all their dungeon crawl gaming on 1 square = 1 cm).  What about the use of counters rather than miniatures?<br/><br/>As for D&amp;D4e, you have two different groups of adventures you need to consider.  The published ones and possible homebrew ones.  So far the published ones come with the maps/grids you need and fit on a reasonable sized kitchen table.  If people are making up their own, who can say whether they'll fit or not?  I think it'd be completely unreasonable to expect the D&amp;D4e rules to somehow accommodate every possible map layout and square size people might use.

And done my share of playtesting of both miniatures games and hex based historical games.  Including games ranging from a hard core historical conflict simulation grind to very results oriented designs (in the same way we might talk about various modes of play in RPGs).  Ofcourse system matters when it comes to miniatures.  But a lot of the points that you brought up are about tolerances for deviation from perfect representation.  It's a common thing in miniatures gaming.  Some gamers always insist that everything be painted and that <i>every single piece</i> of gear a given character might have should be perfectly represented on the miniature.  Others are fine with an unpainted guy with a sword and shield even if their character wields an axe.  And then you have people who actually prefer an incorrect representation.  <br><br>These issues have been discussed to death in miniature gaming circles (do a search on theminiaturespage.com's message boards for some of these topics) and unlike the discussions about RPG mechanics mattering and the types of decision making they produce, <i>a lot of these issues don't produce different results as far as game play is concerned.</i>  You can make arguments about aesthetics and practicality, but you'll get the whole spectrum.  Some people have no problem setting up a 20 foot by 8 foot table every few weeks and playing a monster game.  Others play in smaller scales on 2x2 boards.  Other people take the scale of a given rules set and reduce the scale by 65%, use 10 mm tall miniatures instead of 28mm and then convert inches into centimetres so they can fit a huge game into a small space.  <i>Nothing about this changes the actual game play.  Nothing about it changes the decision making process in game play</i>.  The vast majority of miniature wargames assume that people are playing on surfaces larger than their kitchen table.<br/><br/>As to who provides the miniatures, once again you have a huge spectrum.  If I'm trying to convince people in my gaming group to get into a new game, I'll often paint up and provide two small forces so I can get them playing without requiring them to do work first.  Other times I play in games someone else provides all the miniatures for.  One of the local stores has been tossing any common and uncommon that doesn't sell over a certain amount of time in a box that can be used for store sponsored gaming events.  Putting something like "the GM is responsible for providing all the miniatures for the monsters" in the rules would be daft.  It would be the same as other games insisting the GM brings the dice and not the players.<br/><br/>Sorry if you didn't like my earlier response or this one, but your questions seemed to be coming from a place of little or no experience with miniature wargaming.  I hope this expanded answer is more satisfying and shows that I didn't mean "matter of individual gaming group dynamic" in the same way as opponents of system matters who say that game experience depends entirely on the GM/Players and not the rules.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148642/#Comment_148642" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T16:04:39+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  4:04PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Sorry if you didn't like my earlier response or this one, but your questions seemed to be coming from a place of little or no experience with miniature wargaming."<br/><br/><br/>I have a ton of experience with minis, which led to those questions being asked.<br/><br/>My point was that very few RPGs ever approach those issues at all, even when they theoretically have rules for minis.<br/><br/>Which to me, means no support or no effective support.<br/><br/>If there's a game that says it's all about drama and conflict of a social sort between player-characters, you'd probably expect some kind of procedure to set that up (certainly around indie circles anyway) and encourage it.

Your original questions did come across as being similar to asking "why doesn't the player handbook tell me who has to buy the dice?!".  I think only the points about how miniatures are placed, removed, moved, etc., are actually relevant whereas the rest are to be addressed outside of the scope of the rules (property issues, space, practicality, aesthetics, etc.,).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148650/#Comment_148650" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T16:44:29+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  4:44PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, part of the stuff you see around the indie scene is specifically asking how those things do impact play.<br/><br/>I think things like aesthetics, and space, and pracrticality, and property issues are actually very much wrapped up in using minis for gaming, and are unexamined where rpgs are concerned.<br/><br/>With straight minis gaming/competitive minis gaming, there are some sort of standardized answers that have developed. Most successsfully, the Games Workshop school of thought, which essentially says that each player must buy what they plan to use ( assuming they're getting in for the long haul and not just dipping a toe into the hobby). Similarly, CCGs largely assume ( and discuss) card ciollection ownership.<br/><br/>RPGs? Don't even really discuss any of that. Nor do they tend to give practical advice on how the minis ownership interacts with character creation ( Do you make the character first, then find a mini or in the reverse order? Which one you choose has some rules implications and astehtetetetetic- (oh, however you spell "taste" when you're gioing upscale) implications.)<br/><br/>How much space you have, and how you use it has enormous implications for pacing and adventure design, even when just discussing site-based adventures.<br/><br/>Whatever. I'm way off track. I'm not looking for methods from you specifically ( no matter how practical they were). I'm looking for <b>design</b> that takes them in to account, in the context of an RPG. I mean, A LARP is still aLARP, even if you set around a kitchen table the entire time*, right?<br/><br/>I mean, it could be, I guess. But it doesn't really play to the strengths of the medium, nor avoid the weaknesses.<br/><br/>Bluntly, I can usually tell that minis use hasn't been supported by the fact that it's one of the first ideas that RPers tend to jettison from a game, even 4e. I'm hard pressed to guess the number of posts I've seen over time asking how one can do without minis or battlemats or whatever. That doesn't tend, IME, to be a sign that folks have had a positive experience with minis use in their rpgs**.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>* Yes, I did try something like this once.<br/>** OTOH, I started cooking up ideas for using minis with Universalis upon discovering it. Uni may be one of the least likely candidates for minis use ever invented.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148655/#Comment_148655" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T17:09:21+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  5:09PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This discussion has triggered my curiosity regarding games that are minis games first, RPGs second, which I propose to pursue in this thread: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6705" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6705</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen" title="M Eryesen"><img alt="M Eryesen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen">M Eryesen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148675/#Comment_148675" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T19:31:09+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  7:31PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            komradebob, I want to take this opportunity to apologize for the inappropriate tone and assumptions I made in my post.  I should have made a greater effort to understand what you were getting at.  Your last post did it for me.  I actually disagree with nothing.  I would only add that while certain things like <br/>aesthetics, and space, and pracrticality, and property issues can impact play, they aren't really something that can be codified in a rules set in any meaningful way.  For example, a rules set using miniatures might say you have to use only the miniatures they produce, they have to painted with paints that company makes and the GM has to provide them for all players.  But that becomes functionally meaningless as soon as it hits the players.  People are not going to go "oh, looks like we can't use my miniatures, Joe, you have to buy them.  Or I guess I have to run the game.  Oh wait, I used artist ink in a wash on this one, not their branded ink.  I guess I can't run it either."  Even GW can only rule out other maker's miniatures in their own stores and sanctioned events.<br/><br/>I just think there are areas a given rules set might try to give rules for that it has no business doing.

I'll be a tough customer to impress, though, which I suspect is true for many of the people posting here as well.<br/><br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>I didn't see your questions answered, so...<br/><br/><cite>Posted By: markwalt</cite>Is the magic system any different?  That is, do you still "memorize" spells and then forget them when they're cast, or have they adopted a new paradigm for spellcasting?</blockquote>\nMagic is very different. ALL classes, wizards included, have at-will, encounter, and daily powers. Wizards add some cantrips and rituals. But in general, you can use lots more powers. For example, you can have Magic Missile as your at-will power and use it all day long, then do Burning Hands once per encounter, and Sleep once per day.\n<blockquote>Are low-level characters as impaired as they were in 3.5?  My biggest complaint with old D&amp;D was in being weak as a kitten at first, and then overpowered and godlike later on.</blockquote>\nAbsolutely not. We kicked a dragon's ass with second-level characters. You start out being a badass, and it only gets better from there.\n<blockquote>How about hit points and wounds?  Any significant changes here?  (This area is my second biggest complaint)</blockquote>\nYes, you have many more when you start (warlocks, for example, have 12 plus ability score, so about 25 or so. Then they gain 5 or 6 per level, I don't quite remember now. Plus you can heal 1/4 of your HP per battle, and you've got several of those healing surges per day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148776/#Comment_148776" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-07T18:19:04+00:00" title="June  7, 2008  6:19PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran my first 4th ed. game today.  The black dragon, though young, apparently brought more pain than the two level 1 characters could handle, but given that they went down from his "bloodied breath" power that activates when he reaches half his health, that alone says something about where the frailty of first-level characters has gone, eh?<br/><br/>But frankly, by that part, we'd gotten a little tired.  The skill challenges early on--first to find their way out of the forest they got lost in, and then to ford a fast-running river--really shined.
