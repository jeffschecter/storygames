Thanks for the write up.  I'm gonna port your questions/comments here to answer them.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>I think some more limitations on cross-class talents are in order... in this game, the player of the longrunner urged everyone to take 'Do two things at once (if one is running)', which made them an unstoppable parade of destruction. Maybe like niche protection: you can't have a cross-class talent if someone in the party already has it?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I have a question for you about this one, Mike.  What level were the characters?</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Maybe add another combat action: 'Cunning plan: use your gear, the terrain, etc to gain some advantage in the combat. E.g. "I use my specialist equipment: bombs to turn the terrain into hazardous!"' Really, I just want a placeholder (and suggested mechanic maybe) for 'something else not directly about damage/movement/awesome tokens'. At the moment, there can be a temptation to just stick to the listed combat actions, because they are listed as 'the things you can do'. Adding one that encourages creative crazy tactics (as seen in both my games so far) would be cool.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Crazy tactics?  Planting bombs?  That's totally a Showing Off action to me.  How is what you're looking for different from Showing Off / Assisting?</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>I don't think you need all that stuff about connections between arenas, beyond a little paragraph about how they might be one-way or ranged only or require a roll or something. Categorizing them as you have doesn't seem to add much.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>You're probably right.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Some of the talents are way, way more effective than others. Is that a choice or are you still balancing them. Of particular note: the longrunner's two things at once if one is running (do anything then move) compared to warrior's charger (move then get an attack).</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I'm groovy with some talents being more or less effective than others.  Just so long as every single talent is effective and fun.  Not-fun or not-effective talents have to go.</p>\n<p>Further, if all my players conspired to take the same talent, because they thought that it was the UberTalent, I'd start by raising an eyebrow as high as it could go as ask "Really?  Are you sure you want to cripple your party by not having any other abilities?"</p>\n<p>Then, if they insisted, I'd go right on to create monsters that could more easily counter that single tactic.  Like FAST + FLIGHT.  "You guys really are fast and dangerous.  Too bad no one took a flying fox, because this wyvern can really blast through the air above you.  Did I mention that 'The Air Above You' is a seperate arena?  Yeahhhh..."</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Note for Eric: do you intend that there is no real way to boost up your defense to get away from a really mean attack? The players were concerned (mainly when I one-shotted their warrior who was sitting on 15 or so awesome tokens, I think) that they had no defensive option in that case. There's something in that, but I had a feeling that this might be intentional on your part... can you let me know which it is?</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>You're right.  That's totally intentional.  It's mostly a whiff-prevention device.  The best defense in RBH is to kill your enemy before they can kill you.</p>\n<p>I would have <em>laughed my ass off</em> at the dude playing that warrior.  "So, the dragon wasn't all that impressed with your pelvic-thrusts, eh?  Guess you should have <em>attacked</em> or something."</p>\n<p>Good stuff, Mike.  I'm eager to hear what level those characters were.  It'll inform my opinion on putting in more niche protection.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120978/#Comment_120978" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T11:19:26+00:00" title="January 21, 2008 11:19AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2008 11:20AM by Mike_Sands.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric Provost</cite>I have a question for you about this one, Mike.

I was thinking about maybe tactics that might change the arenas, possibly prevent movement between arenas, that sort of thing. Not simply something that converts into an attack bonus, but effects the tactical setup in other ways. Unless you would prefer that sort of thing only be allowed by talents?\n<blockquote><p>I would have laughed my ass off at the dude playing that warrior. </p></blockquote>\nThat was, indeed, my reaction to the situation.<br/><br/>I can totally see where you are coming from with the whole 'no defense from awesome' thing.

I don't go into explicit details of it in the rules, but I've always imagined that the arenas and their connections are just as volitile as the narration allows them to be.  If someone locks a door, that could kill a connection.  If someone blows up a bridge, that could kill a connection too.  Might even kill off an entire arena, if the bridge were it's own arena.</p>\n<p>I recall a recent playtest where one character climed a tree, and declared the top of that tree to be it's own arena.  So I had the big monster come into the Forest Arena that the Tree Arena was contained in, and had that monster try to knock down the tree.  I made a Size roll of some sort of the monster.  IIRC, I failed the roll for the monster.  But if I hadn't, I would have erased the Tree Arena from the board and moved the PC's miniature into the Forest Arena.</p>\n<p>I encourage you and your groups to be just as creative with your arenas and connections.  I would offer you this rule of thumb:  Re-draw the arenas and connections as often as necessary, without the assumption that they are stagnant and unchanging during combat.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Re: all going for particular talents...</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Well, I'm not sure what to tell you here.  All I can really say is that I would have politely discouraged all the players from taking the same talent.  But, at the same time, I want the option to be available.  I mean, if they think that power is kewl, just imagine if they'd all taken Homonucleus?  Being able to take two different actions in two different arenas is way more powerful than just a free movement action.  Combine <em>that one</em> with a free-action talent and you've got one crazy-powerful character.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120999/#Comment_120999" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T12:12:04+00:00" title="January 21, 2008 12:12PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2008 12:12PM by Mike_Sands.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric Provost</cite>Holy crap!

Everyone just wanted to get to the dungeon and kill stuff... they waited in town long enough to be told where the caves were, then they were off!\n<blockquote><p>If someone locks a door, that could kill a connection.

I wasn't thinking that you need to make up rules for this, just add 'some other cunning plan' as one of the things your character might do in a combat round. By having the list of 5 actions, without mentioning other possibilities, <i>might</i> lead some people to only ever choose those actions. So a heads-up that you can do other stuff would be nice. Especially as your specialist gear bonus is specifically not usable in combat actions.\n<blockquote><p>Well, I'm not sure what to tell you here.

Firstly, I didn't realise that the shaman could even hit me. Mike just said "Oh, this guy has a ranged attack. Cool!"... roll... spend some tokens... "You're dead." Secondly, I didn't understand that my character wasn't actually dead. So to me it seemed mighty unfair that I got taken out of the game in one hit. Once it was explained that I was probably going to be okay after the combat, then I was cool with the insta-death, and a lot less gung-ho after that...<br/><br/>As for all taking the same skill: The game is one of the ones where (not counting a range attack advantage) if you move into an enemy region you open yourself up to attack.Not having any defensive capabilities means that if the GM has a bunch of awesome tokens moving into killing distance is effectively suicide. Being able to close on the enemy and fight them in the same turn is <i>incredibly</i> useful. However, I'm not suggesting you fix this at all. RBH is in essence a free form board game, and as you said, if the PCs come up with some uber-tactic the onus is on the GM to find a counter, and vice versa.<br/><br/>Oh and a correction to Mike. We all hit Level 3 near the end that's when we jumped on the "move and fight" bandwagon.<br/><br/>Great game Eric, thanks. And thanks to Mike for running it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121025/#Comment_121025" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T14:01:14+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  2:01PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: netwomble</cite>Once it was explained that I was probably going to be okay after the combat, then I was cool with the insta-death, and a lot less gung-ho after that...</blockquote>\nI think that being less gung-ho is not really the answer... in essence, hanging back to build up awesome tokens just gives your enemies time to maneuver and build up their own.

I'm thinking of something along the lines of:<br/><br/>--You cannot select a talent someone else has unless you are higher level than them.<br/><br/>Or, if players tend to level at the same time (I can't remember how the XP rules work at the moment):<br/><br/>--No one can choose the same talent as another player at any given level (ex: If Bob takes "Homunculus" when he reaches level 2, no one else can choose that when they reach level 2. This kind of parallels the character creation rules.)<br/><br/>Or, even<br/><br/>--Once a character selects a talent, that talent is off-limits until the player has selected a different talent. (I guess you would check them off or mark each character's last selected talent in some other way.)<br/><br/>I'm struggling to get a form of this which is a little less clunky. How does that sound?<br/><br/>I keep thinking there should be some way to get more specialist gear, as well. Or is there already? If so, ignore me...<br/><br/>Finally, a comment on arena-modifying actions: these sound like fun, and should definitely be mentioned in the rules. I would recommend handling them with the "non-combat" conflict resolution rules.

If the players are aware that they have the ability to alter the arenas by way of cool and plausable actions, I think that's more than enough.

One of the dangers is being caught by a patrol... so you use your ring of invisibility to get a +2 on that roll, but once you're in and a fight breaks out, there's no unbalancing effect to worry about.<br/><br/>The magical items act as a way for the characters to act cool and dazzle bystanders outside of combat, or help them get in and out of it in interesting ways (e.g. the good old "feather fall").<br/><br/>As for modifying arenas, I still think some guidance would be useful. If you're the GM, and a player suggests knocking down a wall or whatever, the book really doesn't tell you what to do. It sounds like you used some kind of unopposed Size roll for the monster--that's not really supported by the rules. How do you set the difficulty? I think it would be useful to have some guideline.<br/><br/>It could be as simple as spending Awesome Tokens, of course. You want to collapse the bridge? That'll be 5 Tokens. You only have 2? You'd better Show Off, doing some daring deed to bring it down. Of course, if you don't earn 3 Tokens, you won't be able to succeed... yet.<br/><br/>Know what I mean? <br/><br/>(And, to tie them together: the whole arena modification thing could be another neat use of magical items treated like specialist gear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121131/#Comment_121131" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T21:35:25+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  9:35PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, when I was talking about magic items I was meaning more magic items as fat loot, rather than specialist gear.

The only way to hurt the dragon is with the Sword of Woe. Go get the sword! What's it do? It lets you hurt the dragon.<br/><br/>Then at higher levels, maybe you need to fight an invading army.

No simple +1s or whatever, but rather special plot-device type things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121147/#Comment_121147" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-22T00:04:18+00:00" title="January 22, 2008 12:04AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are great ideas, John.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21" title="Sean ov Newcastle !"><img alt="Sean ov Newcastle !" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21">Sean ov Newcastle !</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121527/#Comment_121527" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-23T12:57:48+00:00" title="January 23, 2008 12:57PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>To make magic items special, though, I would tie them into adventures.

Because, eventually, the magic item won't be of any use anymore.  It will have served it's purpose.  One of the things I'm trying real hard to avoid is letting characters be defined by their stuff.  I mean, sure it's cool to have a ten foot long glowing sword and flying carpet, but it's another thing entirely to feel ripped off when an entire adventure goes by without getting a new toy.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
