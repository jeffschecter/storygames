It isn't a concrete thing or a force.  It's more like the magic in myth, where impossible things happen in a pseudo-storybook way that supports the themes of the fiction.  It's an over-romanticization of reality, basically.  You know how in gothic novels, everything is impossibly overwrought and dripping with angst?  It's like that except the magic in magical realism causes things to drip with... er... uncanny coincidences and powerful imagery.  Sometimes the premise itself of a novel is somewhat fantastical, as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight%27s_Children" rel="nofollow">Midnight's Children</a>, where it's highly allegorical.  But this isn't magic you can turn up to 11.  The magic isn't the dominating force in the fiction, but a kind of color or embellishment.  Nobody focuses on the magic in magical realism, they take it for granted.  That makes it hard to turn it into a traditional RPG mechanic.<br/><br/>The "realism" is also tricky because when you "mechanicize" behaviors in an RPG, you structure them in such a way as to make them unnatural.  You provide incentives for doing certain types of things and disincentives for doing others, which makes the task of "acting naturally" more difficult.  Honestly, I think a more Jeep-like or freeform approach is much, much better for getting at realism in roleplaying, for that reason.<br/><br/>I definitely think magical realism can work in roleplaying, I just think it would need to build on a lot of the more loose and freeformy stuff that people have been working on recently, rather than a game that strictly mechanically structured.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166968/#Comment_166968" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T09:21:24+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  9:21AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Um, play Nine Worlds? <br/><br/>Yeah, yeah.

If I were going for Magical Realism play, my choice would be PTA with a description of magical realism as part of the series description. Maybe a Steal Away Jordan game could be some powerful magical realism, but I'm not sure, having not played it. Poison'd has a strong dose of magical realism, IMHO.<br/><br/>As for mechanics that bring the magical realism, Transantiago looks promising.

You begin by encountering odd things in the subway, and as you return to that site, it escalates bit by bit into the Strange and Weird, eventually transcending. And, the most magical thing about my experience with that game was that  when it transcended, you just <i>knew</i> it.  Something clicked and that thread was ended. Some tragically, some beautifully, others loopily.  <br/><br/>That's the part of magic I'm looking for. The just-so-ness of it. Perhaps not in the Kipling sense, but that kind of fit that one feels sometimes in a game. I guess I am getting at a player experience that when it is matched to a character experience of magic really brings the two into alignment and creates a feeling of wonder and maybe some awe.  Patricia McKillip's work has always delivered that to me and I'm taking a stab at creating it in game in my <a href="http://www.blackgreengames.com/free/hotr.pdf" rel="nofollow">Heart of the Rose</a>.

If a fireball burns through wooden doors one day, it needs to burn through them the next.  Although I haven't played it, I'm very interested in Mutant City Blues because it takes super powers (which a crafty GM could easily replace with magic) and codifies them to a forensic level, allowing the characters in the game to understand supernatural powers in much the same way that a crime scene investigator understands ballistics, DNA testing, or criminal profiling.  Nothing turns back the clock to see exactly what happened, but MCB cops are able to make some assertions about what happened, based on an understood structure.  This idea however requires a lot of prep in advance.<br/><br/>The alternate, which I think GM Steve was getting at is to use Mortal Coil (or a similar system) where realism is established by creating the rules of magic as you go along.  This allows players to make assertions like "We all know magical fire leaves behind a residue of the caster's emotional state", throw some tokens forward and that becomes law. The more this is done the more defined magic comes and the more the players feel they have a grasp of its rules (of magic).  Personally I prefer this method because it takes the work off the GM and give the players a greater sense of ownership and responsibility (if they create wildly contradictory rules of magic, it's their own damn fault).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>The "realism" is also tricky because when you "mechanicize" behaviors in an RPG, you structure them in such a way as to make them unnatural.

It doesn't just affect magic though.  If a fighter in D&amp;D has a +5 Holy Avenger of ass kicking, there is NEVER a reason for him to punch an opponent (at least one he wants to kill) even though cinematically, it would be really cool.  The solution (in my mind) is to remove the granularity.  Take a system like Wushu or PTA and anything you describe is exactly as awesome as you make it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166987/#Comment_166987" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T10:07:36+00:00" title="September  4, 2008 10:07AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2008 10:15AM by Ben_Johnson.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Magical realism seems to demand a couple of things that might be tricky to pull off at the gaming table\n<ul>\n<li>A blending of subjective and objective views of reality where the subjective view of significant events occasionally overwhelms the objective.<ul>\n<li>The trick here is identifying which moments are "significant," and which character's subjective viewpoint becomes the objective viewpoint.</li></ul>\n</li>\n<li>Characters within the story fail to properly appreciate the impossible/wonderous/miraculous events around them<ul>\n<li>When a player does create an awesome blending of the real and the fantastic, the characters in the world are forced to downplay its wonder, even if the players are excitedly high fiving around the table.

The players have a beginning, middle and end to set magical scenes in, and guide the behaviors of the characters. Scenes may or may not be played linearly through time.<br/><br/>For example, a realist story might be: young man received a windfall of $1,000,000 and decides to take a round-the-world trip looking for good causes to donate the money to. However, without a set of criteria for "good cause," compounded with the fear that he might be robbed/killed, this proves extremely difficult. Eventually, he resorts to leaving bundles of money in places where he thinks deserving people will find it. (This is more or less the plot of Dave Eggers' "You Shall Know Our Velocity!")<br/><br/>From that skeleton, scenes are formed. It might also benefit from formally identifying the humanistic themes to be explored (in the above example, the novel dives into themes of loneliness and isolation, guilt, absolution, and grief).<br/><br/>I think that magical realism might benefit from some of the common restrictions in jeepform: namely, fixed characters and plot. Not to say that magical realism needs to be jeep, but that the signature parts of magical realism are a bit like a jazz riff improvised around the set of chords given in the theme. I feel like the crux of the issue here is figuring out how to communicate themes to facilitate that improvisation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166993/#Comment_166993" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T10:34:33+00:00" title="September  4, 2008 10:34AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Johnson</cite><br/>Not to say that magical realism needs to be jeep, but that the signature parts of magical realism are a bit like a jazz riff improvised around the set of chords given in the theme.

Sean/wildduck, what you described about Mortal Coil seems like it would address this.  If the rules of magic are established as they go along, then the themes the players introduce can become a motif the magic harmonizes around. And structuring this could give it that consistent nature as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166995/#Comment_166995" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T10:38:06+00:00" title="September  4, 2008 10:38AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it possible there are two really different definitions of Magical Realism running through this thread right now?

This stands in stark contrast to how most RPGs work.  A magical realism game would have to be very careful not to let the magic of the game setting leak into the resolution mechanics.  Otherwise, you'd just get some flavor of urban fantasy or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167001/#Comment_167001" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T10:54:39+00:00" title="September  4, 2008 10:54AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What are some examples of magical realism genre books?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167004/#Comment_167004" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T11:03:51+00:00" title="September  4, 2008 11:03AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>the thing about magical realism in RPGs is that the magic never resolves any problems \u2014 it may characterize the problem or the resolution of the problem, but magic isn't used as a tool to affect change.</blockquote>\nThis is an excellent point. Magic-as-flavor is something that runs counter to most gamers' expectations. Any game that tries to sell itself thus needs to be able to manage those expectations effectively. Also, because magical realism externalizes internal conflicts, it lends itself to stories that are more plotless psychological revelation than ripping adventure yarn.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167006/#Comment_167006" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T11:07:14+00:00" title="September  4, 2008 11:07AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first thing that comes to mind is Gabriel Garcia Marquez's <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/One-Hundred-Years-Solitude-P-S/dp/0060883286/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1220551301&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">One Hundred Years of Solitude</a></i>.<br/><br/>To my mind, magical realism at the gaming table may best be served with oracular game mechanics of the kind that you see in In A Wicked Age and Ganakagok, for instance, where the oracle serves as to introduce fantastical elements to an otherwise mundane fiction in a way that requires them to be accepted by the characters but noted as strange or remarkable by the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167009/#Comment_167009" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T11:10:13+00:00" title="September  4, 2008 11:10AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2008 11:11AM by J_Walton.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism" rel="nofollow">The wikipedia article on magical realism</a> is actually really good, if people want to give it a peek.<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Eggers" rel="nofollow">Eggers' untrue autobiographies</a> are great recent examples, Ben, though I guess <i>What Is the What</i> is somewhat different in that respect.

And Doctorow's Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town in which the hero's parents are a mountain and a washing machine. But generally genre is excluded from magical realism. These are books in which otherwise ordinary places have unexplained magical events happening in them. <br/><br/>In fact, to a certain extent, magical realism exists as a category so some authors don't have to be classified as genre, Angela Carter, Jeanette Winterson, Italo Calvino, although more properlu I think it arose in South America in the 60s as a mixing of realism and magical events as a reaction to the upheavals of the time. In any case the boundaries the are not clear.<br/><br/>I'm totally with the explanations by Emily and Sean as to how Mortal Coil supports magical realism by allowing the definition of magv, magical events, what the characters and the world can do, unfold as the game takes place. The fact that the magical metarules can be as loose as you like means that you can perhaps more easily approach the theme of magical realism without constraining it.

American Gods is closer than Neverwhere, but it's still like "hey, look at all this crazy weirdness."

(The wiki article quotes a Gene Wolfe quip: magic realism as "fantasy written in Spanish.")<br/><br/>Here are some bullet points from the article I think are of interest:\n<ul>\n<li>The fantastic elements may be intuitively "logical" but are rarely explained<br/></li><li>Characters accept rather than question the logic of the magical element<br/></li><li>Exhibits a richness of sensory details<br/></li><li>Uses symbolism and imagery extensively.<br/></li><li>Presents events from multiple perspectives, such as those of belief and disbelief or the colonizers and the colonized<br/></li><li>Creates uncertainty in the reader, who has to discern whether to believe in the magical or the realist interpretation of the events in the story, and to what extent.</li>\n</ul>\nSo, from these bullet points (which are at least a kind of guide), I think there are a lot of things we do in RPGs that would have be re-tooled for Magic Realism.<br/><br/>We're used to the "magic" being manipulated by the protagonists in RPGs.  But not so much in Magical Realism.  The Magic is "out there" -- sometimes seen by a protagonist, sometimes not, but always seen by the <i>READER</i>.<br/><br/>The uses of imagery and sensory details depends <i>not</i> on immersion or seeing things from a PC's point of view, but an author's or narrator's point of view.  Players must step outside the description or details for the enjoyment of the rest of the group -- describing things that might not even be from the PC's point of view (though the PC might be seeing it) but as a condition of the world.  (The woman who simply ascends because she is too beautiful, from <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i>...   We don't get this from her point of view.  We don't get it from anyone's point of view except the author -- who is telling this fact to the reader.<br/><br/>Expanding on that point, there is a "reality" beyond the reality of the characters -- the reality of fiction and details that normally are the province of a GM in a game, but I think would be better served by everyone having a crack at bat.<br/><br/>Most RPGs are built more along the lines of Dramatic Narrative (that is, conflict between characters, like in plays or movies).  Magic Realism, I think, is more the province of Narrative, which is work of novels and prose, where the accumulation of details, the choice of words and descriptions is part of the joy of the experience moreso than the plot or conflict.  (Here I'm stepping outside the works of say, Crichton or Grisham, which are kind screenplays waiting to be written, and sticking with work that really only works effectively in its native form of novel.)  So such a game wouldn't be about "What does the PC do?" but "What does the Player <i>say</i>?"<br/><br/>Shifting POVs would seem to make sense.  Either sharing characters, or switching characters, or shifting in and out of Player/GM role, or something.... I don't know.  But something where the Players are attached to seeing the world from one POV but seeing the world as BIGGER than one PC can imagine -- on a regular, poetic basis would be key.  (If such a thing is possible.  I'm just talking here!)<br/><br/>Mundane activities -- and I mean that literally, so that "war" is mundane -- is the "focus" of activity for the PCs... so that the Magic Realism gets to pop out in contrast.<br/><br/>Genuinely giving up on building Plot (again, a needed focus for Dramatic Narrative, but not so much for sheer Narrative), so that the moments of realization, emotion, sensory detail, realizations about life and so on are the focus.  <br/><br/>Anyway, those are some thoughts about the RPG version off the top of my head.<br/><br/>I think it'd be a radically different game than a lot of other games -- but my guess is a game or games like this are already out there and I haven't played them yet. <br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167029/#Comment_167029" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T12:20:24+00:00" title="September  4, 2008 12:20PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>Genuinely giving up on building Plot</blockquote>\nI think this is important.  Magical realism is more exploratory in nature than many other fictional forms.  Even more ridiculous novels like, um, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_Life_with_Woodpecker" rel="nofollow">Still Life with Woodpecker</a>, in which a great deal of stuff happens, have this sense that the stuff that's happening is not what matters.  The most important thing is almost <i>the experience of reading the prose</i> more than the content of the narrative.  The prose is intentionally provocative and evocative and the reader is aware of how it effects them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167032/#Comment_167032" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T12:36:52+00:00" title="September  4, 2008 12:36PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think magical realism, whoever coined that anyway, is about leaving magic mysterious.<br/>Not feeling the need to explain it away, and just try and tell a decent story about people.<br/>The more you focus on it(magic), the more it just becomes a device, just like any other thing.<br/>Let it be less of a device and leave it open to interpretation.<br/>Many styles of new and old media do this kinda thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jbuchert" title="jbuchert"><img alt="jbuchert" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jbuchert">jbuchert</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167034/#Comment_167034" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T12:43:02+00:00" title="September  4, 2008 12:43PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2008 12:43PM by jbuchert.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite><br/>Genuinely giving up on building Plot (again, a needed focus for Dramatic Narrative, but not so much for sheer Narrative), so that the moments of realization, emotion, sensory detail, realizations about life and so on are the focus.</blockquote>\nNow I don't know how relevant this is, but it is interesting...<br/><br/>But that's what immersion is all about, right?<br/><br/>Joachim Buchert                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167036/#Comment_167036" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T12:49:57+00:00" title="September  4, 2008 12:49PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2008 12:53PM by Jesse.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite><br/>Most RPGs are built more along the lines of Dramatic Narrative (that is, conflict between characters, like in plays or movies).

Sort of. I do see the magic in Magical Realism as largely being about introducing situation or whatever (to the point where I see Magical Realism elements in non-Magical Realism works like The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly). However, while I think it's important that the characters don't question the magic, I think it might be very fitting for the players to question the magic (in fact, if they don't, I have trouble seeing it as Magical Realism; like, we don't question the magic in D&amp;D, we recognize that it doesn't belong in our world, but we feel it belongs in their world). And I think a game would be best served by employing play techniques to push for that rather than simply having some kind of player/GM advice section.<br/><br/>In fact, I would expect their would be some dissonance between character and player in a Magical Realism game. I would expect that the player should end up saying, "what the fuck? That makes no sense," while the characters should just go on with the scene as if nothing was out of place, as if nothing magical was happening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167056/#Comment_167056" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T13:40:34+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  1:40PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2008 1:43PM by Josh Roby.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, a very easy-to-grasp example of magical realism is if you took Ally McBeal and let everybody see all the crazy stuff that only she sees.<br/><br/>I'm going to draw a little diagram, here.\n<blockquote><cite>"Normal" Sci-fi and Fantasy Stuff</cite>Weird Shit ---&gt; Conflicts</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Magical Realism</cite>Conflicts ---&gt; Weird Shit</blockquote>\nSteven King doesn't do much Magical Realism because the weird shit in his stories produce the conflicts or increase tension on the conflicts or whatever else.

For every action/conflict, you can choose to do things magically or naturally. The only difference this makes is in the narration; both magic and natural actions can compete and resolve against one another. In fact, if it weren't for the advancement system (or whatever Matt would like to call it), the choice wouldn't mean much at all. Of course, that the choice ties into character development means it is a meaningful choice.

I know realized by "explore" I meant, "Have consequences and produce tension and conflict" rather than just being presented as an admirable thing on its own.<br/><br/>Jesse<br/><br/>Me too, Jesse. I think there's a literary fiction/genre fiction distinction here too. In literary fiction, often, very little actually happens as a result of the characters' actions, or the central characters' actions anyway. The story isn't about <b>what protagonists do</b>, as in genre fiction, but about <b>what characters experience</b>. <br/><br/>Personally I usually find that unsatisfying, and I don't think it's essential to either magic realism or literary fiction - certainly in pre-20th-century literary fiction, protagonists were frequently doing things. I tend to reject that as a necessary distinction between genre fiction and literary fiction and look for well-written, evocative, non-cliched fiction that also involves characters who are protagonists, who are having an impact on the world.<br/><br/>So there are a few ways we could approach a magical realist RPG, and some of the design decisions we made would depend on our stance on the issues above. If I were writing one for my tastes, I might stipulate that the magic, simply as such, is not a tool which people can pick up and use to achieve things. It's an element of the setting which is largely colour, without direct mechanical effect on events. However, if you give it <b>meaning</b> - if you link it in to what characters are like and what they think and feel and what their issues are - it can become an element of changes that go on internally for the characters, changes of perspective, feeling, priority - which is the literary side - and these in turn can be the basis for taking effective action in the world, for bringing things about in the fiction, which is the other side. <br/><br/>If your tastes run more to the kind of fiction which is usually put in the "magical realism" category, where characters don't have much agency, you could drop that second part.<br/><br/>Layering of detail would have to be an important part of emulating this particular type of writing, too, so again, if I was designing this, it would probably require a certain amount of description before an element of the world would be powerful enough to have an effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167069/#Comment_167069" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T14:05:11+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  2:05PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: tony dowler</cite>PTA give players a way to resolve strongly felt internal issues without a great deal of constraint as to how the resolution is narrated.

My point about PTA is that is leaves you room to achieve magical realism, though it doesn't necessarily foster that. Your group still needs to have agreement about the color. <br/><br/>A lot of games have mechanisms for reincorporating certain symbols or elements of play.

In reading the first thread (on story and scene framing) I was reminded of the "Burkean pentad" of act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose (with which I must confess only a passing familiarity, but it's on my list of stuff to learn). Kenneth Burke argued that in any given instance drama emerges from the "friction" between some pair of those elements. For example, a little girl (agent) may curl up and shiver (act) beneath her blankets (agency) because she is afraid of monsters (purpose) in her bedroom (scene). Burke talks about the relationship between any given pair of elements as a "ratio," so the "scene-act ratio" is the tension or friction between where the action takes place and what takes place there. So if the bedroom were warm and cozy and decorated with smiling princesses but the little girl nonetheless remained huddled in a ball, you'd say the scene-act ratio was a source of friction, contributing at least impressionistically to the drama. Right? Because it says something that the little girl's room offers no comfort.<br><br/>In any event, the value of this to Humble Mythologies (or any other magic-realist game relying on explicit framing rules) might be as an "inventional tool" -- a way for figuring out where the magic breaks through in any given scene, if it does. So you frame your scene by relying on the Burkean pentad (which is basically just who, what, where &amp; when, how, and why) and then let your game mechanics tell you between which pair to introduce the friction.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cirv" title="Cirv"><img alt="Cirv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cirv">Cirv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167100/#Comment_167100" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T16:26:13+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  4:26PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2008 4:26PM by Cirv.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So would, say, the movie Brazil be an example of Magical Realism?

However, if you give it<b>meaning</b>- if you link it in to what characters are like and what they think and feel and what their issues are - it can become an element of changes that go on internally for the characters, changes of perspective, feeling, priority - ... - and these in turn can be the basis for taking effective action in the world, for bringing things about in the fiction...<br/><br/>Layering of detail would have to be an important part of emulating this particular type of writing, too, so again, if I was designing this, it would probably require a certain amount of description before an element of the world would be powerful enough to have an effect.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167129/#Comment_167129" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T18:25:26+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  6:25PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2008 7:02PM by Number6intheVillage.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As pointed out, it's not Magic + Reality, but it's not Magic as Color, and it's not Narrative for no purpose other than an evocative experience either. (A lot of the literary discussion above is awfully dated.) The "magic" is an intrinsic part of the thematics and is the catalyst for the characters' development.<br/><br/><span style="color: #660000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"...if you give it meaning - if you link it in to what characters are like and what they think and feel and what their issues are - it can become an element of changes that go on internally for the characters, changes of perspective, feeling, priority - which is the literary side - and these in turn can be the basis for taking effective action in the world...."<br/></span></span><br/>Except for the fact that that statement seems to privilege "taking effective action in the world" over internal development, that sums it up for me. So you need a system that both allows players to change the way the game world works - and rewards them for doing so - in ways that primarily explore their characters' internal development (while secondarily resolving game-world issues or conflicts).<br/><br/>I think a system like that used in Bacchanal would work. The more control you want players to have over the game world, the more formal the metagame needs to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/schlafmanko" title="schlafmanko"><img alt="schlafmanko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/schlafmanko">schlafmanko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167140/#Comment_167140" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T19:56:39+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  7:56PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2008 8:00PM by schlafmanko.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can't stay to talk because I'm planning a funeral, but how 'bout It Was A Mutual Decision?

Sure, no problem. However, see below. <br/><br/>Do anything, anything at all, that does not feel emotionally and personally real and blood honest? You've fucked it.<br/><br/>Of course, the crux of that is that to really hit magical realism you have to believe, on some level at least, that the suspension of the laws of logic is real. Like I said you can be so pretty you fly off into the sky -- unless you think that isn't really real, in which case you can't. What's really real and what's real and what isn't are all local, all contingent, all based on the paradigm and mythology of those writing/reading/playing. <br/><br/>So pretty much, you need something that will bring a group together in a way that allows them to create a soul-honest personal and group mythology in which logic, cause and effect, and empirical constraint do not rule, but joint emotional realism, vision, and symbolism (not metaphor, full fucking symbolism) do. <br/><br/>Given that most RPGs try to get us together about the reality of the fiction, rather than the reality of our own emotion, there comes a problem.<br/><br/>(No, not an insurmountable problem, but a problem none the less. It isn't as simple as doing the same things with different dice. We have to actually do something full different.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167145/#Comment_167145" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T20:16:00+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  8:16PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2008 8:22PM by MikeRM.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [Warning: Possible threadcrap, if so, use your judgement and ignore me]<br/><br/>Well, there we differ, Brand, and it may be differing experiences/definitions of MR or differing experiences/definitions of what is emotionally real, but I can think of at least one outstanding counterexample - Gene Wolfe. <br/><br/>The reason I have repeatedly failed to like his work despite my best efforts is exactly this. <i>Castleview</i>, I think, could probably be classed as magical realism. A guy who turns out to be King Arthur kills your girlfriend's father in Fairyland, shortly after your own father is killed? No problem. You see this same guy, at the end of the book, going into your mother's bedroom with her and it's evident that they're probably going to have sex, and you just kind of wonder if you'll mention this to your girlfriend, without any particular evidence that you feel any outrage or distress at your father being replaced (in a matter of, I think, a few weeks) by the killer of your girlfriend's father?<br/><br/>No, sorry, Gene. Not going to happen in the emotional universe I'm familiar with.<br/><br/>(OK, sorry, that pushed one of my buttons, you probably should ignore me.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167147/#Comment_167147" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T20:26:09+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  8:26PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2008 8:42PM by Brand_Robins.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, <br/><br/>Heh. <br/><br/>See, I can see where some would say that Gene may write Magical Realism, but I wouldn't classify him as such. Mostly because I don't believe that he believes that King Arthur could be there. Not really. Its a metaphor. Its a trope. Its fantastic. It isn't real to him. Its pop culture metaphor standing in for local paradigm mythology, and so doesn't cut the bone the way it should.  He's writing about this other world that is pretty close to ours, where Magical Realist authors are writing about their own world seen in a different lens than the audience is used to reading about it in, but which the author still believes in. (That being the big line for me between, say, Urban Fantasy and Secret History and Magical Realism.) <br/><br/>But hell, Wolf himself once defined magical realism as "fantasy written in Spanish." So I could be wrong. Genres are slippery like that. <br/><br/>In which case I'd just say that Gene writes pretty good fantasy and pretty shitty magical realism. <br/><br/>If you want to do that urban fantasy style magical realism (aka urban fantasy, aka otherwise secret history), there are games to do it. But to me the more interesting question is how to do One Hundred Years of Solitude, Beloved, or Midnight's Children (which all of you should read, btw, as they are 3 of the 10 best books of the 20th century) -- how to do the emotionally real.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167155/#Comment_167155" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T21:51:16+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  9:51PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, I REALLY like what Brand said.

Internal issues find expression the external world through fantastical events, but they don't necessarily find resolution there. <br/><br/>I'm imagining a magical realism game that uses a mechanic that builds the tension of a conflict from scene to scene as "...the lines of demarcation that separates what seems real from what seems fantastic (to paraphrase from Gabriel Garcia Marquez)" are broken down. Only after a certain amount of warping has occurred in our "real" world, is the conflict potentially resolved. Of course, the conflict in question would have to be central to the PC and I think you would need all the characters to be centered around the one conflict, rather than spreading the narrative across multiple conflicts, all producing fantastical changes in the environment. Also, the changes wouldn't be random, but thematic (like the passion instilled by the cook's passion in <i>Like Water For Chocolate</i>).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167166/#Comment_167166" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T22:43:09+00:00" title="September  4, 2008 10:43PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite>Layering of detail would have to be an important part of emulating this particular type of writing, too, so again, if I was designing this, it would probably require a certain amount of description before an element of the world would be powerful enough to have an effect.</blockquote>I just saw this in the thread and realized Mike and I are on a similar vibe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage" title="Number6intheVillage"><img alt="Number6intheVillage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.johnkantor.com/miscl/prisoner_ringtiny.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Number6intheVillage">Number6intheVillage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167176/#Comment_167176" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-05T01:25:53+00:00" title="September  5, 2008  1:25AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do you enforce "a certain amount of description"?

Alvin Frewer <br/><br/><span style="color: #660000;">in fantasy magic tends to be a means or a tool.

With <em><a href="http://thefifthworld.com" rel="nofollow">The Fifth World</a></em>, I want to to give domesticated people like most of us a glimpse of traditional ontology and epistemology.  Part of that means modeling the game on oral tradition, but it also requires examining bridges already built\u2014like magical realism.<br/><br/>I don't think magical realism could have emerged anywhere but in Latin America.  There, traditional people have had a long time to live alongside and with domesticated people.  I think really getting to the heart of magical realism stems from that.  From domesticated epistemology, magical realism involves this surreal suspension of logic, where the interior state finds expression in the exterior.  But in the traditional epistemologies that inform so much of Latin America, this does not conflict with realism whatsoever.  Interior does not differ from exterior; <a href="http://sac.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/4/365" rel="nofollow">imagination and intelligence do not originate in the human skull</a>, but form an ecological relationship that humans <em>partake in</em>, rather than create ourselves.  I think the intense creativity of magical realism and its vibrancy in modern literature really illustrates how much the ecological concept of "<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/gw3044417231v157/" rel="nofollow">edge</a>," so critical to permaculture design, extends into our traditions.  I see magical realism as an obvious edge between the "world-as-machine" epistemology of the post-Cartesian West and the <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/writers/graham_harvey" rel="nofollow">animist</a> <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/200061?journalCode=ca" rel="nofollow">epistemology</a> of traditional people.<br/><br/>The implication there, I think, illustrates why we have such a hard time coming up with a mechanic to drive a game in a magical realist direction.  You can't tack on magical realism as an afterthought; you can't put it on a bullet list of criteria to meet.  It has to emerge from the most basic, underlying logic of your project.  I have grave doubts that you can really do magical realism justice unless, to one degree or another, you can take magic seriously as a real thing.  I've just finished a playable, playtest draft of my game, so we'll see if it works out on the table as well as it does in my imagination, but I abandoned the hope of any kind of magical realist mechanic some time ago.  Instead, I based the most basic, underlying assumptions of the game in a traditional epistemology.  For instance, that people don't have attributes, traits or characteristics; that people exist primarily as nodes of relationships.  I think the magical realism will follow from those premises; after all, the vibrancy of magical realism in literature really comes from nothing more than the injection of traditional epistemology into the domesticated imagination.<br/><br/>I have seen a trend among those books that have helped me most; they all seem to start with a proposition of, "What if we try to understand traditional cultures in their own terms, and dare to ask, if only for a moment, how their outlook could make sense, without dismissing them as either liars, fools or madmen?"  A tall order, as Tim Ingold points out, when confronted with stories of how people changed shape and flew through the sky, admittedly.

Even if you set out specifically to remove that from your brain, you know it\u2014you can't unknow it.  But nearly all of us look at animist beliefs as quaint, backwards, or superstitious.  Taking them seriously presents a huge challenge for us.  We already have one element firmly established, so to create that edge, you need to introduce the second element\u2014really introduce it, take it seriously, not just pay it lip service.  You have to really take the time to wrap your brain around it and treat it as seriously as your current viewpoint.<br/><br/>While our experience as readers of magical realism often roots in that conflict between the impossibility of magic vs. its undeniably real nature in the story, I think for the magical realist artist, it comes from the edge of two epistemologies in the same brain, one that denies the existence of magic, and one that sees it as the fundamental unit of reality.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167365/#Comment_167365" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-05T21:08:21+00:00" title="September  5, 2008  9:08PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Attacks by a strange, fey enemy bring out hidden, subconscious neuroses.  <br/><br/>You fight this enemy in dreams, armed only with love, hatred, and friendship.<br/><br/>A relationship to an emotionally distant, sensual lover allows you to lob fire - just don't get too close to it, or you will burn.<br/><br/>The final battle takes place on the dark side of the moon, and the titanic blows, invader and human alike, permanently leaves the moon a crecent in thier wake.<br/><br/><i>Bliss Stage </i>is anything <b><i>other</i></b> than magical realism?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167369/#Comment_167369" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-05T21:24:59+00:00" title="September  5, 2008  9:24PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2008 9:45PM by Brand_Robins.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Elliot, <br/><br/>Bliss Stage is awesome for all the reasons cited, and played right gets somewhat towards the emotional honesty I was talking about. <br/><br/>But I'd still call it Science Fantasy, rather than Magical Realism, as the whole dark side of the moon and titanic blows are rather outside the realism part. They're high romanticism at its finest, and speculate a different world to populate with our desires and fears, rather than manifesting them in our own world, and thus not quite in the genre in many ways.

First, many of us do have magical thinking of one type or another, the trick is finding it out and recognizing it as magical thinking rather than the rationalism we assume it is. (The way many people deal with and understand communication technology, for example, has more to do with magical thinking that the science that makes it go.) Second, several important authors whose works are often cited in the genre are western educated intellectuals, even if they do have other cultural backgrounds and elements of the other that allow them some breadth of background. Thing about that is, many of us have elements of otherness, elements outside the bog standard center, if just we take the time to realize them. <br/><br/>Really, magical realism is about moving outside the global standard paradigm of logos centric thought. The problem we've got is that a lot of our games are logos centric, and we come from a culture that often fetishizes that. But we all also have more to us (I'd hope) than just that, and if we can let a little of that go and see other parts of ourselves and those we play with, maybe we can get towards having some actual sense that we do have magical thought patterns, and they do influence our way of thinking and seeing. <br/><br/>All that said, I think you're dead right that any real magical realism that most of us create is going to look very different than most of the early cannon -- after all, our mythology and ontology are of a different order, and thus to be real to us must produce different output. <br/><br/>(Also worth mentioning that as soon as I started in on this thread I couldn't help but think about your reading of John Hughes and the creation of personal myths. Really, that's something RPGs do well already, and that would have great potential if we moved forward on. That's the place where we're going to find that many of us really do believe two different things at once.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167378/#Comment_167378" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-06T01:36:58+00:00" title="September  6, 2008  1:36AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, maybe someone like Thorne Smith might be a bit avant la lettre to the movement and give you a perspective?<br/>In a Thorne Smith novel, the protagonist usually pusues a disatisfying modern life while a supernaturally-endowed hedonist tries to shake him or her out of it.<br/>That role is taken away from an active antagonist in the magical realism novel and transferred to the setting itself.<br/><br/>So, you have a group of characters in a community, any community, and all of them are dissatisfied somehow.<br/>   Each player develops a social life and concerns for a character as well as a central disatisfaction - something the character can't breach by normal means.<br/><br/>Then the players all brainstorm one impossible thing that all of them have experienced. They have all experienced this impossible thing, or, at least, an aspect of it, but they might not have all experienced it at the same time... or in the same place... or in the same way.<br/><br/>During the game, the players pursue their characters' lives.<br/>It's mechanically easy to do something mundane and emotionally unrewarding, something you are expected to do. Something your role in society demands.<br/>You should probably make a list of these demands at the start of the game.<br/>For each one, list something nice and mundane that your character should want, but doesn't.<br/>(A gold watch. A pretty painting. A rich husband. A political position. Tenure. It really depends on the individual players' tastes.)<br/><br/>Whenever you try to do something more emotionally rewarding, you have to add weird shit to the one impossible thing at the center of all this.<br/>It calls to you. You hear the story of that woman who was so beautiful she flew. The elevator exists again, this morning. <br/>White Cordelia is being served at the bistro. The weather argues with you. The children explain how to find the secret color in the crayon box.<br/>Each level, layer, die, card or point of weird shit you add disrupts your life more - ripping away another... uh... social hit point.<br/>Add a stigma or a problem or a new obligation your pursuit of this weird shit has imposed upon your character.<br/><br/>If your physical rewards outstrip your emotional rewards, you hit a breaking point.<br/>The other players describe how that one impossible thing tries to consume you. As if you don't belong in the world and it does.<br/>You can try to fight it, but at a dear cost.<br/>The alternative is losing everything... or your stakes or however you wanted to set that up.<br/><br/>If your emotional rewards outstrip your material/physical rewards, you transform.<br/>The material world accepts you as a new kind of impossible thing. Or a new part of the old impossible thing.<br/>The laws, duties and rules that you live by change.<br/>But does that really bring you satisfaction?<br/><br/>I dunno, I was just riffing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_167413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167413/#Comment_167413" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-06T09:39:51+00:00" title="September  6, 2008  9:39AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 6, 2008 9:43AM by Marshall Burns.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unless Borges counts, I know nothing about magical realism.  I do, however, know a thing or two about occult philosophy, and some of the above comments triggered a bit of something that might be relevant and/or helpful to some of you folks, so I'ma post it.<br/><br/>Please don't ask me for research to back it up; it's assembled from so many sources that I have no way of doing that.  That, and I'll second William S. Burroughs when he says that it's not necessary to prove, only to state.<br/><br/>Here's hoping this ain't a can-opener to a can of worms.<br/><br/><i><br/>THING #1: Rational, Magical, Communal<br/>There are, that I know of, three general worldviews. By "worldview," I mean a model for the nature of reality and causality.<br/><br/>The rational worldview says that the world we experience is an objective reality that can be measured, perceived, and comprehended. It says that causality is linear: a cause produces an effect at some point later in time. This should all sound familiar, because this is the worldview used by nearly all Westerners, as well as all the "modern" cultures. This is also the worldview used by early cultures in their so-called sympathetic magic (not actually magic at all).<br/><br/>The magical worldview says that reality is abstract and incomprehensible, and that the world we experience is a metaphor for that reality. It says that causality is synchronous: one abstract force overcomes a conflicting abstract focre, and as a result we experience both the cause and the effect. This is a simple concept but hard to explain. For an example, let's say you shot me to death. By a magical worldview, I didn't die because the bullet damaged vital organs; what really happened is that, in some abstract arena, your power overcame mine and as a result of that, you had an opportunity to shoot me with a gun, you pulled the trigger, the powder detonated and propelled the bullet out of the gun, the bullet hit me and damaged vital organs, AND my body shut down from the trauma. The role of time in all this is irrelevant, because time too is just a metaphor. I believe that this worldview was common in ancient cultures, and I also believe that it is common in young children even today. It's also the approach necessary to make sense of most religions, especially Eastern ones.<br/><br/>The communal worldview says that there are many different worlds (dreams are a world, memories are a world, thoughts are a world, the Land of the Dead is a world, specific times of day are worlds), and that they are all real, and that they are all subjective. It says that causality is relative: the functioning factor is your relationship with things. That is, if you stub your toe on a chair, it is not because you moved your foot where that chair happened to be; it is because your relationship with that chair is strained in some way--the chair was angry at you, so it hurt you. If you caught a deer, it was not because your tracking skill enabled you to; it is because, through tracking, you contacted the deer, created a relationship with it, and it offered itself to you. This worldview is common in aboriginal cultures, and it was probably also used by early Britons and Picts. It's also sometimes known as animism.<br/><br/>(Note also that most people who hold a magical or communal worldview would not describe it in the logical terms that I used. They instead would use experiential, anecdotal terms that sound like symbol, delusion, and/or falsehoods to Western ears.)<br/><br/>These worldviews, while seemingly contradictory, are not mutually exclusive. It is not uncommon for one person to use more than one. In Europe in the Middle Ages, the dominant worldview was a combination of the rational and magical. This sort of cognitive dissonance sounds very strange and impossible at first, so I'll give you an example of how it works. Let's take the oil situation these days. According to a rational worldview, there is a limited amount of oil in the world, and as it is used, the amount decreases; therefore, we are running out of it. According to a magical worldview, OIL (as a concept) is losing its power. According to a communal worldview, our relationship with oil has become aberrant and dysfunctional.<br/><br/>The thing is, if you look at these explanations with an open mind, they aren't contradictory. I'd go so far as to say they are all true. That is how a culture can use more than one. Interestingly enough, no matter which one or combination thereof is dominant in a given culture, that culture's sorcerors and wizards (but not necessarily their shamans) will almost always use all three, picking between them for whichever is best for the situation.<br/></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Piers" title="Piers"><img alt="Piers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Piers">Piers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167434/#Comment_167434" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-06T15:29:34+00:00" title="September  6, 2008  3:29PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, Brand,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite><br/>In which case I'd just say that Gene writes pretty good fantasy and pretty shitty magical realism.<br/></blockquote>\nI'd probably agree about Castleview, but not so much in the case of Peace.
