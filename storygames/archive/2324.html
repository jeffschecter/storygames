                    So I've begun to hear back from my external playtesters of The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries, my storytelling game of pulp exploration from last year's Game Chef. The common theme in their feedback has been that there are too many options for gaining and spending the game's primary currency, resulting in too much to keep track of during play. The game is primarily intended to be gamist, with the currency manipulation informing your free-form narration as you overcome appropriately pulpy hazards. But the proof is in the playtesting - I've overdesigned this sucker and need to start paring it down. I'm not sure I know how to go about killing my darlings, though.<br/><br/>I'm sure this isn't the first time a designer has run into the problem of overdesign and excess complexity, so I'd love to hear how you've tackled your own overdesign problems and culled ideas in later development. How have you handled the results from external playtesting, especially when they bring up issues you didn't see yourself when playtesting locally? I know these reports are the best gauge of whether my game is working like I want it to, and I want to get the most of the time and effort folks have put into giving my game a go (for which I am very grateful). <br/><br/>More generally, I guess I'm asking about the stages of design after initial playtesting has worked out the kinks and others have begun to weigh in with their thoughts. Where do I go from here?<br/><br/>By the way, if you're interested in taking a look at my current draft of the game, please let me know. I'd be happy to get more feedback.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Eric                </div>

                            Good question, Eric!  I struggle with this myself currently.  For me it isn't a question of killing the babies - I'll gladly smother the little bastards if it makes the game better, but I can't decide if it will or not.  I mean, I know <i>why </i>features are in place, but there are so many dependencies that I can't tell if the "over design" candidates are actually problematic, or just symptomatic of some other lurking lameness.  More eyes, more eyes.  <br/><br/>Something related I've learned that is good to say out loud - at some point you need to call it baked.  It may be a little pink in the middle still, but that's inevitable.  If the game is functional and fun to play, let it go.  Obsessive re-writing and tinkering may do more harm than good.                        </div>

                            The good news is that at least it's not under-designed.<br/>
<br/>
What I do at this stage is to look for serendipitious chances to use one mechanic for more than one thing. That is, what you may find is that you can still get all the effects you want by rolling some category of action into another creating a larger category.<br/>
<br/>
That's very abstract, I know, but I find it happens a lot. What's cool is often the resulting mechanic is far, far more interesting than the original because of the "crossing" of the purposes.<br/>
<br/>
Like...let's say that in designing Hero Quest, that Laws had decided to have "Character Points" along with the "Hero Points." The former only for spending on raising character abilities or buying new ones, and the latter only for bumping up contest rolls. Well, you look at the two currencies and say, "Hmm. What if I used the one for both purposes?" Which is exactly what HQ does, and which creates some interesting second-order effects that are highly beneficial in terms of the stress between wanting to use them for one purpose or the other.<br/>
<br/>
So combine some mechanics, and see what comes out of it.<br/>
<br/>

                            Here's my take, Eric. (I'm one of these playtesters, by the way, who found the acclaim stuff a little much for the group).<br><br>Firstly, what Mike Holmes said.<br><br>Secondly, look at what you want to encourage and work out how much needs to be done to encourage it. I think you may have a few goals that are being pushed by multiple mechanics when less will do the job. <br><br>As a specific example from Committee...: the expedition log. It seems to me that the purpose of this is to focus narration on recurring elements and keep things tied to the expedition as originally brainstormed. You allow investment in the things written on the log and various rewards based on using elements that people have invested in. <br><br>However, maybe just having them written down is sufficient (I suspect that it would be for us, but maybe not all groups)? Can the reward for using these elements be simpler (this is probably the best solution, in my opinion - just find something with less handling time)? I'm sure there are other solutions that meet the goal and reduce complexity, but those are the two that immediately spring to my mind.<br><br>I'd like to add that the game is fantastic and we had a great time (I wrote an actual play report on <a href="http://gamesteratlarge.blogspot.com/2007/01/playtest-report-committee-for.html" rel="nofollow">my blog, here</a>, for those who want more detail on how it plays). <br/><br/>Take Eric up on his offer and grab a playtest draft!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Eric, could I suggest a sort of exercise? I'd suggest writing a 10-page version of Committee For The Exploration Of Mysteries, reducing mechanics to the minimum (to start with, this probably just means character creation, a hazard list and the mechanics for overcoming single-player hazards). Then add things back in if they're needed.<br/><br/>I'm suggesting this because a. There's a lot of rules you could take out without affecting the game much (e.g. A Sudden Insight) and b. I think that, like me, you've got a tendency to overwrite. I wonder, in fact, if part of the problem is overwriting rather than overdesigning: perhaps the rules seem more complex than they are.<br/><br/>Also, Jason suggested I do a similar thing for my game, and it helped.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Thanks for all the responses so far.<br/><br/>That sounds like a great exercise, Graham. I do overwrite things, I know (being a lawyer has a tendency to do that to your prose), and that may be making my rules text less clear than the underlying mechanics actually are.<br/><br/>I think I'll go through the draft and try Mike H's idea, too - combining whenever possible. <br/><br/>Mike S, I've now heard similar things from another playtest group, too, so reducing complexity is my main focus now. Like Jason mentioned, though, I know why I put everything where its at, now I just have to remove some things and see if the game holds together just as well (or even takes off without the extra weight). <br/><br/>And I appreciate hearing the admonition that a game just needs to be left alone at some point. It's so tough to put into practice, especially with your first design intended for publication.<br/><br/>I'll say this, taking a game design beyond its initial conception to the hard part of playtesting and further development has put me in awe of the published designers around here and the amount of work they've done in making the games I've enjoyed so much. This stuff is not for the faint of heart.                        </div>

                            Eric,<br/><br/>As one of your external playtesters, and uncertain about how much of our feedback got back to you:<br/><br/>First of all, strike at least half of the things that you can spend Acclaim on.  We found we just weren't spending it to screw each other very often, so about half of the options on the sheet were just distracting.<br/><br/>Second of all, as far as we could tell, the connections in the adventure log were superfluous.  And the invest/refer mechanism was a little byzantine.  A thought that occurred was that you get Acclaim for the references between items you add to the log.  So: costs 1 to start an item, immediate payback for each connection to existing log items, and payback for references made by others.                        </div>

                            I was overengineering <a href="http://verge.legendary.org/" rel="nofollow">Verge</a>. The playtest version on the site now is the overbuilt one. Basically, as problems came up in playtesting, I grafted on new rules to handle them. The thing became this Frankenstein's monster of a game that had three types of token currency, dice currency, and written network map currency that included three different symbols.<br/><br/>I recommend doing what I did. Talk to some smart local folks (I envy you your geography!) about the problems you have with the game and gut it. I suspect you're trying to solve a problem and didn't find the right elegant solution yet. We gutted Verge at Dreamation this weekend and took bits and pieces from it and built an awesome thing out of the parts. It's much much simpler and a lot of fun.                        </div>

                            One of my favorite revelations from the playtests of Sufficiently Advanced: If no one uses a particular system for more than a minute, it's over-designed. The basic conflict system was the case in point here - it was just too much of a pain. People would use it for a round or two and then, whether they were winning or not, move straight to using Twists. After the redesign, it works almost identically, but now gameplay flows from normal interaction to conflict and back without any trouble.<br/><br/>It's also pretty clear when something needs change - the majority of the players keep asking <i>you</i> questions rather than answering them for each other. "What type of die do I roll for this?" was always a big one for my players, so it all works on one die type now.<br/><br/>My goal is (almost) always to make the system work the same way it used to, but in a more simplified manner. Same input, same output, streamlined process. If no one uses a particular system, it either needs to be more efficacious in-game, more simplified, or both - or you need to look at whether the game needs it at all. <br/><br/>As for the page-limited suggestion, I can imagine a 5-page version of D&amp;D, but it wouldn't be the same game at all. You'd have to leave out nearly everything, and most of what you left in would be an abbreviation that only meant something to long-time players anyway. (Hmm... I may have to do this...) It's worth shortening things, certainly, but be reasonable with what you want to include.<br/><br/>Also, it disturbs me that Jason Morningstar apparently bakes his steaks. Weirdo.                        </div>

                            Judson, actually I hadn't really got the feedback from you guys yet, but hearing the same things confirmed makes it clear what the problems are. I look forward to hearing more about how your playtest went.<br/><br/>Adam, your description captures exactly what I had been doing in my design - finding problems and adding solutions for them. Along the way, the game ballooned up with extra options, checks on certain possible abuses, etc. Everything I added made sense to me, but clearly the end result just doesn't have the energy and verve that the initial version promised. <br/><br/>Could you elaborate a little about the process you guys used on Verge at Dreamation? Did you start from a core mechanic and work from there, or did you start completely from first principles, making everything up for grabs? And as you progressed, did you just discuss the options or did you do some playtesting of the work in progress on the fly? It sounds like you ended up with great results, so knowing how you went about it would be very helpful.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Eric                        </div>

                            Yeah, Eric, that's my fault.  We played last week and I was supposed to get an AP up and I got profoundly sick that weekend.  I'm just now crawling out of bed.<br/><br/>My advice on paring the game down -- which I agree, it needs -- is to (a) remove your sabotage options, and (b) take a long, hard look at the "asking for help" mechanic.  In our game, it all boiled down to getting help from others, and doing it in such a way that you got your maximum payout (3 dice = 3 acclaim, -1 acclaim for asking) while they had to work hard to get more than one acclaim out of the deal.  More in general, though, identify the core of the game (which I'm assuming is something like "overcoming pulpy challenges with style") and then go through the rules document rule by rule and ask, "how does this rule support overcoming pulpy challenges with style?"  If it supports the core of the game, keep it.  If it doesn't, strike it.  If it supports some other thing that supports the core of the game, revise it (or strike it).                        </div>

                            On Friday night, we just talked about Verge design. Didn't play. I had a few playtest reports and a few things jumped out as not working. I think the real conversation started though when Dave and Jon, who hadn't played the new version, asked me how I handled getting dice. As I tried to explain it, they were getting confused, and they wanted to know how it actually worked out in play. We started drawing pretty abstract network maps and pointing to them and we got dice out and set them up certain ways to create examples. It's as close to actual play as you can get without actually playing. <br/><br/>In that case, we started from a shared understanding of how the board worked and how the dice were supposed to work in terms of rolling, dividing them into signal and noise piles, paying tokens to get more dice, narrating-in more nodes to get more dice, and rerolling noise to improve the signal pool. Those were the fundamental "atoms" of Verge that I didn't want to give up and I pushed back pretty hard when someone would suggest something that would change the game from that essential mix. Everything else was up for grabs.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I wanted to solve was that when people narrated a path from their character across the network to their goal, they tended to only lightly touch any of the nodes between. The connections were tenuous at best and it started to feel whacky like an Illuminati game. I wanted to slow it down. At some point, I came across the idea of letting each player on his turn reach one additional node away from his character, narrating how it worked. This sped up the game by slowing it down, because it reduced a player's options significantly. Given only a couple choices, a player could quickly pick an option. Given only one new element in the fiction, the player would be more likely to narrate the connection to it in the detail it deserved. We spent an hour working through ways to make that work and I scribbled furiously in my notebook.<br/><br/>On Saturday night, I wanted to test those rules. I also wanted to test a tweak to the network-generation (Load) rules based on some AP feedback and some of my own testing. Basically, I wanted to add additional steps to generate more connections between nodes. I had each player add another edge during their 2nd-5th turns and it created the kind of dynamic spaghetti network that I wanted. The tweak worked wonderfully but the playtest raised another set of problems. The "character-ish" stuff I added to Load didn't feel right; they were at the wrong resolution of detail for the game. It felt wrong to give your character a "Red Rimmed Eyes" trait node and felt right to just tell people you were a cybernetic owlbear and stick the additional power points (exclamation points) on the character node itself. <br/><br/>Ben and Joshua had never played Verge nor, I suspect, read any recent version of the rules. They were working from first principles as well as I could explain and defend my design choices on the fly. Jon and Dave had played a couple versions of the rules and understood my design goals pretty well but also had their own agenda about what the game could and should be. I was happy to entertain the wild ideas of all four designers but in the end wanted the game to be something that satisfied <i>me</i>, first and foremost. <br/><br/>Whenever I could present some bit of the old rules that would be useful, I did. A lot of it got worked in. The end result was a game that a player of any older version of Verge would recognize as the same game, yet the new version was vastly superior and more elegant. I need to capture that ruleset on paper and playtest the hell out of it, but I'm already much happier with Verge than I ever have been.<br/><br/>We discussed options, defended them aloud, formulated theories, then tested them with on-the-spot actual play. Sometimes we'd just Calvinball our design ideas with cries of "hold on," "trust me," and "watch this..." This version of Verge is such a dice-fiddly game that showing was a lot easier than telling. <br/><br/>I'm happy to answer more questions about my process and (of course) about Verge itself, but I don't want to hijack your thread. You drive, Eric.                        </div>
