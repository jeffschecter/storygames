Basically it's a very simple, but complete solo RPG. The following are the steps of play.\n<blockquote>1. As a player you have 10 HP in the game - these represent a fictional character.<br/>2. You have a travel distance of 20 kilometers you need to make to complete this game. Roll 1D6 - this is how far you traveled in kilometeres. Record the amount. But if you roll a 1, also a monster encounter occurs - go to step <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>. If no encounter occured, go to step <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>.<br/><br/>3. Roll 1D6 for your character and 1D6 for the monster. If your roll is equal to or higher than the monsters roll, you beat it and can continue to step <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>. If the monsters roll is higher, you lose 1 HP. If you lose all 10 HP, you lose the game and the game ends. Keep rolling until either you or the monster is beaten.<br/><br/>3A: Also there is another player present called a GM. You may describe a fictional account of your attack on the monster and if he feels moved to do so, he may grant you +2 added upon your dice roll. <br/>3B: If you still roll lower than the monster, you keep the +2 until you pass a roll against the monster.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>. If you make it to 20 kilometers, you have won the game! Congrats! Otherwise go back to step <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.</blockquote>\n<br/>The <i>above</i> is an example of a <b>Serial Spine</b>. You can see it takes you all the way right from the start of play, through to the end.<br/><br/>Now we'll contrast that against roughly the same elements, in <b>Lateral Dislocate</b> form\n<blockquote>Chapter 1: Character Generation<br/>Your character has 10 HP.<br/><br/>Chapter 2: Combat<br/>Characters roll 1D6 vs each other, the highest roll wins and the loser loses 1 HP.<br/><br/>Also the GM may grant a character +2 to hit, if it seems warranted.<br/><br/>Chapter 3: Monsters<br/>Monsters have 1 HP each<br/><br/>Chapter 4: Adventures<br/>Adventures are about traveling 20 kilometers. Generally traveling 1D6 kilometers at a time.<br/><br/>Chapter 5: GM advice<br/>About 16% of the time monsters show up<br/></blockquote>\n<br/>You might recognise that the latter example is more like your traditional RPGs layout.<br/><br/>The tricky thing is is that many would argue the second example works, with the word 'works' used in the same sense as one might say the first example works. But I'd describe it as a Lateral Dislocate because all the pieces are disconnected. Sure, you can put them together, alot like lego, but they do not work as is. YET the thing is many gamers can so SEE a connection between each piece from looking at the dislocated pieces (kinda like a flicker fusion), they see a 'working' game right from the get go.<br/><br/>You then try and argue it doesn't work because what do you do after char gen and they'll say well you have an adventure, then you ask how do you do that, well they point at chapter 4 and so on.<br/><br/>It forms a kind of endless cycle where the person who thinks it works keeps seeing connections between the chapters. And in doing so, they are authoring a game just like the first example is - but a game they will insist actually exist there to begin with.<br/><br/>The other thing is the first example, the Serial Spine, shows how mechanics can utterly shape play. The thing with the Lateral Dislocate example, is that essentially it is very much a fiction first amalgamation. That's why alot of people have trouble imagining any rules as structuring their play, and quite rightly as their experience is that the chapter those rules are in might simply get skipped. In a Lateral Dislocate structure, what set of rules comes up next is really up for grabs. So the rules, kinda like a dislocated shoulder, can't really influence much - as soon as rules start controlling the fiction (in a way disliked by the person who chooses the next chapter), the choose of the next chapter makes sure to choose rules that will undermine the effects they didn't like (or choose no rules at all - the classic 'we spent the whole evening roleplaying and didn't roll once' responce or even just long period where the chooser will only let spoken fiction occur and no rule use (mollases play)).<br/><br/>Given all that, yeah, you try and talk about rules deciding play and people instantly think of a Lateral Dislocate structure and then quite rightly think that the rules can't control stuff (since they are so subbordinate to the chooser).<br/><br/>So I thought I'd give a contrasting example of the Serial Spine game - a game which has a mechanical spine that starts from the very start of play and takes you to the very end of play. Some newer RPG's have a mechanical spine extending to a game ending - Escape from tentacle city is one example.<br/><br/>Hopefully that raises some hope in ya'll that mechanics can actually decide the overall structure of play. And that the 'Lateral Dislocate' structure is not the only choice you can make in terms of RPG structural design.<br/><br/>Thank you.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408401/#Comment_408401" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-07T16:43:34+00:00" title="March  7, 2013  4:43PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a nice example you wrote there, Callan.

Let alone able to be the same experience.<br/><br/>As I said, many gamers can't seem to help but see connections between the Lateral Dislocates disparate components and will insist they are there and 'it's playable'. I'm kind of waiting for that insistance to come up, to engage with it.<br/><br/>What generally happens is that with the author of a Lateral Dislocate system their gameplay is rather consistant, and so rather like the serial spine. But when they go on to write a game, they are victims of legacy design and write up a Lateral Dislocate system.<br/><br/>Now I grant that some people upon recieving the game, just by chance, might put together the disparate components into a game that is much like the authors play. But mostly on a 'monkeys might fly out of my butt' principle.<br/><br/>The majority will, if they attempt to get play going, hash together the components in some way that 'seems to make sense' to them. They will then confuse their creation as a game that was already written down in the text (and worse, the text will encourage them to think this is the case). Indeed, some will think it 'makes so much sense' that it's incredibly wonderful - which is a kind of narcisism as they fall in love with their own design and of course it makes intimate sense to their brain, because it is a direct product of their brain! But they attribute it as being the creation of someone else. Which is a bit heartbreaking when you see designers/creative people who deny they are creative, that it's all 'in the game' and spend hours of their leasure time denying such.<br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Or alternatively</span></b>, instead of just laying the boot into Lateral Dislocate systems, I'm also pointing out how a mechanical spine can be set from the begining of play <i>right to the end</i>. And by it you can decide play - it doesn't just turn out however the group plays the game. You can take control as a designer. I think alot of people, used to Dislocate systems, have thrown their hands in the air at the idea of writing something which actually controls play. They've got the idea that nothing they write in a game can affect gameplay unless the GM lets it, so they've given up on the idea. So here's a morale boost in regards to taking control in game design!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408417/#Comment_408417" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-07T19:09:16+00:00" title="March  7, 2013  7:09PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 7, 2013 7:11PM by JDCorley.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree 100% except that I think "game" is fuzzy enough to incorporate both of these approaches.

And I think it's a bit global to say 'this is why RPG's are fun', but maybe it seemed like I was saying a global statement as well. Really, over many, many discussions I have really not encountered many gamers who will state 'what's happening is the players are actually assembling the game, doing design work of their own'. I really haven't - I'm honestly surprised here to hear you state that explicitly. Most seemed to deny such things even as I point at it explictly. Maybe I'm wrong in my observation and they all/99% of them got it over the years - I'd prefer that to be the case, to be honest.<br/><br/>But at the very least, there's a big distinction between someone who explicitly acknowledges that they assemble the game Vs someone who thinks they 'just play the game'. The former I think is entirely viable and hey, have fun doing that! The latter is not viable - you might argue no one falls into that camp. And I'd say I'd like if that were the case.<br/><br/>I still don't really know what "let me tell you about my character" means?<br/><br/><br/>Frozenwastes,<br/><br/>Well, I'd actually describe getting procedure of play from tradition as a bug, not a feature. Yes, they'll use a tradition - which means they'll...play the same way they always do. That's what traditions are. A new game wont actually mean a new game, it'll be the same way they usually play, but with a different setting. Tradition will dominate the structure of play and new rules wont make a difference. Heck, as much as I admire the riddle of steel RPG, I played it once and entirely forgot to introduce players spiritual attributes - I was a prisoner of tradition and nothing stopped me from ignoring one of the main features of the game. One can try and bop me over the head to try and remember it, but that's just enforcing a Serial Spine (use SA's at so and so time, Callan!) without acknowledging it in textual form.<br/><br/><br/>Dreamofpeace,<br/><br/>Well the SS version doesn't even mention 'adventure', I'll grant. You just...play.<br/><br/>Otherwise I'm kind of being very generous to your traditional LD game, in that the 'adventure' section for a trad RPG is far more ambiguous than what I've described. Indeed, what traditional games even have an 'adventure' section? Yet what are alot of traditional RPG's about? Adventure! My examples might be bad in that I give more advice on how to actually have an adventure in the LD adventure game than a traditional RPG adventure game gives on how to have an adventure!<br/><br/>You know, I am kinda coming up a blank - really most trad RPG's just don't have a section on how to run an adventure. Or atleast from my memory they don't. Even as they are about adventure, or so they say. Maybe an example will pop to mind for someone else?<br/><br/>Anyway, in as much as I say the LD example doesn't actually do anything, I'd agree the adventure section/the 20k doesn't do the same thing as the SS 20k does. In the LD example the 20k just sits there, spinning in semantic space unless someone assembles it into the game they are playing as they build it.<br/><br/>Myself, I think your question has highlighted another large hole in trad RPG's - if were doing adventures, how do we do that? Dunno.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408446/#Comment_408446" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-08T01:44:14+00:00" title="March  8, 2013  1:44AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2013 1:45AM by Rickard.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I like the contrasting examples very much.

Something most (traditional) roleplaying games lack is telling how to play the game. How a game session should be played out. That's the important part of roleplaying games.<br/><br/>When looking at other forms of games, like board games and card games, you got clear (and short) structures for how to play the game from start to end. In other words, board- and card games got a spinal structure. They sometimes got optional rules for changing how to play the game. Note however that rules are procedural structures, but structures doesn't have to be game mechanics. Following a list of structures isn't really considered game mechanics, but just as rules, it's still something you need to follow.<br/><br/>In my first published game, I wanted to provide a game style. The GM advice in my book are the heart of the game, and the rules supported those advices. What happened was that only a few people read the advice, because they brought their own conventions on how to play roleplaying games into their reading. They didn't think they needed to read about how to play the game. So I got complaints that some of the game mechanics didn't work, because they used their own conventions.<br/><br/>So I experimented and released another version of the game. It didn't have the traditional chapters. It just had Conventions, Character Creation and Adventure Creation. The Convention chapter had rules in it but it was a subdued by the text on how you should think to play the game. I got complaints that I had to many conventions, and one person even suggested me checking up AW to see how the writer could manage with fewer conventions. I did that, and I discovered that AW had as many conventions as my game.<br/><br/>This made me think. People seem to be better at taking in rules than GM advice. In my fourth game, I still wanted to provide a game style. Rules however, are nothing more than structures, so I tried writing the whole game as a structure. A sequence of play that instructs people how to play my game. I don't know how it will turn out, because I haven't published it yet. It's something I'm looking forward to find out.<br/><br/>So you should think in structures if you want to write a game, but most of all, describe the whole sequence of play and nothing more than that. Doing this is actually a form of "show, don't tell".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408461/#Comment_408461" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-08T06:32:49+00:00" title="March  8, 2013  6:32AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But at the very least, there's a big distinction between someone who explicitly acknowledges that they assemble the game Vs someone who thinks they 'just play the game'.

Maybe in your area everyone acknowledges they assemble a game from a lateral dislocate structure?\n<blockquote>This is just ludicrous. Virtually all RPGs have extensive things to say on how to design adventures/scenarios. </blockquote>\nAh ha, contention!<br/><br/>Okay, now really in regards to my SS example, do any of them actually give an explicit number that leads to the end of the game, as well as a count method to get there (and a series of steps to follow in a loop till you do)?<br/><br/>Or even in my LD example, do they even just have an explicit number and a notion of rolling a D6 to get toward it or something?<br/><br/>I would agree virtually all RPG's waffle on about stuff. But no, I'd say it's actually ludicrous to say that all RPG's tell you how to go from the start of play to the end of the game.<br/><br/>It sounds just like the 'I just play the game' illusion - except here it's 'I just follow the adventure designing advice' rather than admitting such advice has little to no influence on the adventure you design. As much as the Lateral Dislocate structure has little to no influence on which chapter you will enact. The advice is also in Lateral Dislocate structure - like a buffet, just pick and choose what you listen to, if any. And picking and choosing is fine, unless one also says 'oh, I just follow the advice', which isn't true if you pick and choose.<br/><br/>I'm trying to think of an example where 'advice' could definately change adventure design, but that 'advice' could not just be called a rule. But I can't really think that's even possible? Do you have some examples of where adventure design advice stopped you from doing something/genuinely affected adventure design, but at the same time was still just advice and not a rule?<br/><br/><br/>CarpeGuitarrem,\n<blockquote>I think the concept you're looking for is the existence of an implicit narrative arc built into the game. The less of an implicit narrative arc there is, the more of a toolkit the game is, and the more it tends towards Lateral Dislocation. </blockquote>\nWell, one might even say: the more implicit that implicit narrative arc becomes, the more of a toolkit the game is.<br/><br/>Ie, I'd kind of describe the implicitness as a problem.<br/><br/>I don't argue that some RPG's probably rest on an implicit arc - the other day I was actually forming a post in my head about conflict resolution in relation to something like that.<br/><br/>But I don't really see any RPG's just admit that explicitly in their text. It becomes too implicit. And because of that 'can't bear to say it' issue, it risks going from implicit to dissapearing entirely, the whole thing collapsing into Lateral Dislocate. I think Ron Edwards is probably in favour of the implicit narrative arc.

Within the context of the second type of game, this is exactly, <i>exactly</i> what must be done and which makes the second type of game fun to play.<br/><br/>Also, that advice has overwhelming influence on the adventure you design.  You will never convince me otherwise without a peer-reviewed statistical enterprise that carefully analyzed gaming groups and compared the adventures designed to the advice about how to design it.\n<blockquote>Do you have some examples of where adventure design advice stopped you from doing something/genuinely affected adventure design, but at the same time was still just advice and not a rule?</blockquote>\nYes, I was grouchily looking at D&amp;D3 for a Birthright-a-like game but running into all kinds of problems with social situations and ruling situations.  Then I read the first three paragraphs of the introduction where it reminded me that the game was about adventure and the job of the GM is to present challenges. That structure helped me toss some of the shit the game was not going to mechanically support and what was left was much stronger. In fact I found myself wishing I'd read it earlier. The advice would have solved a shitload of the problems I had with D&amp;D3.<br/><br/>Also, did you not see my huge "how to play Vampire 1ed" thread where everyone was shocked to learn that if the GMs had actually followed what the book said to do that most of their problems would not have occurred?  Or is this evidence that advice doesn't actually do anything?<br/><br/>I would put this question back to you: Imagine D&amp;D3, printed as-is but with all DM instructions removed.

However, as JDCorley points out, that the lack of prescription not actually be as true as we think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace" title="Dreamofpeace"><img alt="Dreamofpeace" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/262/nTKQSP3YRT3C1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamofpeace">Dreamofpeace</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408538/#Comment_408538" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-08T19:23:18+00:00" title="March  8, 2013  7:23PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK I went and wrote a quick game: <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9Pwq-FbdThtM0ViRUpnSWZTcFk/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9Pwq-FbdThtM0ViRUpnSWZTcFk/edit?usp=sharing</a>.

It doesn't matter if it's a structure for how to frame scenes, on how to write your background, on how to create twists in the story or just how the characters are introduced.<br/><br/>I can only think of two ways to deliver a structure: by a check list that you must go through (aka "procedures"), or by presenting a list that you must pick something of. I guess the sequence of play is nothing more that a structure on how to deliver structures. I've just read <a href="http://kagematsu.wordpress.com/kagematsu-rules/" rel="nofollow">Kagematsu</a> and that game got a structure each for courtship, confrontation and conclusion, and they are all sorted into a sequence of play.<br/><br/>Sequence of play can also have structures that are looped or repeated. When you play AW and using moves, for example, the moves have the same structure. You don't really need to roll dice, all you need is to understand what makes a good situation.<br/><i><br/>[edit, changed]</i><br/>Declare your intent. Pick one below.<br/>- the GM activates a counter-move.<br/>- you will succeed but with a twist. Either by partly succeeding or the GM activates a counter-move.<br/>- achieve your intent.<br/><i>[/edit]</i><br/><br/>These moves (structures) are looped over and over again through the session. But like I said before, you can do this with all kinds of structures, not just game mechanics. Framing scenes is the most obvious example.<br/><br/>(I normally don't like talking about rules, because that locks your mindset. I rather talk about structures.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408566/#Comment_408566" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-09T12:45:52+00:00" title="March  9, 2013 12:45PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2013 1:59PM by Callan_S.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>OK I went and wrote a quick game: <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9Pwq-FbdThtM0ViRUpnSWZTcFk/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9Pwq-FbdThtM0ViRUpnSWZTcFk/edit?usp=sharing</a>.

Though it's interesting when someone with Edwards notion of story brain damage comes in contact with it (in a sort of car wreck sense). However, if the game designer has some weird story structure in mind for his game but does not put in a SS that supports that, then folk will just put in vanilla, regular old beginning, middle and end instead of that strange structure. As author you can't think 'Memento' and then expect people will just use that sort of story structure unless you <i>enforce</i> that.</blockquote>\nOh, they definitely do. They absolutely have a structure encoded into the rules, and it makes the game very worthwhile.<br/><br/>Fiasco has a very strict structure--you start by making a <b>Setup</b> of characters in a volatile situation, play through <b>Act I</b> to entrench them in schemes, determine a <b>Tilt</b> that will shake everything up, play through <b>Act II</b> to bring everything to a head, and finally wind things down with the <b>Aftermath</b>, where characters' stories are unwound. All of those elements are explicitly required by the game. Scene resolution, too.<br/><br/>Misspent Youth has a particular structure too: it's a progression of 7 specific scenes, each of which represents a different piece of the session's story arc. What each scene does (from Scene 1 to Scene 7) is specified in the rules, and each scene has a different specific role. They send the characters through an arc where things build, get really bad, and the characters ultimately get a shot at finally confronting the villains. That happens every session.<br/><br/>Hollowpoint's structure is laid out as "Conflict, Conflict, Conflict" to achieve an initial objective, followed by another chain of Conflicts to achieve a secondary objective. It's a bit looser than the others, but there's still a spine there. There's also a very particular (but more organic) arc to it, by means of the economy of characters. When an Agent (one of the hyper-professionals attempting a mission) dies, or is otherwise removed from the game, and incorporates a complication that they prepared ahead of time (something designed to bring them into conflict with the mission objective), then they get to come in at the next level, as an Operative. They are considered to have "won the game" for that session. If they do that again as an Operative, they get to come in as a Handler. If they do it again as a Handler, they are considered to have "totally won", and the game is over. (It's actually a really elegantly-designed game, if you play it as intended. It's an engine built for a particular purpose.)<br/><br/>I don't actually own My Life With Master, but from what I hear, it enforces a general plot arc where characters (evil minions) fail and fail again to defy their master's will, until eventually one of them snaps and goes to kill the master. Then the game ends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408658/#Comment_408658" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-10T13:13:01+00:00" title="March 10, 2013  1:13PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan: what's missing in your second game has nothing to do with the structure.  Let me rewrite your two games to illustrate:<br/><br/>Game 3 (rules of game 2, structure of game 1):<br/><br/>1) Your character has 10 HP.<br/>2) Generally, roll 1d6 and travel that many kilometers.  <br/>3) About 16% of the time monsters show up, each of which has 1 HP.  If one does go to step 4, if not, go to step 5<br/>4) If your character and a monster fight each rolls 1d6.  Whoever rolls higher wins.  The loser loses 1 HP.  Also the GM may grant a character +2 to hit, if it seems warranted.<br/>5) If you traveled a total of 20 kilometers, the adventure is complete.  If not, go back to step 2.<br/><br/><br/>Game 4 (rules of game 1, structure of game 2):<br/><br/>Chapter 1: Character Generation<br/>You have a fictional character represented by 10 HP.<br/><br/>Chapter 2: Combat<br/>When your character fights a monster, each rolls 1D6 vs each other.  If your roll is equal to or higher than the monsters roll, you beat it and can continue.  If the monsters roll is higher, you lose 1 HP. If you lose all 10 HP, you lose the game and the game ends. Keep rolling until either you or the monster is beaten.  You may describe a fictional account of your attack on the monster.<br/><br/>Chapter 3: Monsters<br/>Whenever you travel 1km at a time a monster appears and fights you.<br/><br/>Chapter 4: Movement<br/>Roll 1D6 - this is how far you traveled in kilometeres. Record the amount.  <br/><br/>Chapter 5: Adventures<br/>You have a travel distance of 20 kilometers you need to make to complete this game. If you make it to 20km, you win.<br/><br/>Chapter 6: GM advice<br/>If you (the GM) feel moved to do so, you may grant the player +2 added upon your dice roll.  If the player still doesn't beat the monster, he continues to use the +2 bonus until the monster is defeated.<br/><br/><br/>Notice that game 3 is incomplete (how do you know when monsters show up?  do they always attack?) even though it's presented as procedure, while game 4 is complete, even though it's disjointed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408694/#Comment_408694" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-10T21:48:44+00:00" title="March 10, 2013  9:48PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2013 9:52PM by Callan_S.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Timonkey</b>,<br/><br/>Game 4 isn't complete.

I'll limit myself to Solar System as its the one I've read and played the most recently.<br/><br/>In Solar System, you come up with a setting at the table with a group, then you drill down to focal points, come up with what types characters are appropriate, then you start making them.  You open up with a heroic scene or iconic vision of the character that communicates the most important thing about her.  Then talk about what got her to that place.  And so on, generating the stats as you go.  Then you carry on into secrets and Keys.<br/><br/>The Story Guide then has a set procedure of doing an introductory scene for each character and from then on, you are on a circuit of play you pretty much never leave.  The text even has a flow chart for you to use.  When conflict comes up you also a have a step by step procedure, including escalating into extended conflict, changing stakes midstream and exiting into narration and then you're back in another box on the flow chart (either refreshment or consequences).\n<blockquote>In other words, how do you feel about a game which, mechanically, is just like the loose, vague, structureless design you're describing here, but is really, really good at telling you how and when to use all those parts in play?</blockquote>\nI could see it being taken that way.  I didn't see what Eero wrote as being some suggestions that you might follow maybe, but talking about the actual procedures you go through at the table.

The difference is that the various rules and procedures can be triggered and/or applied in lots of different ways. The art of playing the game is largely in deciding when--for example--you call for an Ability Check. Whereas in a "serial spine" game, there's always an unambiguous next step (like in Fiasco).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes" title="frozenwastes"><img alt="frozenwastes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/062/nIVJF3PC5XJ0G.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frozenwastes">frozenwastes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408702/#Comment_408702" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-10T23:22:45+00:00" title="March 10, 2013 11:22PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get what you're saying now.

Probably.  I've been considering doing a 1 page D&amp;D hack, where the DM rules are a flowchart.  But it's hard to present a complex game with all the rules in the order you use them.  Even board games don't do that most of the time.  I just got Thunderbolt Apache Leader, and that actually does have all the rules in order (actually, when they first become relevant, sometimes you have to go backwards to reread some details that didn't have quite enough context yet for their implications to be clear) but that's a one player game and not the norm.  For most games I think this would be awkward, because the step where you pick weapons for your aircraft takes several pages, because it has to explain all the weapons.<br/><br/>Mouse Guard seems a relevant RPG text.  I remember it doing a good job of presenting the flow of play in layers, first in an overview of overall play, then going into detail on each section (e.g. Players Turn, GM's Turn), while also pointing to where the details are for each step.  I think this represents a good balance between extremes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408734/#Comment_408734" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T09:56:15+00:00" title="March 11, 2013  9:56AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan,<br/>  I just went through a bunch of old Game books (BESM 1st Ed, DC Heroes 3rd ed, TSR Conan (1985), Macho Women with Guns 1st Ed.). Except for BESM, there were clear instructions on how to create an adventure. I will admit, I like games with good instructions, so those survived my collections after my many moves.<br/>  I do feel like even the worst written RPGs are a "game." "Game" is such a broad term that you have to really stretch to say something is not a game.<br/>  As to writing style, I have to say, any effort to improve the writing of RPG rule books. This looks like a great post describing a broken writing style. Too many times an author makes assumptions about the readers understanding, traditions or what was actually conveyed tot he reader. This example is something that any RPG designer can benefit from, thanks!<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408745/#Comment_408745" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-11T12:14:28+00:00" title="March 11, 2013 12:14PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another interesting side thought: this also seems like the difference between procedural and object-oriented programming.

I think that even the most strongly worded rules requirements can and will be disregarded by GMs.<br/>  I feel like part of the issue with writing these sorts of provisions is that there are large quantities of game play that are unknown to the designer. Which characters are in play, what the NPCs look/act like are entirely customizable. And "Story Game" phenomenon makes such writing even more difficult. For instance take a game like Solar System, where the characters and antagonists are completely unknown. But when the game designer can't make any assumptions about the PC, NPCs, setting or consequences of actions (like in PTA), it creates a challenge to write verbiage that clarifies the story arc/progression in a manner that is not confusing when used in actual play.<br/>You can write for that, but it requires a significant amount of wordsmithing. Ultimately, it is an effort that pays off though.<br/><br/>  As far as judging the quality of a design by what it does not allow, that just seems as broken as judging a design by what dice you need to play it. Sure, it is a factor, but it is not a good gauge of quality. Say yes or roll the dice is a good example of this. It forbids the GM from saying "No." While this was a novel concept at the time, this rule if taken too literally could ruin that game as much as when it is ignored.<br/><br/>  This is a great discussion though, thanks for starting this thread.<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408836/#Comment_408836" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-12T11:50:02+00:00" title="March 12, 2013 11:50AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Timonkey,<br/><br/>I think in game 4 there's more than one interpretive option a person might guess in regard to when to roll 1D6 (if at all), which leads to something other than game 1 being played (remember, you have the benefit of having game 1 in front of you. They wouldn't). I think if you sat the text down in front of a hundred groups, many of them might make entirely different guesses about what to do.

That initial execution code is embodied by the will of the GM.<br/><br/>I mainly came to the comparison because your "Serial Spine" example is effectively procedural programming, to the point that I could one-on-one translate the words to pseudocode. (Though I think that your version of the Lateral Dislocate is rather unfair to it. Lateral Dislocate games aren't made by chopping up and boiling down a Serial Spine game, they follow an entirely different mindset. When I have time, I'll post what I consider to be a more fair example of a Lateral Dislocate game that covers the same ground as your example.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408866/#Comment_408866" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-12T18:10:51+00:00" title="March 12, 2013  6:10PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan:  I thought Mcdaldno's fix to game 4 was sufficient, but can you see that we at least <i>could</i> make it complete?<br/><br/>Although, your comment about your "Lateral Dislocate" being like object-oriented programming without calling the object makes me think that by LD you mean game text that is both disjointed and incomplete.

My point is that a text can be disjointed but not incomplete.<br/><br/>Actually, I now think that disjointed is even a bad term for it, as it implies incoherent.  That need not be the case.  Breaking up the game into pieces allows you to learn parts of it at a time, and understand the whole much earlier.

He calls it the Archipelago and the River Delta metaphor. Archipelago play (as distinct from playing Matthijs' Archipelago specifically) deals with navigating through the ocean of free play, and touching down on mechanics when the mood and moment are right. Hopping from island to island, there are a plethora of rules that can be invoked, and they are (when things are working correctly) when it is both right and desired. There's a huge amount of room for Rule Zero here. It's raised event to an aesthetic philosophy, which may be how it was intended all the time (but can be used to cover a world of errors). A River Delta game is one where the rules focus your play like the river banks do. You are not left to wonder where you should be headed, the rules hand you off from free play in the water to the next set of procedures. <br/><br/>Now the River Delta is likely to be very dependable. You're less liable to get lost, or hit uncharted rocks in the water. But it's a completely different experience, and may be suited to different skills. Playing a primarily free-play game you are susceptible to the storms of player discontent, or may let you be beached on the shoals of GM burnout. The River Delta makes it much easier for anyone to pick up the role of GM/navigator. And this kind of structure is well suited to more distributed, multi-GM play. If there is not just one hand at the wheel, then having rules for how the many hands work together makes sense. </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408958/#Comment_408958" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-13T16:56:28+00:00" title="March 13, 2013  4:56PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2013 6:40PM by Callan_S.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Timonkey,<br/><br/>If chapter 4 of your disjointed game included the text 'This is how you start play: ' before the rest of the text in that chapter, I'd agree on the disjointed notion. I wouldn't see much point in having it that way, but I would agree on it just being disjointed. Currently though the disjointedness seems a distraction for how it also does not describe a certain piece of procedure.<br/><br/><br/>Paul,<br/><br/>Without being held to particulars of the analogy, yeah, River Delta = Serial Spine, Archipelago = Lateral Dislocate. Note: Though Emily might be refering to something like CarpeGuitarrem was with the River Delta idea, where there isn't an explicit spine and the game instead hangs off an implicit story structure (ie, the user has a notion of begining, middle and end). In which case see my conversations with CarpeGuitarrem - I wouldn't say that is serial spine, but its kinda like a close relative.<br/><br/>I think it doesn't go into the details of how Achipelago/Lateral Dislocate's enaction of rules can simply cancel each other out (eg, GM chooses the fight 'island'. but right after he chooses the resting 'island', which then negates any mechanical effect the fight has...making the fight a pointless time waster if you're not just interested in a reenactment/simulationist experience), but I guess that would have complicated the distinction.

The players know this, and it influences play of their characters, but the decision the player makes in Apocalypse World is about what happens in the fiction, it's not about whether or not to use mechanics (let's ignore custom moves for now).

From the sound of it, the players speak fiction and the GM, upon hearing it, may be moved to activate one of the AW moves. The pivotal issue is whether players just mechanically choose their move, or have to speak fiction that they hope fits/moves the GM to choose the move they wanted to activate. What I say applies to the latter. I'm not sure I understand you fully, but you seem to ignore the subjective element involved when you say 'Unlike some other games, once the fiction is set, there is no choice of mechanics.'. As some people like to cry out, were not robots - even if the mechanic to use after hearing the fiction seems obvious, it's the result of ones brain evaluating a series of ambiguous elements (we don't evaluate things like a robot) <i>subjectively</i>.<br/><br/>Really it's alot like how in the past people thought the sun revolved around the earth - because it just appears to! It might seem what mechanic is used next revolves around the fiction, but actually what mechanic is used next revolves around the GM. <br/><br/>Though there are other mechanics (like the player chooses the mechanic after they give some fiction that ties to it, for example), so maybe another type of mechanic is used in AW?<br/><br/><br/>2097, as far as I understand you, absolutely yes! Yes, you're actually bombarded with dozens or even hundreds of options, when it comes to even the first step of your hex crawl world. There's actually a perverse perceptivity/difficulty curve involved - the more you're aware of all the options, the harder it is to piece something together. While if ones perception can't actually see as many of the options and only sees a handful (or only one, even!!), it becomes easy to piece together (though along with it, far more rigid).<br/><br/>I think you're at the high perception and with it high difficulty end of the curve where you can see a vast range of options - don't let others say 'it's easy'. It's really not a fair comparison between you and them. When they can see far fewer options, of course it's easier to choose from those options.<br/><br/>I'm mostly saying that because I sense a workload on you and a sense that you think there's some extra trick to it you're pursuing and I want to ease the former and dispell the latter.<br/><br/>And I love how you say 'often contrasting methods' - you're far more diplomatic than I am!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409321/#Comment_409321" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-17T05:45:36+00:00" title="March 17, 2013  5:45AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote cite="Callan S">a sense that you think there's some extra trick to it you're pursuing</blockquote>\nWell, yes, but the trick that I\u2019m pursuing is to try to rewrite their declarative (\u201cLateral Dislocate\u201d) descriptions into a prodecural (\u201cSerial Spine\u201d) style. So that I have a checklist (\u201cdecide biotopes per hex using this-or-that method, draw borders surrounding regions of so-and-so\u2013many hexes\u2026\u201d) that I then can follow everytime I want to start a new sandbox. Coming from programming, there are also other approaches to try (OO, functional\u2026)<br/><br/>I think it is a good thing if game designers write their games in a procedural/Serial Spine style.<br/><br/>Sometimes rewriting declarative/LD games into a procedural style can show just how overwhelming a game is.<br/>Have you seen this?<br/><a href="http://free.7host07.com/spdesign/files%5CCombat_Chart_bicolored.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://free.7host07.com/spdesign/files\\Combat_Chart_bicolored.pdf</a><br/>It\u2019s a rewrite of GURPS 4e combat (just combat) into procedural style.<br/><br/>A good case could be made that the declarative/Lateral Dislocate style would be easier to approach. You start with a simple core, and then as you gain profeciency with the rules you add in subsystems. \u201cHmm, we use automatic fire\u2026 let\u2019s look it up\u2026 ok, it works like this-or-that\u201d.

It has the information but it\u2019s distributed in an encyclopedic test that I need to gather clues from about how to play.<br/><br/><br/>Sometimes a rewrite to a procedural style shows that huge swaths of the game is either missing, or specific to a style that\u2019s been hard for me to pull off well. I agree completely with you that what is commonly called \u201cadventure design\u201d is either missing completely (as in, for example, McWoD) or, in say Trail of Cthulhu, a collection of setpieces and combat/clue-gathering encounters that reveals a playstyle that is less \u201cplay to find out what happens\u201d and more \u201clet the players reveal what the GM has planned\u201d that I would personally like.

Here I'm not talking about MC/GM moves, I'm talking about player moves.  Let's look at a Dungeon World Move (because they're more in plain english):<br/><br/>Defend<br/>When you stand in defense of a person, item, or location under attack, [mechanics].<br/><br/>The players control their characters and the GM everything else.  Once the GM establishes that there is an Ogre about to stomp on a child, and then a player decides to move their character between them to defend the child, the Defend move kicks in.  The situation is as outlined in the Move, so it kicks in.<br/><br/>I've read through your Mechanical Tea &amp; Sympathy thread, and I disagree with most of what you said there (and also admit to understanding almost none of it until someone else recapitulated it) .  I've seen the "mother may I" situation in dysfunctional D&amp;D3 play (e.g. why won't you just let me roll Diplomacy?), but that isn't going to happen in all games.  You talked about the GM having the final say about what's in the fiction, but why and how?  Are you saying that in the situation above the GM can just say, "no, you don't move to protect the child"?<br/><br/>Also, something that might be causing a disconnect: when I say fiction with regards to RPGs, I really mean is shared imagined space (which I've seen written as SIS), which is the set of imagined events that exists in all of the players' minds (including the GM).  If it hasn't been properly articulated, it doesn't count, and needs to be cleared up, but this is an issue of communication and not one that requires additional layers of authority.  We already have rules about who has authority to contribute in what ways to the fiction/shared imagined space.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409351/#Comment_409351" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-17T13:12:06+00:00" title="March 17, 2013  1:12PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "You can't move to protect the child, you're too far away"<br/>"You can't move to protect the child, you're an insubstantial ghost."<br/>"You can't move to protect the child, you have the Immobilized condition on you."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409359/#Comment_409359" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-17T14:25:31+00:00" title="March 17, 2013  2:25PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Sometimes rewriting declarative/LD games into a procedural style can show just how overwhelming a game is.<br/>Have you seen this?<br/><a href="http://free.7host07.com/spdesign/files%5CCombat_Chart_bicolored.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://free.7host07.com/spdesign/files\\Combat_Chart_bicolored.pdf</a><br/>It\u2019s a rewrite of GURPS 4e combat (just combat) into procedural style.<br/></blockquote>\nThat overwhelmingness is why "LD" games exist, though.

How proceduralized the text is can affect how long it takes me to wrap my head around a game, but in general I'm always going to want to have a full command of the step-by-step part and the Big Picture overview. Only having one or the other just doesn't cut it.<br/><br/>(I will say that in games with a lot of moving parts, I seem to get to that level of understanding faster when the book is giving me the less-proceduralized approach and I'm the one working out the step-by-step instructions, rather than the other way around.

This is the same sort of reception the Lumpley principle got - people said 'well, maybe in some (bad) games, but in mine we just go and do X and Y in the fiction'. Mother may I is in every single session of roleplay you've ever played. When it gets to a subtle, sympathetic level, it becomes almost invisible, to the extent you think it only exists in 'why won't you just let me roll Diplomacy?' examples. No, that's just where MMI becomes more visible.<br/><br/>The issue is, you can't see the subjective evaluation occuring. \n<blockquote>Once the GM establishes that there is an Ogre about to stomp on a child, and then a player decides to move their character between them to defend the child, the Defend move kicks in.</blockquote>\nI mean, this isn't an example of play at all. Who at the table says 'and then a player decides to move'??? It's not that way at all - you give a single narrative of the event (where of course you don't say anything to contradict yourself in the narrative). When you have more than one narrative/person, contradictions easily come up. It's several people at the table, and several narratives (ie, individual RL lives) going on.<br/><br/>If you could give the example with what each person actually says (what the GM says, what the player says) then we get closer to the subjective evaluation that occurs (by someone at the table).<br/><br/>Right now it's you who are saying the character was <b>definately</b> moved to defend the child. Right now were simply working with your single narrative and as much as you're not going to contradict yourself, your narrative makes sense. But when we work with two narratives (because as Ralph of universalis says, there is no SIS, just a series of seperate imagined spaces/narratives), it's not so simple.<br/><br/>I thought this would hook conversation over, almost off topic - but at the same time it's intimately tied with it's sister thread (Mechanical Tea and GM sympathy)<br/><br/><br/>CarpeGuitarrem, <br/>No one understands the very procedural game of chess?<br/><br/><br/>TildeSee,\n<blockquote>the GM is not the final arbiter on the fiction or the moves triggered by it; it is the GM's job to make suite the fiction is clear to everyone; when the fiction is not clear to everyone, ask questions to clarify the situation. <br/></blockquote>\nYou have real people at the table - and real people don't always agree/they argue. Repeatedly going into extra detail on the fiction wont matter if the other person remains unconvinced.<br/><br/>I know the classic gamer responce is that no one at the table is going to think in a contradictory way to anyone else ('they just need a bit more fiction cleared up, that is all...'), or anyone who does must only do so to be a douche or something. The echo chamber answer.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm the odd one out (though Ron Edwards seems to be a contradictory thinker) and roleplay from the start has been all about play where no one lets themselves remain unconvinced. Or maybe roleplay culture is different in Australia. Just that pretty much everyone one I've gamed with or even <i>ever met</i> tend to have their own strident thoughts. I can't imagine them quashing them out side of play, let alone inside of play just to 'keep the game going'. They are the values that matter to them - matter more than a game. And so there's a need for a final say (which means they don't have to quash them or agree, they just have to accept the final says declaration on what were doing next in play).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409384/#Comment_409384" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-17T18:09:55+00:00" title="March 17, 2013  6:09PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I understand shared imagined space (SIS) in terms of set theory.  It's the set of imagined stuff (regarding the game at hand) which is common to all players.  That certainly exists, it's just hard to say exactly what it is, because we can't read all the players' minds.  However, sometimes when someone contributes something that doesn't make sense to another player, because it doesn't fit with what they've imagined, it becomes obvious that the SIS isn't complete enough for play to continue.  At that point, players need to basically rewind a little bit to build up the SIS appropriately.  <br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>GM: An Ogre comes into the room and looks to be about to stomp on a child.<br/>Player (Chris): I move to protect him.<br/>GM: You can't move to protect the child, you're too far away.<br/>Chris: What?

Sure, some chess players are all about memorizing sequences of moves so that they can counter X with Y, because they've seen a position before...but actual chess tactics rely on an understanding of the role played by each piece, of the purpose of controlling space and setting up offenses (and defenses), of learning a few simple combinations and how to apply them.<br/><br/>In fact, you could only play chess 100% procedurally if you had the ability of a computer to retrieve chess positions from historical games (or to look ahead therein). Learning what a fork is, or a discovered check, or understanding why a zugzwang happens, those are pieces of the art of chess, and that's exactly how Lateral Dislocate works. You learn pieces, and then you figure out how to stitch them together through experience.<br/><br/>It takes baby steps, but eventually you figure out how to look at a situation and recognize that Tool X which you've learned how to use is perfect, or maybe Tool Y is the right one because it'll set you up in the long run. But that's the actual art of chess. In fact, I'd argue that chess is deceptively non-procedural.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409401/#Comment_409401" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-17T22:20:08+00:00" title="March 17, 2013 10:20PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree - maybe really early when you're still learning the game and really don't understand what the pieces do, just how they move and what the goal of the game is, maybe that's procedural since you can't really look ahead significantly, but overwhelmingly, even in memorized openings, chessplayers don't play procedurally (since deciding what opening line you want to try to get into and what the risks and benefit of each are is not procedural knowledge.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409408/#Comment_409408" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-17T23:51:56+00:00" title="March 17, 2013 11:51PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2013 12:14AM by 2097.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Timonkey suggested that. I don't think I agree - I think the main issue in that gurps flow chart you wrote that if you have four players, then you are going to be going through that flowchart four times, at the same time!!!</blockquote>\nSequentially, not at the same time. One issue is that this whole four-page chart is supposed to represent one players\u2019 turn, and once you\u2019ve gone around the table, including for the monsters, <i>one second</i> has passed in the game world.<br/>Whereas if you start from the core of \u201c3d6 must be rolled under the attackers skill, 3d6 over the passive defense, and Xd6+Y must be calculated as damage (vs armor, hitpoints etc)\u201d (if you have three different styles of d6 you can roll them all together) it can very well take just a few seconds in gaming time and is better suited to represent one second in the game world. Then if someone has comprehensive Lateral Dislocate knowledge, they might say things like \u201cOh, my Karate guy can do this special Frobnicate Xyzzy here\u201d and do it.<br/>But I\u2019m with you. The declarative/LD style is hard to learn and a nagging feeling that \u201cI\u2019m missing something\u201d will never leave unless I go through a procedural rewrite.<br/>My original point by linking to this GURPS chart was to show how a declarative style might look simple in the eyes of the game writers, but when converted to a concrete method of play, ether explicitly through a rewrite like this, or implicitly through player comprehension / learning of the game\u2019s rules, become extremely complex.\n<blockquote>Also it doesn't seem comprehensive - check if the sides detect each other? How?</blockquote>\nYes, many parts of the chart reference other parts of GURPS.<br/>\n<blockquote>That overwhelmingness is why "LD" games exist, though. Here's where the procedural vs. object-oriented programming analogy really shines. If you rewrote every bit of software on the market as a procedural program, it would be ludicrous. And that's because humans don't understand things on a procedural basis. We understand things as an abstract collection of objects (with characteristics) that interact with one another, forming specific connections.<br/><br/>Procedural writing is just a way that organizes things for us, but only as a means to understanding the objects intuitively.</blockquote>\nCarpeGuitarrem, it\u2019s clear that you get what I mean, but let\u2019s go a bit further.<br/>As a <i>writer</i>, the procedural style is horrible. I never program that way. I dig the functional style but for some domains declarative works better for me.<br/><br/>But in order for a <i>processor</i> to use the program, it needs to either be compiled into procedural form (opcodes in machine language or a bytecode middle step) or it needs to be interpreted by an interpreter that knows how to follow the instructions of the language.<br/>In the analogy,<br/>in order for a <i>player</i> to use the game, it needs to be either restated into procedural form (through explicit rewrites/flowcharts, or internalized and organized in the brain) or the game text needs to be followed by someone who is through tradition very familiar with how to work with that type of rules text.<br/><br/>And, just like how profiling a compiled and running process can reveal problems in the underlying code, regardless of language paradigm, a restatement of the LD/declarative style language into the procedural form can reveal issues of complexity or holes.<br/><br/>Many humans are \u201cprocessors\u201d rather than writers. Have you noticed, for example, that Wikipedia is great with its declarative style, but \u201cquestion-asking sites\u201d have popped up in the thousands because they\u2019re easier to understand?<br/><br/>Callan\u2019s example in the OP rang very true for me. In the declarative example we had stuff like \u201cmonsters appear 16% of the time\u201d. Huh? I get, as a seasoned gamer, that there are many methods I can use to determine a 16% chance (doubles on 2d6, percentile dice, 11+ on d12 etc), but it\u2019s not clear WHEN to use those methods. If, say, my parents would read a rule like that, they\u2019d have no idea what to do with it. In the procedural example, on the other hand, we had clear instructions on what triggered a monster appearance. Bliss!<br/><br/><br/><br/>(Now this next bit is fairly off-topic to the subject of procedural vs declarative.)\n<blockquote> gold=xp</blockquote>\nWe do the same. We explore a huge dungeon that the DM has bought in a book, we have gold=xp to drive the story and we scout out various areas of this dungeon. At any given time it feels like we have plenty of options.

Exactly my feelings on it!<br/><br/><br/>CarpeGuitarrem,<br/><br/>It's a curious perspective you take - but it appears 2097 is taking it too? Granted my first example of a serial spine is very simple, but I'm not sure why you treat serial rule sequences as serial gameplay?<br/><br/>A serial sequence can offer you 100 choices. Sequentially you can go onto one of the choices which, lets say, offers another 100 choices. Sequentially going onto one of these offers a further 100 choices.<br/><br/>That's serial spine. That's how chess is played - every piece offers choices (lots of choices - not sure how many, on each of your (serial) turns, fewer choices as you lose pieces). Everyone plays chess in a serial spine manner. Not everyone chooses the same choices that the serial spine offers, throughout it's spine.<br/><br/>Carpe, you're just refering to choosing from amongst the many choices a chess game provides in it's serial spine format. You're not describing a lateral dislocate AT ALL! You are just describing play in a serial spine game.<br/><br/>This is probably the big hurdle to get ones head around, if you think that in a traditional game as GM if you choose to start a combat, that it's like choosing to move a pawn forward in chess. No, not at all. If you think of a traditional RPG as actually about a half dozen seperate boardgames (one of them being combat), then what you are doing is like choosing to play chess to begin with, when you choose to activate the combat rules.<br/><br/>The lateral dislocate choice is like "Which boardgame will I play tonight?", it's not like "Which chess piece will I move?" (which is serial spine)<br/><br/>Anyway, if I play chess, then <i>after </i>I play poker, it's not playing some chessy/pokery overall game. It's just one game after another. Dislocated from each other.<br/><br/>You might not buy the hypothesis, fair enough, but try and describe in your own words how you understand the idea.

I was trying to say that since this procedural presentation of GURPS combat is nigh untenable, the rules themselves have underlying problems and the declarative/LD presentation of them in the GURPS main books just hides or delays those issues, it doesn\u2019t solve them.<br/>\n<blockquote>It's a curious perspective you take - but it appears 2097 is taking it too?

Another reason is the established language in programming, a discipline similar to rules writing but with a few very important differences.\n<blockquote>A serial sequence can offer you 100 choices.

Sequentially going onto one of these offers a further 100 choices.</blockquote>\nI\u2019ve been trying to say that, too.<br/><br/>I think that roleplaying rules should, at least at some point during their development,  be stated in procedural format\u2014what you, Callan, call Serial Spine format. (And I\u2019m fine with \u201cend game\u201d being just \u201cwhen you grow tired of playing\u201d.)<br/><br/>And the way that they are finally presented to the reader should be in a much more practical format than the encyclopedic/declarative/Lateral Dislocate style that is common today.<br/><br/>Whether that format is Serial Spine or something else is up for grabs but as it stands, I don\u2019t think many games are particularly usable.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409420/#Comment_409420" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-18T03:08:54+00:00" title="March 18, 2013  3:08AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2013 3:09AM by Rickard.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Go 2097!

The second rule is that the GM may grant players bonuses or penalties for situations of advantage or disadvantage.  If the GM decides whether or not I get to roll my Diplomacy skill, I have to get his permission to use the rules.

That's how chess is played - every piece offers choices (lots of choices - not sure how many, on each of your (serial) turns, fewer choices as you lose pieces). Everyone plays chess in a serial spine manner. Not everyone chooses the same choices that the serial spine offers, throughout it's spine.<br/></blockquote>\nThen as a matter of technicality, any game can fall under the definition of "serial spine", because any game can be described via the following serial structure:<br/><br/>1. One player does something.<br/>2. Another player does something. Go back to step 1.<br/><br/>Chess, at its core, is a lateral organization of serial modules, which is exactly what "lateral dislocate" games are, and what the majority of RPGs period are. In reality, any game has serial and lateral elements, so trying to pinpoint a game as one or the other based on a few choice details is ultimately fruitless. You have to look at the overall structure.<br/><br/>Chess is not really a procedural game, because it's driven by a series of "state checks". Let's restate the game in lateral form:<br/><br/>There are two colors: Black and White. White moves first. The players alternate moving one piece at a time.<br/>There is a specific setup of pieces.<br/>Each piece has a unique mode of movement.<br/>When a piece ends its movement on another piece, the latter piece is "captured" and removed from the board.<br/>When the King of either side is able to be attacked, this is "check", and that player must cause the King to no longer be in check.<br/>When the King is in check, and that player cannot take the King out of check, this is "checkmate", and that player loses.<br/><br/>There's a few quirky rules (pawn promotion, en passant, and castling), but that up there is the base structure, a bunch of lateral instructions which nonetheless provide a pretty passable game.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a>,<br/>I definitely agree there. Serial hooks are necessary to understand a system which is largely lateral.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409437/#Comment_409437" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-18T06:38:48+00:00" title="March 18, 2013  6:38AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2013 6:40AM by 2097.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The rules of chess can be stated procedurally,  declarative/laterally, as a mix or in other ways.<br/>As a reader, I have a preference against the declarative a.k.a. lateral form                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409438/#Comment_409438" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-18T06:42:59+00:00" title="March 18, 2013  6:42AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suppose what makes the most sense is to say that games ought to have lateral structure but serial formatting for way of explanation.<br/><br/>Serial structures, after all, are good to start learning but bad to teach mastery.

Why? Because lateral structures (modules) interact in a large number of ways. Lateral structures are ultimately about defining various entities that will interact with one another in various ways. This allows you to utilize an emergent "rules physics", and to adjucate/predict reliably what happens when the game strays from the expected experience.<br/><br/>On the flip side, serial structures focus gameplay on a particular experience (or set of experiences). However, each choice that a serial structure offers multiplies the number of possible outcomes that must all be accounted for. This naturally leads to a serial structure leaving outcomes with no means to adjucate them beyond common sense/fiat.<br/><br/>One gives no direction; the other gives no way to judge the unexpected. The best answer is to hybridize them to great effect, and this is what most games do. Could they stand for more direction? Certainly.

However, see the LD example in the OP. You could reconstruct the SS game from it, but you could also end up with an unplayable mess.<br/>\n<blockquote>One gives no direction; the other gives no way to judge the unexpected.</blockquote>\nOne game I dig in this regard is 3:16. It has a few methods for unexpected things, while still being very unambiguously presented as a game. I don\u2019t think ways to judge unexpected things is inherently harder with the procedural style\u2014rather, the other way around. A solid framework that gives room for things to happen in the fiction and for participants to agree on those things.

Let's look at a couple rules from D&amp;D3. The first rule is that the Diplomacy skill can be used to convince NPCs to do stuff. The second rule is that the GM may grant players bonuses or penalties for situations of advantage or disadvantage. If the GM decides whether or not I get to roll my Diplomacy skill, I have to get his permission to use the rules. When the GM decides whether or not I get a bonus, we are following the rule because the rule says that that's what he's supposed to do.</blockquote>\nWith diplomacy, do you feel your owed or promised use of those rules?<br/><br/>I'd think getting to roll <i>at all</i> is in itself an advantage like getting a bonus is an advantage?<br/><br/>Clarification note: If the text is a serial spine one and the next step says you roll diplomacy, then if the GM/anyone doesn't, they are breaking the agreed upon activity. I'd just agree with you in this case, if you were refering to a SS game. In lateral dislocate, there's no agreement on what cluster of rules (like the skill cluster: diplomacy) is used next.<br/><br/><b><br/>CarpeGuitarrem</b>,\n<blockquote>Chess, at its core, is a lateral organization of serial modules, which is exactly what "lateral dislocate" games are, and what the majority of RPGs period are. In reality, any game has serial and lateral elements, so trying to pinpoint a game as one or the other based on a few choice details is ultimately fruitless. You have to look at the overall structure.<br/><br/>Chess is not really a procedural game, because it's driven by a series of "state checks". Let's restate the game in lateral form:<br/><br/>There are two colors: Black and White. White moves first. The players alternate moving one piece at a time.<br/>There is a specific setup of pieces.<br/>Each piece has a unique mode of movement.<br/>When a piece ends its movement on another piece, the latter piece is "captured" and removed from the board.<br/>When the King of either side is able to be attacked, this is "check", and that player must cause the King to no longer be in check.<br/>When the King is in check, and that player cannot take the King out of check, this is "checkmate", and that player loses.<br/><br/>There's a few quirky rules (pawn promotion, en passant, and castling), but that up there is the base structure, a bunch of lateral instructions which nonetheless provide a pretty passable game.</blockquote>\nThat's still serial spine - you go through all those state checks in a serial fashion. They are all state checks that the game, one after the other, tells you to do, aren't they?<br/><br/>You calling it lateral dislocate. But in lateral dislocate the game does NOT tell you to check anything.<br/><br/>Tell me in chess, is it okay to skip checking whether checkmate has occured? Not really - because you've been told to do it by the game.<br/><br/>In a traditional RPG, are you told you HAVE TO run the combat rules at any particular point?<br/><br/>As I said, this is gunna be the big hurdle to get over, eg the hurdle being the notion that the state checks in chess and the various rule clusters in a traditional RPG are the same deal.\n<blockquote>However, each choice that a serial structure offers multiplies the number of possible outcomes that must all be accounted for. This naturally leads to a serial structure leaving outcomes with no means to adjucate them beyond common sense/fiat.<br/><br/>One gives no direction; the other gives no way to judge the unexpected.</blockquote>\nNo, a serial structure isn't left with outcomes with no means to adjudicate them, unless the author got lazy and did not finish writing out the spine. I suspect you expect that every single fictional description that people might say needs to be covered - and you are saying serial spine can't cover all of those spoken fiction outcomes. I'll give an simplistic example of serial spine - say step 10 is to talk with NPC X, then step 11 is to roll diplomacy. I think you're saying that if the player up and declares they kill NPC X in step 10, then the spine just can't adjudicate that outcome?<br/><br/><br/><b>2097</b>,\n<blockquote>Callan, I just found your old Warhammer!

You can't find 'the way', as I said before, not because an inability to see, but a better capacity to see - an ability to see there are just dislocate components without any connection between them.<br/><br/>I moved to a new area and the games club here has alot of boardgamers. And it's a really different culture - they pursue procedure avidly and with interest, they hunger for currencies and enjoy in game conflict. The thing is, if you look at them playing a boardgame, it all works. It's an event, it's a thing. And you've read my warhammer thread - if you're like me and pretty much never boardgamed and just went straight to roleplay as a teen, you might be used to the play event having all the vibrancy described in that account - which is nothing like the energy around the boardgame players.<br/><br/>So you've got all these RP gamers around talking about 'the way', and maybe you've never really seen that boardgame culture is a vibrant and energised event. And so with no alternative, you've never considered pitching 'the way' in the bin for the alternative (because there seemed to be no alternative) and instead simply taking the vibrant boardgame culture on, with serially written games which are part boardgame, and part allow someone to choose amongst options the rules present them, based on their reaction to fiction other people speak. Slowly a number of indie RPGs, like 3:16, seem to be doing this, but the authors seem to be in the closet about it.<br/><br/>Or maybe I'm not reading you right again? I think part of my own issue in writing in the interveening years is I just don't like the 'we kill and keep winning and getting stronger' genre, which is the dominant genre. Recently I accidently made up something more like a 'get better and better at toughing out damage while also getting better at running away and escaping' kind of genre, and I'm really liking it.

Instead, the game outlines the objective of each player (module <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231--also&amp;Mode=like">#1--also</a>, having an objective does not make a game Serial Spine, else you could make a claim for any conceivable game being Serial Spine), a general turn order (module #2), and then the various means by which pieces move. The conclusions are left to be drawn by the players; that's what happens during the process of learning to play chess well. You are never told to choose between the Sicilian Defense or the King's Gambit to start off. You make a move, and the rules of the game tell you the consequences of that move. There is no "spine" connecting one move to another, save the spine which is crafted by the players. We call this spine the "strategy" of the player (or "tactics", in its short-term application). The existence of a player-created spine is essential to the definition of Lateral Dislocate, as you've set it out. (Either that, or what you call "Lateral Dislocate" is so narrow as to be utterly meaningless.)<br/><br/>Also, I believe one could make the case that in a traditional RPG, you are implicitly told to run the combat rules in certain situations. Sure, the rules aren't technically 100% binding, but if a Serial Spine game must have 100% binding rules, then you cannot adjucate it to any degree.<br/><br/>So, then. I actually believe that one could make an argument that traditional RPGs qualify for your serial/procedural designation.<br/><br/>1. A Choose Your Own Adventure book would be an example of tightly-restricted Serial Spine, right?<br/>2. However, you've also allowed for GM adjucation to interrupt the strict flow of the Serial.<br/>3. So, "a CYOA book where you have the freedom to do things and have it adjucated" would be an apt description of SS.<br/>4. That's one of the cliche definitions of a traditional RPG. (I'd challenge anyone to find a meaningful divergence between <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> and traditional RPGs.)<br/><br/>Further--I believe that there's a confusion being made between how a game is presented and what a game implicitly is. You could present a game in a serial or a lateral style, but that doesn't make the game inherently serial or lateral. I suggest stepping back from the notion that a game must be classed as one or the other, and noting that pretty much all games qualify as both, to a degree. Emphasizing one element over the other is a potent tool for communicating certain portions of the game in different ways, and understanding the benefits and drawbacks of each is crucial to game design.<br/><br/>(I'd also recommend you check out more games. The ones I mentioned with a strong Serial Spine presentation are pretty prominent for the way that they mess with typical RPG expectations.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409547/#Comment_409547" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-18T23:12:31+00:00" title="March 18, 2013 11:12PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2013 11:44PM by Callan_S.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Zeroing in on this, because in the rules of chess, you are never explicitly told to check anything.

(An area of hexes you can go to, and in some of them there are dungeons you can take multiple paths through.)<br/>But I want to codify a very turn-based structure that I see hints of in B/X.<br/>\u2014 What do you want to do?<br/>\u2014 We go to the hex north east from here.<br/>\u2014 It\u2019ll take (\u2026 looks over how heavy they\u2019re packed) eight hours to get to the center of it.<br/>\u2014 Fine.<br/>DM rolls some dice, finds out there is a lair of evil sphinxes.<br/>\u2014 After six hours of travel you see [start describing lair].<br/>\u2014 We try to sneak around it.<br/>etc etc<br/><br/>And in the dungeon, turns are ten minutes unless in fights.<br/>\u2014 You see a hall with an altar made of what looks like deep-red glass. There are exits east and northwest.<br/>\u2014 We strike every square of the floor with our ten foot poles, from a distance.<br/>\u2014 It takes ten minutes. Nothing happens.<br/>\u2014 We go east.<br/>\u2014 It takes ten minutes [or maybe the GM just checks of a ten minute mark in her book]. You see [\u2026]<br/><br/>According to the rules, it takes less than ten minutes to travel through already explored areas.<br/>I need to work all these kinks out\u2014you can see that I\u2019m not there yet.<br/>And once I got <i>that</i> worked out, I want to somehow make it work for urban fantasy (like Buffy).<br/>Not sure it\u2019s possible\u2026<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409551/#Comment_409551" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-18T23:32:55+00:00" title="March 18, 2013 11:32PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>1.

All of that stuff, even the stuff we think of as core like character stats. hit points, combat rolls, whatever, that's all advanced, optional stuff that can be used or not used.<br/><br/>Really, even the very stuff we'd consider essential.<br/><br/>The real game is a simple verbal play back and forth. It's Mother May I with a fantasy theme for D&amp;D. It's a Choose Your Own Adventure Book, built ad hoc with one player taking on the role of the author.<br/><br/>As a game, cut down to its core, it's very simplistic. You could describe it in a page or two.  And, it does involve a great deal of human judgment, mostly on the part of the GM, but also on the part of the character players when trying to entertain the GM with their responses and in doing so get him to respond with something they wanted to see happen next in the fiction being created.<br/><br/>All that other stuff, it's all commonly used advanced techniques. Or maybe just tools, mostly for the DM to grab onto as they see fit, or because randomness sparkes creativity. Or because everyone agrees it's a bit more entertaining that way.<br/><br/>Or at least that's what it all adds up to in very common practice.<br/><br/>If you view it through that lens, there's a lot of stuff you can then do with it.<br/><br/>You can make the whole thing vastly more procedural.<br/><br/>Or, you could clarify what is going on in practice, make sure everyone is aware that's what is going on, and look at all of that other stuff as just the optional tools they are in reality for classic RPG play.<br/><br/>Callan seems to have been drawn to one possibility, myself to the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409579/#Comment_409579" name="Item_99" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-19T07:43:36+00:00" title="March 19, 2013  7:43AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote> <br/>Owed or promised?

[/joke]\n<blockquote>what's the difference between a serial spine game with a massive number of options and a lateral dislocate game, save that the latter game doesn't explicitly demonstrate the choices at every step of the way?</blockquote>\nWhat's the difference between a serial spine game which <i>presents </i>a massive number of options and a lateral dislocate game which does <b>not</b> present any choices?<br/><br/>I know your responding argument pretty much backwards "Yes, LD doesn't present them explicitly!? So what? Sure, LD doesn't explicitly demonstrate the choices at each step - but it's, like, there! It just takes a bit of common sense! So what's the difference between a SS presenting a massive number of options and an LD, when the LD HAS choices - it's just not explicit about them...just a little bit quiet about them...very quiet..."<br/><br/>Alternatively no, LD presents no choices, as much as a toolbox doesn't present choices, and for decades you've played as if you were simply taking non explicit choices the LD game was non explicitly presenting you, when really you weren't. All that time. I know, it's a hell of a conclusion to arrive at.<br/><br/>I know you don't agree with it. But it's not like it's crazy impossible - a missunderstanding going on for years? That's hardly an impossible thing to happen. So at the very least I think we can agree the notion of a long term missunderstanding is plausible (even if one doesn't agree it's applicable).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409643/#Comment_409643" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-19T18:02:53+00:00" title="March 19, 2013  6:02PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>It's like trying to ask a programmer whether they are talking about the text form of the program, or the program.<br/><br/>If the game text and 'game itself' seem to have drifted away from each other to become two seperate entities, well this thread is about pointing out that drift - and stating that that's not actually the state of things.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nYour analogy to programming is an apt one.  Where "text form of the program" = source code, that's a common distinction.

I mean the game presented in the rulebook, not the thing that gets played at the table.  You are right, those are different things, especially when the game presented in the rulebook is not complete.  It's a little weird because the game is this kind of intangible thing.  A couple examples:<br/><br/>Chess exists as a game, and that's distinct from the various different explanations of the rules.  So if I buy one chess set it has a rules book, and you buy another and it has different rule book with different words in it, but they both describe the same game.

I'm guessing instead of a game that ends, you want a game that loops - so where do you want it to loop? At what point in the procedure have they done something, that it aught to loop back now (presumably so as to do that thing again, because it's what your game is about)?<br/><br/>I'm more asking questions in case it helps out with your design, rather than in direct relation to the clearing up of terms that's happening right now.\n<blockquote><blockquote>Chess can't be stated in LD form unless you subtract the sequential order of instructions from it/remove its spine (at which point it ceases to be chess (or atleast ceases to be vanilla chess)).</blockquote>\nAH, I see.<br/>So if you take all the rules of chess, garble the order and it\u2019s still SS.<br/>But if you remove this one: \u201cPlayers alternate making one half-move each.\u201d it becomes LD.</blockquote>\nI'm not sure why you say half moves- but if you remove the players having turns (and so with it, what each player does on each turn), then yes, it becomes LD.<br/><br/>In my original SS example, it might have been clearer if I'd had a step 0 that read 'To play this game, follow the following numbers in sequential order, or if they direct you to another number, go to that number and after completing the step, either go to the next step or whatever number that step directs you to'. But it seems so pedantic and obvious (when the sequential numbers are there) I didn't.

My point was that both are complete and correct explanations of chess, but that the explanations are still different.<br/><br/>Rewritten Game 4 (rules of game 1, structure of game 2):<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>This is a game for two players.  The first player follows the instructions in Chapters 1-5.  The second player, called the GM, follows the instructions in Chapter 6.<br/><br/>Chapter 1: Character Generation<br/>You have a fictional character represented by 10 HP.<br/><br/>Chapter 2: Combat<br/>When your character fights a monster, rolls 1D6 for each. If your roll is equal to or higher than the monster's roll, you beat it and can continue. If the monster's roll is higher, you lose 1 HP. If you lose all 10 HP, you lose the game and the game ends. Keep rolling until either you or the monster is beaten. You may describe a fictional account of your attack on the monster.<br/><br/>Chapter 3: Monsters<br/>Whenever you travel 1 km at a time a monster appears and fights you.<br/><br/>Chapter 4: Movement<br/>After creating a character, and whenever you've got no monsters to fight, you travel. Roll 1D6 - this is how far you travel in kilometers. Record the amount after traveling it.<br/><br/>Chapter 5: Adventures<br/>You have a travel distance of 20 kilometers you need to make to complete this game. If you make it to 20km, you win.<br/><br/>Chapter 6: GM advice<br/>If you (the GM) feel moved to do so, you may grant the player +2 added upon his dice roll when fighting a monster. If the player still doesn't beat the monster, he continues to use the +2 bonus until the monster is defeated.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409930/#Comment_409930" name="Item_118" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T09:48:34+00:00" title="March 21, 2013  9:48AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/timonkey">@timonkey</a>,<br/><br/>The one thing I'd change, unless I'm misunderstanding things, is the condition in Chapter 4: it triggers as a procedural reaction to Chapter 1.

I don't know why you've sort of just ignored that and written a complete version? I essentially want you to deliberately sabotage game 4 and write a version that doesn't tell you when to roll the 1D6 (it still tells you about rolling 1D6, but doesn't tell you when) - then we'll compare game 4 and the sabotaged version of game 4 and compare the differences (if any). I seemed to have been clear in my post before about this - but it seems odd that you've gone right past what I said, all the same?\n<blockquote>Also, I think you misunderstood my chess rules example, as you said their had rules for rooks. My point was that both are complete and correct explanations of chess, but that the explanations are still different.</blockquote>\nI understood it then took it a step further and asked you, if one of the texts didn't actually have rules for moving a rook, in your estimate is that just 'a different explanation' or 'an explanation sooo different it actually lacks a rule'?<br/><br/><br/>CG,\n<blockquote>Uh, I think that a toolbox is chock-full of options for anyone who wants options. I mean, I thought that was an obvious fact.</blockquote>\nIf no ones agreed to their use (or lack of use), then no, a toolbox does not provide you any choices at all. Pick up an RPG and call out to people passing in the street that they need to make a save vs petrification. They will look at you strange and keep walking. Clearly no, the toolbox doesn't provide you any options. You need an agreement.<br/><br/>I think I know what happens at this point in discussion - it's rather like komradebob's comment, in that you say 'but everyone knows that they agree to...' and then I say 'how do they know?' and you say 'because...common RPG gaming culture, that's why'<br/><br/>I'll put forward the idea that most peoples idea of 'common' roleplay culture is utterly uncommon to anyone elses. In broad strokes it might match up, but in particulars they don't match at all - people don't have the same agreement on the use (or non use) of things in the toolbox. When one of these missmatches coes up in play, it's...not a good moment. Witness a brief example I ran across today - <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?676099-B-X-Misadventures-in-randomly-generated-dungeons&amp;p=16566127#post16566127" rel="nofollow">"Take it back!"</a><br/><br/>The toolbox grants you no options. Only people do. And they can't when the text is ambigious or just plain doesn't describe what they need to agree to.<br/><br/>Or such is one of the ideas of the thread. If you don't agree, okay - I've presented the idea, anyway, so mission accomplished in regard to that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410000/#Comment_410000" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T17:56:26+00:00" title="March 21, 2013  5:56PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan can you name a non-hypothetical game that does not tell the player when to roll a die?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410039/#Comment_410039" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T23:45:42+00:00" title="March 21, 2013 11:45PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Callan can you name a non-hypothetical game that does not tell the player when to roll a die?</blockquote>\ntimonkeys game 4.

In retrospect, you should say things like \u201cI try to jump the chasm\u201d, you\u2019d take your skillvalue in chasm-jumping (or whatever, the closest one) and there\u2018s a table for CL which stands for \u201cchance of success\u201d which you roll on.

It seems a small task and I don't want to bias the conclusion by stating why - you'd just find out by running the experiment yourself. If you don't want to, okay, I'll leave it there.<br/><br/><br/>Tulpa, <br/><br/>The fun thing is you don't read the quote as allowing your character to use the skill of, say, diplomacy, when the spoken fiction has revolved around climbing a cliff. For you the text seems contrained in what kind of roll can be made. "You just wouldn't use diplomacy to climb a cliff!!" you'd say.<br/><br/>I know I seem to create the strawman here - but then you refer to how the games are written. Write some programming code based around that quote and the program wont care if you use diplomacy or insight to climb a cliff. It really wont.<br/><br/>You've ignored what is written and instead treat your subjective reaction to the text as if it's part of the text - you treat the 'can't use diplomacy to climb a cliff' notion as if it's in the text, when it isn't - the strawman is yours. Yes, remove the corrections - remove your strawman you're adding to the text. Then see how little the text actually tells you.<br/><br/>But I know, it'll seem like I'm adding this ludicrous capacity to climb cliffs with sense motive or diplomacy - ie a strawman, and you'll correct me on how the game is written.<br/><br/>It's weird though - I could write a tiny, silly little game where you use diplomacy to climb a cliff.<br/>1. You have a diplomacy skill - this is your only skill. It gives you +2 to a roll.<br/>2. You are facing a cliff. Use your one and only skill to climb the cliff, by rolling 1D6 and add the bonus. If you get a 4 or higher, you made it (go to step 3). Otherwise you plunge to your death.<br/>3. You made it! You win, congrats!<br/><br/>If you try and insist you use climb, then you are just reading badly - inventing a strawman.<br/><br/>Surely the only way my game works out is if you follow whats <i>actually</i> in the game text. Rather than adding restrictions which just aren't there in the text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410159/#Comment_410159" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T17:04:20+00:00" title="March 22, 2013  5:04PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2013 5:23PM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>ok so I just looked up the d20 srd and it said "When your character uses a skill, you make a skill check to see how well he or she does."

Now, maybe explanation quality has degraded some since then (I honestly don't remember), but I'm paging through the Moldvay Basic D&amp;D PDF...<br/><br/>Good night. It's <b>all laid out</b>, with crystal precision. "Here's what a GM is, here's the role players have, here's what a 'dungeon' is, here's what an 'adventure' is, and here's the basic actions you're taking." Plus a brief outline and summary of what's in each chapter, then a direct instruction to go to Chapter 2 to make your character.<br/><br/>That's the opening chapter: oodles of very clear direction. I haven't finished reading yet, but so far, it belies that paradigm. That's why I say context is lacking.

Callan's SS example in the first post tells the structure of how a session is going to be played (a sequence of play). That's what I'm interested in. Normally, the chapter for writing adventures are at the end of roleplaying books when it should be at the beginning.<br/><br/>I skimmed through <b>Hollowpoint</b> this morning and it had the same structure as timonkey's <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/post/quote/18091/Comment_410169" rel="nofollow">example</a>, which I feel is backwards. I had to puzzle things together in my mind to understand how the game worked. I think it would be more intuitive if timonkey's example instead had the structure 4, 3, 2, 1 (not necessary) and finally 5.\n<blockquote>Chapter 4: Adventures<br/>You have a travel distance of 20 kilometers you need to make to complete this game. You travel 1d6 kilometers at a time.

She didn't understand what the skills were for, and I couldn't really explain it without showing it in a situation. So creating a character before you start playing seems really backwards in roleplaying games.

Well-named skills are self-explanatory.<br/><br/>I think the mention of <b>Hollowpoint</b> brings up the reason why I'm bothered by the direction this discussion took. When viewed in the lens of rules-organization, yeah, it's a lateral design. But that's just a question of "how well are your rules arranged to explain the game?" I think that question is a red herring. The same game, as has been demonstrated, can be arranged in many different ways and yet remain essentially the same.<br/><br/>The more interesting question, to me, is whether a game's actual form is serial or modular, when you take the appearance of the rules off the table. There, <b>Hollowpoint</b> is most definitely a serial game (even if the rules are organized in a modular fashion), because it's about the characters following a specific course of action and making choices along the way. If the characters wanted to open a barista, continuing the game would require everyone to reframe that barista in terms of the Objective-Conflict spine of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410246/#Comment_410246" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T14:00:36+00:00" title="March 23, 2013  2:00PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan, have you checked out <a href="http://legendaryquest.com/" rel="nofollow">these fascinating RPG design patterns?</a>\n<blockquote>I think that question is a red herring[\u2026]The more interesting question, to me,</blockquote>\nTwo completely separate questions, yes, but both very important.

Telling people what to do - ie, telling them when to roll the D6!

And in doing so proving to yourself that it does not tell you when to roll and so is missing a vital chunk of rules.

Perhaps if I just told everyone to make games with procedural gaps in them (LD games), then everyone would start making SS games? lol!<br/><br/>And here's the bit I would chuck on the front of game 4 to make it complete (which uncannily is kinda like an introduction added on).

How should you be able to know how the situations are created where you're about to use a skill? Look at how boardgames explain rules. They start with the win condition, then set-up and followed by a linear structure (a structure of play) for how to play the game. Even if you can do several things during one phase of the game (like doing <b>AW</b> moves), it's still in a structure of play. I talked about that <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/408549#Comment_408549" rel="nofollow">earlier in the thread</a>.<br/><br/>Look at <b>timonkey</b>'s example.

It "starts" instead with chapter four. Instantly you know what the game is about, and every chapter from there builds upon that. The same goes with how you play the game, or it becomes dislocated.\n<blockquote>There, <b>Hollowpoint</b> is most definitely a serial game (even if the rules are organized in a modular fashion),</blockquote>\nThat's what I think is so weird with Hollowpoint. They describe length and value in a dice roll - and have even an example - but it's not until some headlines later they describe what those terms really does. It's not until the following <i>chapter</i> that they actually explain <i>why</i> you do a dice roll. Up until chapter five, they say it's about "conflicts" ... whatever that means. It wasn't until they start talking about missions and why you have conflicts in mission that I understood why I should roll dice. They also talk about principals in chapter 4, but it's not until chapter 5 that they explain <i>why</i> you have principals and how to create them. It's backwards. It's all backwards.<br/><br/>Now, what I meant was that (picking skills during) character generation have the same problem as length, value and principals in Hollowpoint. You can't really understand them until you know how the game should be played out.<br/><br/>(Note: I think Hollowpoint have some cool ideas, but the game is a great example when they actually <i>have a truly serial structure</i>, but still uses the traditional structure of presenting the game, which is ... weird.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410259/#Comment_410259" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T16:11:03+00:00" title="March 23, 2013  4:11PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So assuming someone of equal certainty as yours (yet they are certain another skill is involved*), you'll bicker for a good long time at the game table.

But do me a favour and think of skills during character creation the  next time you introduce a beginner to roleplaying games. Or try to reread my last two posts with a blank mind. A mind that doesn't know what roleplaying games are.\n<blockquote>Ultimately, the difference between what's being claimed as "serial spine" versus "lateral dislocate" is this: <b>a serial spine game is one where the game does a significant amount of hand-holding</b>.</blockquote>\nYou make the bold part sound like it's something negative. When I read your game, I want to learn how to play your game, otherwise it's just another game with different names on it's skills. A game where I have to bring my own conventions to the game. [edit] Just as you did when answering my posts.

There's just a major lack of assigned authority involved in traditional RPG's - it just leaves people to struggle with it. I'm guessing you don't see any difference to leaving two people to struggle with it Vs the text both parties agreed to assigning one of them the final say on the matter (the other one doesn't have to compromise, they just have to acknowledge the final say they agreed to)<br/><br/>Anyway, you think a rulebook can't do anything. I'd disagree. Really either we discuss that a rulebook can handle this (before going on to anything else), or I guess there isn't anything to discuss otherwise.\n<blockquote>(I don't think the "echo chamber" criticism even applies to a game. It's a fun activity you do with friends, not a legislature or news agency or debating society.

That if you can't agree on a bit of fiction, you're not getting along - the dude could drag your ass out of a house fire, but if he keeps insisting skill X be used instead of skill Y in a fictional situation, that must mean you don't get along with him!?<br/><br/>Okay, how I'd put your quote is if someone imagines things differently from you, you'd say you don't get along with them. I'd disagree. I think, at best, it's being picky.<br/><br/><br/>CarpeGuitarrem,\n<blockquote>What generally happens next is that players will then say "Can I use Skill X to do Y?" I think that most people, without having that explained, can pick up on that pretty simply.</blockquote>\nPick up on what?<br/><br/>If we were talking a boardgame and you were refering to looking up in the text whether they can do Y, okay.<br/><br/>But here, pick up on what?<br/><br/>It's the preverbial emperors new clothes - if everyone just refers to something as being there, "it's there". Until someone asks. I know the spoken fiction is going to rush in and apparently fill the void 'well if we were talking about climbing a cliff, <i>then</i> that determines...'. When spoken fiction doesn't determine anything (it's just sound waves) and it's a subjective choice made by someone to use skill X (maybe climb), which they choose from the LD bunch of rules components scattered willy nilly before them.<br/><br/>Of course if you take it that 'pick up' is in regard to interaction with a smooth, well oiled set of mechanics, it would appear as smooth and well oiled as much as any of our subjective choices come to our minds in a fluid and well oiled way.<br/><br/>Or at least I propose nothing is there - whats happening is everyone is acting like they are working by some kind of singular system. While the singular system they each imagine happens to align with what others imagine, it goes smoothly.\n<blockquote>a serial spine game is one where the game does a significant amount of hand-holding. </blockquote>\nYou're defaulting to an ad homenim - which is either astute, or ass, given peoples perception of how valid they think an ad homenim is to determining anything. Not to mention name calling at the boardgame community. Let go of this one.<br/><br/><br/>timonkey,<br/>I gave the skill use example above. Tulpa's given textual examples of what is just more LD design by the measure I'm applying. Why do you want to get into this - in the interest of seeing how a text could have an addition made to make it SS? Or are you questioning whether there are procedural abscences at all? if it's the latter, I'd have to flip it around and ask you for examples of where you think the procedure is complete, since it's not me making the claim that something exists.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee" title="TildeSee"><img alt="TildeSee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee">TildeSee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410303/#Comment_410303" name="Item_150" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-24T07:42:16+00:00" title="March 24, 2013  7:42AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2013 7:44AM by TildeSee.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ugh...

In lots of traditional games, isn't full authority explicitly put in the hands of the GM?  And plenty of board game rules aren't perfectly clear, but none of them give authority over rules disputes.  Do you see this as a problem for them?<br/>\n<blockquote><br/>timonkey,<br/>I gave the skill use example above. Tulpa's given textual examples of what is just more LD design by the measure I'm applying. </blockquote>\nDid you see Tulpa's post I'm quoting here:\n<blockquote>This is incorrect, again from the d20srd (and most traditional games have similar passages.)<br/>"You can change the attitudes of others (nonplayer characters) with a successful Diplomacy check"<br/>"With a successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or some other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds) at one-quarter your normal speed."<br/><br/>I can no more change the attitudes of a non player character in 3.x D&amp;D with a climb check than I can climb a wall with a diplomacy check. There is no assumption on my part.</blockquote>\nThose are pretty clear rules about what you can do with the skills.\n<blockquote>Why do you want to get into this - in the interest of seeing how a text could have an addition made to make it SS? Or are you questioning whether there are procedural abscences at all? if it's the latter, I'd have to flip it around and ask you for examples of where you think the procedure is complete, since it's not me making the claim that something exists.</blockquote>\nI'm questioning, as someone kind of got at a little earlier, the extent to which these procedural absences really exist.  The onus is on you, as you are the one making the claim of an absence of procedure.

There's just a major lack of assigned authority involved in traditional RPG's - it just leaves people to struggle with it. I'm guessing you don't see any difference to leaving two people to struggle with it Vs the text both parties agreed to assigning one of them the final say on the matter (the other one doesn't have to compromise, they just have to acknowledge the final say they agreed to)<br/><br/>Anyway, you think a rulebook can't do anything. I'd disagree. Really either we discuss that a rulebook can handle this (before going on to anything else), or I guess there isn't anything to discuss otherwise.</blockquote>\nCallan, Callan, Callan, mon petite fromage, I took you at your word when your example was two people who <i>cannot under any circumstances</i> find a way to agree. It's a weird example, totally contrary to my own experience, but that may be because I won't willingly spend time with that sort of person anywhere besides the internet (and even then, only for the five or so minutes it takes to write a reply to their post, whereupon I blissfully forget their existence for another day or so).<br/><br/>That kind of person from your example is going to argue with or without a book. If they agree that someone else has the final say on the matter, <i>then they have already compromised</i>. Won't the person from your example just disagree with the rulebook and/or use the rulebook as a stick to beat the other person with, since they firmly believe the one thing and will never, ever stop arguing their point? It's asking an awful lot of a rulebook to expect it to fix that person's brain.<br/><br/>So, no, you're getting what I said wrong: I am not saying that a rulebook can't do <i>anything</i>. I'm saying it can't do <i>everything</i>. A good set of rules can minimize struggles, but some people (and please don't think that I'm necessarily pointing the finger at you, here) just like to argue, and will bend over backwards to continue their argument because that's all they want.<br/><br/>Which leads neatly to your next bit:\n<blockquote><blockquote>(I don't think the "echo chamber" criticism even applies to a game. It's a fun activity you do with friends, not a legislature or news agency or debating society. People should play games with people they can get along with!)</blockquote>\nThis is such a dismal, seemingly <i>gamer </i>expectation. That if you can't agree on a bit of fiction, you're not getting along - the dude could drag your ass out of a house fire, but if he keeps insisting skill X be used instead of skill Y in a fictional situation, that must mean you don't get along with him!?<br/><br/>Okay, how I'd put your quote is if someone imagines things differently from you, you'd say you don't get along with them. I'd disagree. I think, at best, it's being picky.</blockquote>\nWell, you put my quote wrong, then. Not much I can do about that except try to explain it in shorter words? Are there shorter words? Let's try!<br/><br/>I have friends. I get along with my friends. I don't always agree with them, but when we disagree about something, we can argue about it for a <i>little while</i> and we soon reach an answer that we can both live with. We still get along. That's what working out those different opinions is! A disagreement during a game isn't a failure of the game or the group, if everyone stays cool and actually works out a solution to it. It's great, it actually brings everyone closer together.<br/><br/>But imagine I'm with the person from your example, the person who is absolutely, 100% opposed to whatever I think and will never, ever compromise. Every argument goes on forever, and there are a LOT of arguments. THAT is a situation where you cannot get along with the person, and that is a person you shouldn't game with. It's a game, you should play it with someone who is willing to play it <i>with</i> you.<br/><br/>Going all Fox News on this idea and saying it's an echo chamber is, frankly, dumb. Play with people you can disagree amiably with, and who you can work out your disagreements with: that's awesome, it's so much fun, oh my god you will not believe how much fun it can be.<br/><br/>Don't play with people like the ones in your example, the ones who just want to argue all the time over points that apparently will never, ever be settled. I don't know where you're finding those people, but wherever you found them, <i>don't play with them.</i> Let them save you from a house fire. Go ahead and argue politics with them. Dance at their wedding. Paint a magnificent portrait of them if the spirit so moves you, be their bestest friend EVER if that's how things can be, but if you cannot <i>under any circumstances</i> settle an argument in a game like friends, then don't play that game with them. Just don't. You will be a better person for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biggles" title="biggles"><img alt="biggles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biggles">biggles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410331/#Comment_410331" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-24T16:22:23+00:00" title="March 24, 2013  4:22PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Skipped reading most of thread like a pro.

How much more tortured can the language get?<br/><br/>If all you are doing is merely questioning the existance of absences, then you're not making any a claim complete procedure exists in the LD examples. Good, neither of us are saying complete procedure exists in the LD examples - not me, and not you because all you are doing is questioning an absence and <i>not</i> making any claim of anything existing.<br/><br/>There's your proof - you've never claimed full procedure exists in the examples, therefore it seems you don't think full procedure exists in them, same as me.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote>but that may be because I won't willingly spend time with that sort of person anywhere besides the internet (and even then, only for the five or so minutes it takes to write a reply to their post, whereupon I blissfully forget their existence for another day or so).</blockquote>\nNo, I find a subtext here that I don't think makes for honest conversation. If it's that this discussion is a forgetable game rather than an intellectually honest conversation, I'll decline to continue it with you and will read no further than I have here. I hope I've missread that subtext and there's a genuine desire to engage, rather than - a rather poisonous attitude of just pretending to treat someone as worth talking to (for what purpose, I don't know - intellectual turf perhaps, as Edwards like to refer to sometimes?). It's a missreading on my part and genuine engagement on your part is involved?<br/><br/><br/>Tildesee,\n<blockquote>Ugh... It's not "if someone imagines things differently than you", it's "if everyone involved is being too unreasonable to compromise", and not "you don't get along with them," so much as "you aren't getting along with them". There's a really huge difference there that you're ignoring</blockquote>\nI get the idea was "you aren't getting along with them (at that point)" - that's what I was describing as being, at best, picky to describe it as not getting along based merely on a difference in imagination.<br/><br/>No one here is compromising - but <b>if</b> the thread had a set of rules one has to follow to post in it that included someone who is referee (has final say) and they said for this thread we'll treat the skill rules as an example of LD, then that's what people would go with (unless they just decide to ignore their commitment to the rules in this hypothetical situation).<br/><br/>Which works. You're own method is that when people have no final say person assigned and compromise is the only way to get anything to move forward, if they don't compromise then you aren't getting along with them. Doesn't that mean change the people (as I noted before)?<br/><br/>I guess my method does include its share of 'change the people' in that if they can't accept the final say rules, then they aren't accepted into that game. So I'll grant that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410334/#Comment_410334" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-24T16:39:42+00:00" title="March 24, 2013  4:39PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I hope I've missread that subtext and there's a genuine desire to engage,</blockquote>\nYou have misread.

That said, imagined space certainly exists in computer games, so if Callan does mean what you say, conta is still using hyperbole when he implies there might not be room for imagined space. <br/><br/>In terms of authority over rules disputes, I play with a group that is more likely to dispute the rules than dispute the GM. Taking people like me into account (this game is shit, we should fix it), the authority of rules as written is just as shaky as the authority of the GM in deciding the unspecified and which is taken more seriously depends on the RP culture you participate in. In my view, rules should be an agreement between participants. Fully specifying by a papal authority does nothing to secure agreement. In either case, the agreement is likely to be discursive and fluid. To resolve your disagreements, you must resolve your disagreements.

So why do you think the guy from my example will just argue forever?<br/><br/>The difference is here: when the text says who has the final say, the guy has agreed to that in advance of play (or otherwise he'd have declined to play).<br/><br/>When no final say is assigned and then some other person decides to self promote themselves to the final say position, which wasn't agreed to before play - it sucks. Why does that other guy get to self promote himself to a position without even asking if anyone else agrees to that?<br/><br/>Someone who'll concede to an assigned final say (or else they wouldn't have played) but will argue when there isn't one are not the same as someone who'll just argue regardless. If you're treating them both as the same, I'd have to leave it at saying I disagree that's the case. If you're saying it's only a 'always argue' guy and never one who'd follow rules on the final say if they were actually, you know, in the text, then I'd have to leave it as disagreeing with that. \n<blockquote>But imagine I'm with the person from your example, the person who is absolutely, 100% opposed to whatever I think and will never, ever compromise.</blockquote>\nThat example comes from talking with folks here - the moment someone here compromises a little away from 'hey, its all fine already', then the example is of someone less than 100% opposed.

So that's a start towards a compromise.<br/><br/>The rest of your comments seem to revolve around treating the 'argues when no final say is assigned and someone else self promotes themselves to final say position without asking permission' guy as being the same as the 'argues all the time regardless' guy.<br/><br/><br/>Gareth,\n<blockquote>I really do wonder whether RPG's as you see them even have any room for the imagined space at all. </blockquote>\nWell, if, for example, Tulpa's examples of handling skills seems to you to be the only way to include spoken fiction, I can understand why you think that when I talk about not doing it that way.<br/><br/>But if you think there's more than one way to include spoken fiction, I don't know why you're saying this?<br/><br/><br/>timonkey,\n<blockquote>Let me try again.

You said that board games with unclear or incomplete rules, which would be that way by accident, should have rules on who has authority over rules disputes.  But here you say that complete games do not.  But how can the author know for sure which case he is in?  He sets out to write a complete game, and accidentally misses something.  According to you, he's now missed two things, because there's no way to mediate the problems caused by his first mistake.  On the other hand, if an author includes rules on authority over rules disputes, in case some parts are unclear, whoever has that authority can use it to change the rules even if they were complete into different rules that they can use for their advantage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/czipeter" title="czipeter"><img alt="czipeter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/czipeter">czipeter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410461/#Comment_410461" name="Item_165" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-26T08:28:24+00:00" title="March 26, 2013  8:28AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            timonkey,<br/><br/>I think we agree that there is no such thing as a complete and total understanding (of the rules).

It is in fact the conventions of play and player-culture that decides who aims, by the way. The code does not care whether any aiming takes place at all. It merely projects a space conducive to it. There is an important sense in which software games do fully specify - based on any given valid input and state, there is a procedure for computing the next state that will be represented in the output media. Given a particular seed to the RNG, these transitions are deterministic in a fairly obvious way.<br/><br/>It should be fairly obvious that computer games do not specify user actions, user expectations, user culture, or user behaviour. But they do specify how the computer system responds to inputs, if in a dysfunctional manner at times.\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>Fully specifying by a papal authority does nothing to secure agreement. In either case, the agreement is likely to be discursive and fluid. To resolve your disagreements, you must resolve your disagreements. This has little to do with how specific rules are, or how they are written.</blockquote>\nI'm not sure if you're refering to fully specifying the final say - if you're saying even if the text assigns the final say that folk will ignore the call of the person with final say, then...that's just cheating.<br/><br/>Above I've granted what I'm talking about does in part involve 'change the people' - so in regard to this I would go into Accountingfortaste's 'don't play with these people' territory.<br/><br/>I'm just saying before I change the people, I try and make sure they aren't just arguing because the text doesn't assign final say (and someone at the table is trying to act like they've agreed to them having final say, when they know they haven't agreed to that). That can be cleared up (really easily). Cheating - no, just don't play with them or if one is inclined to, realise its dysfuctional play to continue it and continue.</blockquote>\nHaha. I don't think you understand. It's not that this ruins the game for anyone at all. The contract to disregard rules as written if they are agreed to be stupid or limiting underpins our play. Disputed changes deemed to be required for internal consistency come into effect in the next session. The status quo is that we immediately assign ourselves the ability to modify whatever we're playing however we feel like, GM usually having preference in terms of setting the tone, inventing the universe (moreso in single-GM universes). We don't cheat, but cheating is not defined by violating the rules as written, but rather by behaviour that ruins the game. Defects in the rules as written are patched when discovered, so there is little point in trying to cheat in this way anyhow. In short, the game is the master of its own destiny. I would really rather not play with people who don't do this, because it's what I'm used to, and because not being able to dispute rules that suck sounds lame. The rules can suggest authority, but ultimately, it's a hint for good practice.<br/><br/>If serial spine is not writing in an imperative procedural manner, fully specifying the internal mechanics of the game, or formally specifying authority, then it's Very Mysterious Indeed. Perhaps apprehending the difference between the good and proper construction of a game that really is an RPG and the foggy quagmire of lateral disconnect is lost on me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410512/#Comment_410512" name="Item_167" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-26T20:39:21+00:00" title="March 26, 2013  8:39PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 26, 2013 8:55PM by Callan_S.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            timonkey,\n<blockquote>Right, misreading rules is different than the rules not being complete.

Many times it's abstract so that a number of different sorts of things could control the game. Not that this fact is particularly relevant to the overall discussion. Additionally, (and this is slightly more relevant), often game programmers write our games with the intent that they will be modified for unknown purposes in the future by ourselves or others. We certainly don't have the power to specify in code who will aim. We only have the ability to try to produce the conventions of play, and to interact with the player-culture to shape their interpretation and use of the game. This can be through the software or otherwise. While in Counter Strike, most aiming is done by humans or aimbots, there is a totally legitimate (and kind of awesome) speedrunning culture around Ocarina of Time that doesn't follow the implied conventions of the game's plot at all. It's my view that it's an important humility for game developers to understand that your players create your games too, and not in a trivial way.<br/><br/>The more central point I was making there is that there is in fact a way in which computer games fully specify - they fully specify the internal physics of the game space. This is only relevant if SS is about full specification of the game's internal mechanics, though.\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>The contract to disregard rules as written if they are agreed to be stupid or limiting underpins our play.</blockquote>\nThe thing is, if you'd said to me you'd played chess - no qualifiers mentioned, but really you'd thrown out some 'stupid rules' from it, then unbeknownst to me I'd be having an intellectually dishonest conversation with you.

I have a feeling that some of the more emotionally challenging and disempowering games I have played fit into your LD category. IMO whether or not a group tends to play upbeat power fantasies or not tends to have a lot to do with whether or not that group has a lot of players who adore upbeat power fantasies and think other things are too hard / not fun. I guess that you can dismiss my claims about how individual games made me feel though! Or maybe I still haven't figured out the mysteries of your typology yet.<br/><br/>Also, I would be much more likely to tell you that I was playing an rpg my friend was running than that I was playing w/e rulebook we were using primarily. You seem to think that the culture of written rules takes precedence over an oral tradition of play. I think that that's a flawed view, speaking of someone that tends to play first and write the rules based on the agreed play. (Although if I recall correctly SG in general hates this process for some reason.)<br/><br/>Do you have a problem with measuring success based on whether or not the group deemed the game successful? If so, how should we be measuring our success? \n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>If serial spine is not writing in an imperative procedural manner, fully specifying the internal mechanics of the game, or formally specifying authority</blockquote>\nNot sure why you raise this if statement as if it's relevant?

I went to the following site:<br/><a href="http://www.d20srd.org/index.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.d20srd.org/index.htm</a><br/>  And looked at the skills in question. Now, reading the descriptions for Climb and Diplomacy, it makes it pretty clear that you cannot use Diplomacy to climb a well and/or cliff.<br/>  However, I did notice two things:<br/>1) There is no text telling a GM when to call for a roll in the SRD. In fact, I couldn't find any GM advice (maybe the SRD assumes the DM has a DMG?).<br/>2) There are areas of ambiguity which would require interpretation. Look at the descriptions for Ride and Handle Animal. Here they "try" to differentiate these Skills, but I can easily see checks for one being applied to checks for the other.<br/>  And there is no text to tell you who decides who is right or when it is really needed at all. And furthermore, there is not a good advice as to when/how often these skills should be called for. There is nothing to prevent the GM from creating an Adventure where the PCs cannot proceed until they make a DC30 Craft Skill check. this is obviously bad gaming, but it is supported by the rules and a DM would be within his rights to do just that. I honestly feel like the game text can't fix bad gamers. But in this case, the DM might not be a bad gamer, he just wouldn't know it was a bad idea until he tried it or came across that advice.<br/><br/>  Callan has a good point, unfortunately, he is relying on the reader's ability to infer a LOT of information from his posts. It wasn't until halfway through the second page of posts that I even knew what he was talking about.<br/>  I think that the pervasive culture of assuming that the reader understands what a Skill is, what it represents in the setting/game world and when it should/shouldn't be rolled is an example of how dysfunctional gaming happens. And to be honest, I think many gamers have had that moment where the GM says "make a climb check" and your reply is "can I use Acrobatics?" In most groups, the GM will think about it and make a ruling. But, that should be in the rules and a ruling shouldn't be required, should it?<br/><br/>  Callan, correct me if I am wrong, but I think I get what you are saying now and I think it is a GREAT point to make.<br/>Dave M<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410629/#Comment_410629" name="Item_170" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T18:27:51+00:00" title="March 27, 2013  6:27PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>  And there is no text to tell you who decides who is right or when it is really needed at all.

A bad way to imagine.<br/><br/>We tell them it's about their imagination. Then we tell them their imagination is wrong - it's bad/'it's a bad idea'. But then we have game books which don't tell them what they can do/are LD and allow a DC30 craft check, and in doing so we give the message it's okay. Then come play, we say it's bad.<br/><br/>It's an awful culture of cross messages. It's poisonous.<br/><br/>All stamping on what, while they might be kooky imaginations, are perfectly valid imaginations! Oddball imaginations are a good thing! It's actually okay to imagine starting with a DC30 craft skill - but which gamer veterans here would imagine such a thing? You wouldn't because you've been trained to think it's bad gaming - and why have you been trained to think it's bad gaming? Because since the game text doesn't force you to use a DC range of, say for example, 10 to 18, instead your imagination has been battered into the shape of 10 to 18 by various negative feedbacks (or reading about various negative feedbacks (what you call 'advice')).\n<blockquote>I think that the pervasive culture of assuming that the reader understands what a Skill is, what it represents in the setting/game world and when it should/shouldn't be rolled is an example of how dysfunctional gaming happens.

All you have is one person thinking how they imagine it is the rules, and in doing so stomping on the other persons imagination. It's poisonous. It's the very antithesis of a game about imagination.<br/><br/>I say protect imagination, by recognising where you've been left with absolutely no rules on a matter - the DC30 craft check is fine because of the lack of rules, the diplomacy to climb a cliff example is fine because of a lack of rules. The other person is not doing it wrong, they are not imagining it wrong, the rules just give sweet FA restriction on the matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410631/#Comment_410631" name="Item_171" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T18:29:37+00:00" title="March 27, 2013  6:29PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the SRD lacks instructions for all sorts of things.

That the adventure cannot continue until a PC passes a DC30 crafting check. I could have gone with the more obvious Spot check, but in a Pathfinder/D&amp;D group, not many PCs are likely to have Crafting and depending on their levels, they probably might not have enough Crafting to pass a DC30 check.<br/>  But, until the DM makes this adventure, and it fails horribly, this information may not be intuitive, obvious or even properly understood by the novice GM. Sure, this is fixable, but it is an example of why we need rules telling the GM what they can't do, when to call for a check, what kinds of checks are appropriate, etc. I am sure this is covered in the DMG to some extent, but I am equally sure that there is not text forbidding a DM from calling for an impossible skill check before the adventure can proceed. Don't get me wrong, these high DC numbers are appropriate to the setting, genre and fiction of the world and play at the table. But if play cannot proceed until an impossible roll is required, something has gone wrong. The designers of these games know that this is not a good idea, but that knowledge is sometimes not encoded in the rules. And many times bad play is not disallowed by the DM.<br/>  I think its a problem, I think it is solvable and I think it is a good idea to address it in future designs.<br/>  I don't know if I would use such a hyperbolic statement as to say it is poisonous, but I would go so far as to say that this sort of rules structure has ruined some games for me on more than one occasion. And from what I know of my fellow gamers, I think this is a scenario that other GMs and players have experienced. Whether or not it ruined their play experience will vary wildly, but I know that this is a real issue we can solve.<br/>Dave M<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410723/#Comment_410723" name="Item_177" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-28T16:45:42+00:00" title="March 28, 2013  4:45PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 28, 2013 4:46PM by JDCorley.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm trying to think of a situation where "play could not proceed" based on a failed skill check of any kind in a D&amp;D or Pathfinder game, because TPKs are completely fine in both those games, but if that situation would be bad for a particular group, which I can imagine, either we can adjust the game text to solve that problem for that particular group (proceduralize it), or encourage that group to adjust their game to their taste (push the 'play as creative act' interpretation of the traditional RPG), but I don't see one approach as being inherently better than the other.

If we tease it apart a bit... <br/>- Why did the GM have a DC 30 check if that wasn't to his taste already? It's already to his taste.<br/>- If the game was written with the intention it's for the groups taste, why is the text supposedly saying the GM controls this (rather than say some kind of vote system - perhaps like universalis has?). If it's for the groups tastes, it's giving the wrong message. Poor wording.<br/>- And what happens if you push the play as creative act and...the GM (pretty much in line with the text about 'who's in charge') says no? Push harder?<br/><br/>The group creative, in as much as it's in peril of simply being told 'no', really isn't supported by the text. That's pretty much why some groups avoid the text like the plague and declare proudly about how they didn't roll all night.<br/><br/>I hesitate to mention that what's often treated as a supposed counter weight to being told no is that the group implies they will cease playing under that GM.<br/><br/>Too much walking on egg shells, by my measure.

I think one could gun for social bargaining as the main catalyst of play - that'd be okay, if when the other person adheres to the message the rules gave him, it's not treated as being unable to collaborate with them but instead you want to punt it up to social bargaining and they want to follow the message the rule give.

So here's my solution. I present to you my work:<br/><br/><b><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rightly And Properly Using Sense Motive To Climb A Cliff: The Definitive Guide By Biggles</span></b><br/><br/>1. Brew a very strong, magically enhanced psychoactive potion over the course of a very long time. The effects of the potion are to place the user face to face with the universe itself, represented as a highly conversant four-year-old holding a samurai sword.<br/>2. Cripes, what goes on in this alarmingly dangerous conversation is somehow transformed into movements of the drinker's body. The place in the conversation corresponds to the drinker's situation. The cliff is a tantrum. Somehow, placating the child will enable you to navigate the cliff-face. If only you knew what it wanted.<br/>3. Sense motive. (N.b. I don't actually know what this skill is for b/c we don't have it in our games. I'm assuming that you can use it to detect the nature of a tornado-katana-tantrum.)<br/>4. Goddamn that's a high cliff, how did I get here? What's wrong with kids these days?<br/><br/>I also thought of one where the cliff just had a face and you had to figure out whether it was trustworthy, but it wasn't as funny and didn't involve having Sense Motive boost your actual climbing skills.

Something along the lines that wrecking the game is just wrecking the game and your position is there is no other different version of wrecking the game which occurs because of a cross message (just trying to put it in my own words here).<br/><br/>My position is that sometimes/many times, actually a cross message is the problem.<br/><br/><br/>Biggles/AFT,<br/>My own idea was that the cliff was an earth elemental and you needed to be nice to it to be able to get up it (which I made up <i>after</i> thinking of sense motive/diplomacy to climb a cliff). All the imaginary ideas in your examples seem cool and valid. Once you accept the unconventional connections that are possible, it can be a source of creativity, exemplified by your examples. I'd describe the traditonal RPG's skill system as lateral dislocate, in that yeah, you could call for any skill (or none at all), but if unconventional connections are accepted rather than treated as wrecking the game, I think that works out. Try and treat it as if only certain skills can be used at certain times, and you get into trouble given the LD structure.\n<blockquote>isn't not having impassible walls common sense?</blockquote>\nDepends on how much you think imagination works by common sense? I think if imagination worked purely by common sense*, then there would be no magic imagined, no monsters imagined - infact, not even any fictional people or fictional objects imagined. It depends how much you bring common sense into imagination - and if someone else brings it in less, are they wrong to do so and you're right?<br/><br/>When I wrote diary of a skull soldier I put in some RL time limits, to avoid any particular imaginary act just dragging things on - which is similar to stopping a GM who requires a DC 30 craft roll (or he'll do nothing) drags things on. To me it was common sense as well - so much so I could write common sense down as a rule. If common sense is so clear, why can't we write it down? If we can't, perhaps things aren't so clear until they are written down?<br/><br/>* Watching the simulationist culture over the years in forums, it's interesting how they've gone from a 'common sense' motif to a 'genre emulation' motif. I think over the years they kinda figured they were undermining their own imaginations to fetish common sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biggles" title="biggles"><img alt="biggles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biggles">biggles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410882/#Comment_410882" name="Item_187" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-30T16:31:17+00:00" title="March 30, 2013  4:31PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2013 4:31PM by biggles.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, if you were making Kafka's Before The Law into a game, you might want a bunch of impassible checks to lie between the player and their ultimate goal.

In my view, it would be more elegant to have a resolution system that entirely precludes any checks that will inherently never make sense than banning them.

Say a document only contains a resolution system. If people use those rules, the part of their scenario design that's being done by the rules is that the resolution system used is the one in the rules. Not much, but it's something, and it will alter the feel of the game. It's my guess that we're roughly on the same page in that respect - we view abstract rules as contributing to scenario design.<br/><br/>In some cases, the end user will be a GM, who works straight from the rules and improvs through anything unspecified. In other cases, the end user will be a designer (possibly also a GM), who takes the rules given and builds more game text and rules on top of them. (And then uses them as above or distributes them or both.) Different rules will specify more or less of the game activity. I don't have any particular feeling about rules that specify more or rules that specify less. It is my personal taste to specify as late (in the design process) as possible, however, because unnecessary constraints may bite me in the ass down the line. I also like to avoid binding components together until I absolutely have to because it makes it easier to lift them out and use them elsewhere, or see how the game would look with a part removed. I certainly don't think that everyone should think how I think, though. I think like a particular kind of software designer. People should do what works for them.<br/><br/>If a ruleset has an extremely laborious and highly obfuscated system for encounters/conflicts/etc (hi dnd) then it's gonna be bad to leave encounter design up to GMs. It's probably also gonna be a bad idea to leave running encounters up to the GM. Maybe playing the characters should be left to those who understand the system. Computer programs, for example. More legible rules might actually help users create &amp; design their own scenarios rather than present them with mind-numbing elementary math problems. In the world at large, scenario design is left to somebody. As I don't think that scenario design is particularly hard providing the designer has a good vocabulary of game construction techniques and knows what they want to do, I think it's fine to leave it up to whoever the end user might be. If I am the end user of my own rules, so be it. Why treat users of rules as if they are less capable of scenario design than makers of rules? If it's hard for other people to grasp design in your framework, isn't that problematic in itself?<br/><br/>For me it's not so much a question of to what extent the game designers do the scenario design (they certainly contribute in varying degrees), but a question of to what extent the GMs and players are the real game designers. I tend to think that in games (including software ones), the micro and nano level design/construction is as important as the high-level conceptual design. Although bad conceptual tools or theory can easily throw a whole work, alone they are nothing, and bad nano/micro can ruin the whole thing too.<br/><br/>So yeah. In my opinion, it's good to leave users of rules room to fail. Game designers enjoy the same freedom, after all. Not doing so is also fine.<br/><br/>edit: oops longpost.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410938/#Comment_410938" name="Item_190" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-31T16:39:21+00:00" title="March 31, 2013  4:39PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think that in many cases, the scenario design should be left to the user of the rules. </blockquote>\nDoes that mean you think dogs in the vineyard, 3:16, capes, spione and my life with master do not have any amount of the scenario written by the game designer into the system?\n<blockquote>Why treat users of rules as if they are less capable of scenario design than makers of rules?</blockquote>\nThat's like saying if someone sells cakes, it's treating buyers as if they are less capable of baking cakes.<br/>(the cake in this example refers to a <i>partially </i>made cake, most of the base is done, but icing, any filling, etc can be added by the end user)<br/><br/>It's nice to eat a cake someone else (atleast partially) made instead of just ones you made entirely yourself.

Given that immediately after that quote, I made an argument (which I expected you might agree with) that pretty much every RPG rule implicitly does some scenario design, I probably do think that they do scenario design. Based on what I know about those games, they probably do more scenario design for the GM (and more explicitly contribute to scenario design, including tone hints) than something like FUDGE or GURPS or Locus.\n<blockquote><br/>That's like saying if someone sells cakes, it's treating buyers as if they are less capable of baking cakes.<br/>(the cake in this example refers to a <i>partially </i>made cake, most of the base is done, but icing, any filling, etc can be added by the end user)<br/><br/>It's nice to eat a cake someone else (atleast partially) made instead of just ones you made entirely yourself. It doesn't make you less of a cook to do so. That's no lie.<br/></blockquote>\nThe thing about cakes is that baking them is a non-reversible operation. If you were to ask me if I preferred a cake that was sold with its recipe to a cake that's sold alone, I'd strongly prefer the cake with the recipe. Even better would be a recipe with a conceptual explanation of the recipe creation process. In terms of this analogy, though, I'm not arguing that nobody should sell any cake. I'm arguing that free distribution of partial recipes is a decent and useful practice. So what if my roux recipe doesn't tell you not to put it in baked beans? I don't think that this makes it a bad roux recipe. Although. Lesson from my flatting life that other people may not be stupid enough to need: don't put roux in baked beans.<br/><br/>The cake thing is also a bit of a misleading analogy, though, because a cake can be eaten and appreciated with no particular assistance, whereas an RPG requires a group to interpret and run it. There is interpretation in cake-eating but not usually of the same kind.\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>So yeah.

A car required parts to run and kills people or does nothing if it does not work correctly. An RPG can be played with no written rules, and will merely embarrass, confuse, or bore people if it works wrong. Unless it goes REALLY wrong. But that's not gonna happen just because some mechanical rule wasn't included. Also, cars do allow users room to fail, hence the rather popular activity of crashing cars into each other and getting very hurt. Not that I am a fan of this. But motorsport fans might not enjoy systems that don't put drivers in full control of the vehicle. Cars don't say "you can crash your car", because it is a well known fact that driving is a skill that people learn to be competent at. Roleplaying is not as popular as driving cars, but it has always been my understanding that GMing a game and playing in a game are skills that people learn to use and grow over time. Games are known to fail depending on the competency of the group at these various skills. If a game gives even more room to fail than is the norm then sure, it might be nice to give notice. Or if you're selling it for some reason. But unlike car manufacture, the production of roleplaying game rules is not always centred around their use as a saleable commodity. Like recipes or software, they can be exchanged amongst peers with no warranty except to the minimum extent required by applicable law, and no thought for customer experience. I don't think that carefully commodified rules are any better than less commodified ones. If your target audience doesn't see GMing and playing as skills that help make a successful game, then you should probably put a warning or explanation.

They just pursue different goals.<br/><br/>Not to mention, if we're really going to say "these texts are damaging" when we're talking about the most popular texts in the hobby, shouldn't we see way more damage? Somewhere? </blockquote>\nOK,<br/>RE: I'm trying to think of a situation where "play could not proceed" based on a failed skill check<br/>  But if we look at other posts on SG, you can see examples of just hat in CoC posts as well as other games. DC 30 Craft in a D&amp;D game is an extreme example, but a DC30 Spot Check to spot the clue that allows you to go to the next scene is a more common issue. What happens when every member of the party fails? The rules might describe how to decide when to roll, they might describe what happens when you fail. But they rarely go to the point of denying the GM the ability to shut down their entire adventure by requiring success on a particular action before the adventure can continue.<br/>  Of course, a GM will eventually learn to stop doing that. But if the Designers already know this is a bad idea, why not write a rule forbidding the GM from asking for this check. Not a rule that says "don't call for a Skill Check that can never succeed" (although that is not a bad rule necessarily), but more like "Do not create a scenario in which play cannot continue until an impossible task is completed" rule. It seems obvious, but I know I flubbed this up when first GMing and I imagine others did too.<br/><br/> I don't think this is an issue with inheriting previous design sensibilities. I don't think this is a case of asking a designer to try to map all the possible combinations. This is just a symptom of the culture assuming everyone will houserule a game, do it correctly and work through/around these common problems based on their own experiences. And if you are an experienced GM, eventually, you develop just such a toolkit that you use to deal with common isues.<br/><br/>RE: adjust their game to their taste<br/>  Sure, for many games, they need to be adjusted to taste. How do you do that? Again, if the game is playtested, you can answer that question as a designer. Otherwise, you are leaving gamers to somehow discover how to do this in every game they learn. You can't encode all of the designer's knowledge into a game, but you can encode the parts that you tweak to get different kinds of fun, right? And if you know there are actions/rules mods that are just un-fun, why not just disallow those actions?<br/><br/>RE: shouldn't we see way more damage?<br/>  Again, I wouldn't go so far to say these texts are poison, etc. But, I would go so far as to say that I have had my own fun ruined and I know of other players who have had their fun ruined by a Rules As Written legal action performed by another player or GM that could have been prevented with a slight rules tweak. My sample is not huge, but does it have to be? I don't think this is an unreasonable request. Write rules preventing the GM, or any player for that matter, from doing something that ruins the fun. If you keep it in terms of the Rules As Written, you don't have to worry about creating rules to manage the players at the table, just the characters and their fictional actions. If you look at D&amp;D or Pathfinder, they have rules for saving movement points from turn to turn, standing on the sides/intersections of squares and hexes. Why not the same rules for skill checks, declaring actions/reactions, etc? When is it legal to use Diplomacy to scale a cliff? When is it illegal? Players can come up with justifications for anything in a fictional universe, what is the limit?<br/><br/>  I get what you are saying JD. It is impossible for a game designer to encode the entirety of their knowledge of a game into a given rulebook. And even harder than that to regulate play outside of the shared adventure at the table. But I do not think it is unreasonable to expect that bad game play can be pointed out or even prohibited in the rules.

I suspect this is where the actual challenge lies.<br/><br/>Here's my first stab at it:<br/><br/><b>Your character has three possible destinations, each at a different distance, each addressing a different need, each offering a different reward.  (A) has your sick mother and a fearsome trumpet and is 17 km away, (B) has your kingdom's battle line and a sacred chalice and is 14 km away, (C) has your temple and a healing potion and is 20 km away.<br/><br/>For every 6 miles you travel, roll 1d6 + (total number of miles / 6).  On a 6: without the potion, your mom dies; without the trumpet, your kingdom is breached; without the chalice, your god abandons you.<br/><br/>Each time you reach a destination (A, B, or C), your hit points return to full.<br/><br/>Choose which destinations to seek in which order.<br/><br/>If you have not died, the game ends when you reach your third destination.<br/><br/>Otherwise, play as Callan described.</b><br/><br/>Now we have a game where a player can invest in the fiction because their decisions affect it.<br/><br/><b>In order to earn +2 from the GM, narrate something that they enjoy hearing.</b><br/><br/>Now we have a game where fiction can be narrated with purpose.<br/><br/>If I'm a good entertainer, that helps my odds at the dice game, which helps my odds of getting the fictional results I wanted.<br/><br/>The GM still doesn't do anything with the fiction, though, except give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down.  No RPG fun for them.  We need to fix that.  If we can fix it so that the GM and I are being creative in tandem, rather than separately, that would be better still.  In fact, that may be an absolute requirement.<br/><br/>The final thing I might require is "reading the fiction".<br/><br/>Oh, and there's also the issue of having some non-mechanical basis for prioritizing mom / kingdom / god, so as to inform whether reaching the end alive counts as "winning".<br/><br/>That's all I've got for now; hopefully, more later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411020/#Comment_411020" name="Item_196" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-01T18:21:59+00:00" title="April  1, 2013  6:21PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 1, 2013 6:23PM by JDCorley.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>OK,<br/>RE: I'm trying to think of a situation where "play could not proceed" based on a failed skill check<br/>  But if we look at other posts on SG, you can see examples of just hat in CoC posts as well as other games.

Most D&amp;D mystery scenarios (they do exist) and virtually all Call of Cthulhu scenarios have "here's what happens if the party fails completely, or checks out of the mystery before it's solved" text. Like I say, I can envision groups for which this is a bad ending that nobody likes, and we can either proceduralize the rules to make sure those groups never get into a bad situation, or we can say some groups should adjust the rules to their tastes and the rest just proceed with it since they're fine with a TPK or the bad guy taking over the area, or the goblins eating Farmer Brown or whatever the stakes of the adventure are.\n<blockquote>  Again, I wouldn't go so far to say these texts are poison, etc. But, I would go so far as to say that I have had my own fun ruined and I know of other players who have had their fun ruined by a Rules As Written legal action performed by another player or GM that could have been prevented with a slight rules tweak.

Have you not experienced this?  I think you sort of admit you did - just above, do you think that player or GM was <i>dissatisfied</i> with the action they took that you didn't like?  If so, why did they do something they didn't want to do?<br/><br/>A game that proceduralizes-away game play you consider bad leaves no room for differences of taste.  One reason D&amp;D has been so successful over its many editions and may years is because it's <i>very flexible</i> and lots of groups can do lots of different things with it.  (This is actually true for all financially successful games in the RPG hobby so far.)  And yes, they actually contain tons of advice on how to make play good for your group.  (Callan thinks we can delete that advice/instruction completely from the text without affecting play. Maybe he is right, but I don't know how we could ever test that.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411023/#Comment_411023" name="Item_197" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-01T19:16:50+00:00" title="April  1, 2013  7:16PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi David,<br/><br/>Yeah, an issue with traveling is that once you've gone to the effort of establishing an imaginary scene, once travel occurs again you're sort of obliged to wipe the slate clean as the character has moved away from the previous scene and you need to establish a new one.<br/><br/>I'm thinking maybe make it a horse and cart/caravan thing, with 2D4 individuals traveling with the PC.<br/><br/>In regard to this, my original SS examples issue is pretty much is about survival. Whilst your games issue seems to be about three competing disasters. I'd even think about cutting the monster fights entirely and have the +2 be to the travel roll itself, adding extra distance - also, so it's not undercutting the players efforts, when we divide the roll by 6 to determine the number of dice (if I'm reading you right, that's what you do) we don't include any +2 bonuses to distance gained over the course of the journey.<br/><br/>Then the GM can work out the cart, it's defects, the horse/donkey, it's tempriment, the NPC's and their attitudes. I'd hinge the +2 around conversations and interactions with those people and keeping the cart moving, all of which involves a back and forth with the GM. I have a few notions of rules in regard to that, to keep it neat.<br/><br/>Also I don't quite understand this part\n<blockquote>On a 6: without the potion, your mom dies; without the trumpet, your kingdom is breached; without the chalice, your god abandons you.</blockquote>\nALL of these things happen on a six on any of the dice rolled?

It may be that only the last one is important:<br/><br/><b>1)</b> Oops, I wrote the rule out poorly.  What I meant was that each subsequent roll gets harder.  After 6 km, roll 1d6; disaster strikes on a 6.  After 12 total km, roll 1d6 again; disaster strikes on a 5+.  18 km = 4+, etc.<br/><br/>Those numbers are probably awful; to be honest, I didn't spend any thought on that (nor on which disaster occurs on a bad roll).  My only intent was to give the player a choice (and ability to pursue a goal) that's <i>about the fiction</i>.  In this case, it's "is it most important to you to (a) save mom, (b) save kingdom, (c) save faith, or (d) save as many of them as possible?"<br/><br/>That's all I care about.  <br/><br/>I assume we can tweak the math until the rules actually make that functional.  Start with 12 on a d12; when disaster strikes, flip a coin to see which of the <i>destinations you're not en route to</i> gets hit.  Or something.  I'm not inclined to worry about it as long as we agree that it can be made to work without much trouble.<br/><br/><b>2) </b>You're right, the game could be streamlined by rolling for travel speed rather than worrying about fights.  However, I was hoping that the threat of death being more likely on one route (20 km) than another (14 km) would make the decision of destination order more interesting than simply going "first, favorite; second, middle; third, least favorite."  Do you maximize your chance of living to have a shot at saving all three?  Or do you just make sure to save your favorite, even if that means you might never get to the 2nd or 3rd?<br/><br/>Hmm, maybe I need to change a rule for that:<br/><br/><b>Each time you reach a destination (A, B, or C), your hit points return to one less than their previous refresh.  10 to start, then 9 after the first destination, 8 after the second destination.</b><br/><br/>Again, all I'm trying to do here is take the decision about "where do I go now?" and give it the power to impact the fiction in different ways depending on what the player chooses.<br/><br/><b>3) </b>When you describe the +2 hinging on a player-GM back-and-forth concerning the fiction, this is where I think we get more of the type of play that tends to (a) make roleplaying fun and (b) screw up the elegance of a mechanical system.  So I'd love to hear your rules notions for that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411049/#Comment_411049" name="Item_199" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-02T00:41:50+00:00" title="April  2, 2013 12:41AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's okay with the numbers - just plug something in and playtest, it's fine!\n<blockquote>flip a coin to see which of the destinations you're not en route to gets hit.</blockquote>\nAh, right, thought it might be that, but couldn't be sure!

Oh - I retract what I said about removing the monster fights! I can see that tying in now. Actually - do you have to do all three things, or could you say, do just one or two and then say 'no, that's enough!'. Also just a small thing, but does the player have to decide the order in advance? Couldn't they just pick one, then choose from the remainder after? That still works if someone wants to decide them all in advance, but it includes someone who wants to feel the moment and decide from that, after completing a journey.<br/><br/>I like the lowering of max HP! It sort of ties in the idea of HP attrition, without it being overly swingy in how much attrition is or isn't there. Seems a smart design move!\n<blockquote>3) When you describe the +2 hinging on a player-GM back-and-forth concerning the fiction, this is where I think we get more of the type of play that tends to (a) make roleplaying fun and (b) screw up the elegance of a mechanical system.

For instance, it's not too hard to roughly measure the number of sentences the player speaks (and give the requirement the sentence has to be, say, four words or more). The idea is to make a complimentry system - sure, the GM can grant the +2, but lets say the player has put in the effort of giving four sentences (which shows they are engaging with the whole thing). Maybe if they have done that many, they can roll a special 1D6 and if it's 3-5 they get a bonus of +1, if it's a 6 they get +2.<br/><br/>I suggest this in because I kinda like to measure player effort in addition to ability to engage the GM.<br/><br/>On top of that I'd suggest putting a time limit on these elements of five minutes or so. This is for when the game is not about chewing the GM's ear for however long it takes for him to cave in and give the bonus.<br/><br/>But these ideas perhaps are quite idiosyncratic to me - you're idea with HP is cool and my ideas might get in the way of the expression of your own method.<br/><br/>I'm kinda excited to see more, David!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411318/#Comment_411318" name="Item_200" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-04T15:30:03+00:00" title="April  4, 2013  3:30PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 4, 2013 3:30PM by David_Berg.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Establishing a required minimum (if you want the +2) for the amount of narration is a novel idea.  We could also introduce other speech requirements, like "ask at least one relevant question".<br/><br/>However, I'm not quite seeing anything to incentivize the player-GM back-and-forth you described:\n<blockquote>Then the GM can work out the cart, it's defects, the horse/donkey, it's tempriment, the NPC's and their attitudes. I'd hinge the +2 around conversations and interactions with those people and keeping the cart moving, all of which involves a back and forth with the GM. I have a few notions of rules in regard to that, to keep it neat.</blockquote>\nThe most familiar incentive to play that way, in my experience, is this:<br/><br/><b>The GM is the judge of <i>what would work</i>.  By interacting with the scene the GM imagines, the player can get a glimpse into the GM's mind and maximize their chances of doing <i>what would work</i>.</b><br/><br/>So, the GM's rationale behind giving or denying the +2 (once the minimum sentence requirement is met, if we use that) would be "Do I think the narrated action would work particularly well?"<br/><br/>Is that what you had in mind?<br/><br/>- If not, what were you thinking instead?<br/><br/>- If so, I think that leads to punching holes in the serial spine.  I'll explain why, if it applies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18091/serial-spine-vs-lateral-dislocate/p3" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18091/serial-spine-vs-lateral-dislocate">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18091/serial-spine-vs-lateral-dislocate/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18091/serial-spine-vs-lateral-dislocate/p3" rel="prev">3</a><a class="Highlight p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18091/serial-spine-vs-lateral-dislocate/p4">4</a><a class=" p-5 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18091/serial-spine-vs-lateral-dislocate/p5" rel="next">5</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18091/serial-spine-vs-lateral-dislocate/p5" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F18091%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F18091%2Fx%2Fp4%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Serial Spine Vs Lateral Dislocate - Page 5 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18091/serial-spine-vs-lateral-dislocate/p5" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Serial Spine Vs Lateral Dislocate - Page 5" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18091/serial-spine-vs-lateral-dislocate/p5" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="- If so, I think that leads to punching holes in the serial spine.

But it seems to me that there's an opposition there, an opposition between "treat the fiction as real" and "only interact with it from the perspective of a game goal".  Can we <i>really</i> look to the fiction <i>only</i> for certain things?<br/><br/><b>Example: </b><br/>The GM describes the nearby river, the large wooden cart, burlap bags, donkeys, and the cart driver's colorful regional attire with its tribal identifier.  The player decides they hate the denoted tribe, so they want to kidnap the driver, carve the cart into a raft, use the bags and donkey skins for sails, and take off down the river to persuade a competing tribe to help them, offering the captive driver as proof of their allegiance.  The player's hope then is that their new allies can deliver the potion to the distant sick mother (location A), leaving them plenty of turns to deal with the other two nearby crises (B and C).  <br/><br/>The GM can either <b>(a)</b> say "cool, I like it" and allow the rest of the game to be a cakewalk where the mechanics no longer contribute, <b>(b)</b> say "that's not allowed in this game" and ruin the player's engagement with the fiction, <b>(c)</b> try to pass (b) off as "that wouldn't work in the fiction" (which never ends happily), or <b>(d)</b> attempt an unbiased judgment of how the player's actions would pan out, letting it end however it ends, even if that be something that ruins the game (like a cakewalk or certain doom).<br/><br/>None of that sounds serial spine-friendly to me, so I'm guessing we need to prevent the player from ever having such an "Oh, I have a unique idea for what I can do!" reaction.  But if we prevent <i>that</i>, is there any point in roleplaying?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411348/#Comment_411348" name="Item_203" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-05T02:36:56+00:00" title="April  5, 2013  2:36AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2013 2:38AM by Callan_S.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, so far your games questions/player choices seem to have been morally based - do you put your mother ahead of your religion, for example.<br/><br/>If you wanted to argue the +2 should, <i>in theme with that</i>, revolve around moral choices - like whether you whip the donkey until it bleeds or not, I think you have a valid point.<br/><br/>But your question seems to be, if we don't roleplay incoherantly, ie slewing across 'treating the fiction as real', 'playing to get to a game goal' and 'approaching tricky moral choices', is there any point to roleplaying at all?<br/><br/>Is your example player interested in moral quandries? Is he interested in this games <i>particular</i> moral quandries?<br/><br/>If he's not, well, that's most of your problem right there!<br/><br/>If he is interested in the moral quandries THIS game presents, why's he trying to dodge the game? Maybe he didn't realise it'd dodge the game that he actually wants to play - if so, that isn't a big issue, just tell him his fiction doesn't lead to facing the moral problems of this game (the problems we presume he wants to face). Also just no, you can't - the rules don't let you (OMG, RPG blasphemy!) - the rules don't let you because they are actually PART of the moral problem to be presented. To ignore them is to ignore the touchy moral ground this game is about. If you want to ignore it, just don't play. I can easily think up fiction where it's still up to him to travel the path - but as I said before, if this player just isn't interested in moral quandries, then he isn't interested in a game about them!<br/><br/>I mean, I've run into this - I remember pitching (out of game) a hypothetical about whether to steal medical supplies or let a sick village have them for free. My friends eyes suddenly light up, how he'd sell the supplies to the village! Oh, win, win! Well, not really - it was a gamist dodge of the question. He couldn't stomach thinking of a situation where you are stuck with just two lousy choices, so he makes up a new situation (one where he can sell) and ignores the situation I gave. <br/><br/>Also once in a game I gave a pretty light moral choice as in someone who looked mildly suspicious was on the other side of a crowd, and about to leave - the PC would have to barrel through the crowd, knocking people down, to get to this person who might not even matter. The player proceded to try and state he used his characters drug enhanced strength to pick people up and pop them out of the way, to get through in time...<br/><br/>I'm sure there are some folk reading this who love that. That's fine, but it's ignoring the situation I pitched - which was where you have two kinda sucky choices. Make a choice. You can't win and...if it seems shit that you can't win, then fair enough, the games not for you.<br/><br/>So I'd pitch it the other way around - if your game is about <i>particular </i>moral problems - is there any point roleplaying if you're going to just go along with people ignoring it all?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411350/#Comment_411350" name="Item_204" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-05T04:31:22+00:00" title="April  5, 2013  4:31AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2013 4:45AM by David_Berg.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you just dodged the issues by positing a game that's about one thing.<br/><br/>If I told you, "Here's a game about a moral quandary!" would you say, "I'm in!"?  Of course not.  You'd want to know whether it's a board game or a contact sport or theater improv.  You'd want to know what you'll get to do -- run, act, or talk?  You'd want to know what skills are engaged -- do you think creatively, strategically, or socially?<br/><br/>My example game here is about <b>moral choice as acted upon strategically, explored through the medium of roleplay</b>.  That <i>whole thing</i> is the appealing package; no part of that is a mere means to an end.<br/><br/>So, if you're a player who wants <i>all of those things</i>, and you get to the moment in my last example where you have a neat idea about making your donkey-hide boat, what are your options?  <br/><br/>If you veer off on the boat, you're exploring through roleplay, but you may lose the moral choice and game-mechanical strategy.  <br/><br/>If you decline to go boating, then you keep the moral choice and strategy, but are you still exploring through roleplay?  Or are you just tacking roleplay onto a board game, such that, y'know, why bother?  I'd really like to hear what you think about this.

The GM has not backup plan and thing get awkward. I have done this, and I know of two other GMs who have done this to me. this is bad play. This isn't a matter of taste. This is 'the whole thing stops until the GM can figure out how to recover.'<br/>  There are other examples of bad play I can come up with where everyone was playing according to the rules but no one had fun. these situations are repeatable and not usually a matter of taste. For instance that is why I didn't mention TPK, because some people don't mind it. You are right, if the difference is just a matter of taste, then by all means, do what you like. But there are things that are universally un-fun. For instance sitting around while the GM wades through the rule book or sitting around waiting for the GM to come up with a way to set the next scene or bring in a new character.

To me, when you say "if the player is torn between two core components of the pitched game, that's not a bad player, that's bad rules design." you nail it - as in trying to have 'em all is bad rules design.<br/><br/>But okay, you think you can have them all and SS is maybe getting in the way of that.<br/><br/>Whilst I think you can't have them all (working from the idea the human mind does one (primarily) at a time) and SS is just forcing you to make a choice about which agenda comes first, while LD just lets you humm and harr and waffle amongst a tradition of incoherant RPG's.

I admit my donkey-boating example isn't the greatest.  I just wish you were trying a little harder to understand what I meant by "have them all" rather that sticking with an interpretation wherein that's obviously crazy.  I agree with you, you cannot play against your character values to win Dogs.  I think it would obviously be stupid try, which is why I find your interpretation uncharitable.  That's not what I'm talking about.  Instead I'm talking about Dogs in the Vineyard <i>exactly as it is</i>.  It's a game about moral choices, wherein the players employ strategy to pursue their goals.  It could be a board game, but instead it's an RPG.  It delivers an experience designed for people who like <i>moral strategic roleplay</i>.  That's all I'm talking about here, when I say "have them all".<br/><br/>If you want to say that in <i>Dogs</i> moral choice is primary, strategy's secondary, roleplay is tertiary, then fine, whatever, as long as you agree that they're all vital and <i>Dogs</i> wouldn't be what it is without all of them.<br/><br/>Sorry if my example of donkey-boating was a bad example.  All I was trying to do was illustrate "GM world description + player cleverness = unforeseen resources &amp; options."<br/><br/>Cool?<br/><br/>As for the design question that started this:<br/><br/>Try taking the "move your characters around the town through narration, engaging the mechanics when the fiction dictates" dynamic out of <i>Dogs</i> and see if it still makes roleplayers happy.

Do you propose a trade off where both of us will try out the others theory? <i>Or only me trying out yours?</i> If you offer a trade off, in good faith I'll say in advance the best I can offer is, where one goal seems to contradict another, I could only think in terms of watering down one goal to facilitate another. I honestly don't know how to get around that - what's the trick to it?\n<blockquote>I agree with you, you cannot play against your character values to win Dogs.</blockquote>\nI didn't say that. I think you're using the ambiguity of there actually being no win condition, and of having characters, to merge the ambiguities together to say whatever the characters goal is, is winning. EVEN if the character <i>changes their goal midplay</i>, I'd bet. You plan to kill all sinners, but then mid play, without even thinking of this before play began, you make an exception for some, for example. Moving goal posts for a win condition. I'm pretty sure alot of people who want to win at a game just aren't interested in such an arrangement. It's not going to work as a win condition for them. Never mind some others who wanted the dead sinners pastiche to be reinforced by play and you went and broke it "It doesn't happen like that in the movies!"\n<blockquote>If you want to say that in Dogs moral choice is primary, strategy's secondary, roleplay is tertiary, then fine, whatever, as long as you agree that they're all vital and Dogs wouldn't be what it is without all of them.</blockquote>\nUntil the person in your example treats, for a particular game, some of them coming ahead of others / having priority over the others (Asimov's law style), then this isn't any concession. That example player is simply treating the agenda that comes to their mind first as the first and foremost agenda to pursue. If you want to argue that they need some instructions on how to actually pursue a narrativist agenda because maybe they just don't know how, I'd say yeah, good point, lets work on that. But if they kinda get there's another way to play, that that's <i>what you play the game for</i>, but still try and play it another way - they are just breaking social contract - they aren't being all imaginative and creative, they are just breaking SC.<br/><br/>I'm pretty dang sure Ron Edwards could play the game you made up, with other people, with just that narrativist agenda first and foremost, and it'd work out. Narrations following rule structure. He played my diary of a skull soldier with other people without people breaking the structure of the game, after all. It <i>can</i> happen.\n<blockquote>All I was trying to do was illustrate "GM world description + player cleverness = unforeseen resources &amp; options."</blockquote>\nIt doesn't. The extra resource <i>at stake</i> is the +2. No other resources are available. Does your player in your example know this? Or does he know it, but doesn't give a shit, his narration is so good it can break the SC and still be right?<br/><br/>Is your notion of 'roleplay' narrations that actually upheave the very social contract? If not, why is your example player expecting to be able to break the SC agreement to play this particular game, right now, with these people (as Edwards likes to put it every so often)<br/><br/>If you want to put in an option for the GM to assign a +10, with the text advising to do so only on special occasions (and perhaps only once per game?), that's cool. Or even a +15. Though I BET you can feel it in your bones that the bigger the amount, the more you'd undermine the moral conundrum. The more you enable you're 'roleplay', the more you undermine your 'moral conundrum' - SS isn't making that happen, it's just making that explicit, while LD hides the fact that favouring one undermines the other.\n<blockquote>Try taking the "move your characters around the town through narration, engaging the mechanics when the fiction dictates" dynamic out of Dogs and see if it still makes roleplayers happy. I suspect it wouldn't. What do you think?</blockquote>\nDude, by now you should see the pattern in me that I take peoples questions and figure the underlying assumptions they work from, then address those assumptions that seem faulty. If you can't see that pattern in me, no doubt it'll seem I'm dodging answering your question.<br/><br/>Okay, the fiction dictates when you use the mechanics? So if all session long the fiction dictated to not use the mechanics at all, that's be fine and hunky dory?<br/><br/>No, it wouldn't. C'mon, that is ouja board style gaming - where someone has an agenda to get to these mechanics, but we all pretend no, it's just pure and untainted fiction that's dictating when the mechanics are used (even though actually it'd be a bummer if we never used the mechanics at all during the session).<br/><br/>So to answer your question, actually when you take out 'the fiction dictates when a mechanic is used' <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">to some degree</span></i>, it does make people happy (people who want to see those mechanics used during the session)\n<blockquote>When you do let the fiction dictate things, then, traditionally, there's a high chance you get donkey-boating. It isn't the player inventing resources, it's the GM inventing resources and the player recognizing them and utilizing them. Which is, it seems to me, the point of the "what would work" logic you originally proposed in your note about cart defects and NPC temperaments. But maybe not? </blockquote>\nThe GM is just talking - he hasn't proposed giving the player something that isn't in the rules. Only the player has done that by inventing RL resources for himself.<br/><br/>The entire scope of 'what would work' logic ONLY gets to operate within the assignment of +2.<br/><br/>Think of it as a dial for how much 'what would work' is allowed to occur. The dial is turned all the way <i>down </i>to +2 for this game.<br/><br/>'What would work' logic is in this game - but merely at the dial setting of the +2.<br/><br/>Example player wants to turn the dial up to 11? That's nice. Either decide to stop playing the game <i>as is</i>, or tell him no.<br/><br/>But it seems you're intoxicated with the idea 'the player just utilised the prior spoken fiction!'. I don't know if you genuinely believe that (and so are kind of exiled from narrativist play by your belief) or if you know it's an illusion of interaction but want the illusion really bad? Either way I imagine you'll insist that the player engaged a RL interaction and that how can you go back on something that really happened? And I'll sigh wistfully, as I see a magic show and you see magic. Hopefully I'm guessing wrong on this outcome.<br/><br/>The player hasn't utilised anything - it's just a pleasurable magic show illusion of FAKE cause and effect. He hasn't utilised anything except your sympathies.

I got that eventually, and I think it's a neat idea, and all I really meant to ask* is, "So would that be fun for people who like roleplaying?"  I just wanted to hear what you thought on that score.<br/><br/>My first reaction is that it <i>doesn't</i> sound fun, but I'm trying to keep an open mind, figure out why my first reaction is what it is, and maybe move past it.  I thought maybe hearing your thoughts on how "the fun of roleplay" connects to "use 'what would work' logic only for a +2" would help.  But I still haven't heard them.<br/><br/>I guess I should just try to whittle down my own criteria for "the fun of roleplay".<br/><br/><b>Making roleplay choices that influence neither the mechanics nor later fiction?</b>  Definitely no "roleplay fun" for me.<br/><br/><b>Making roleplay choices that greatly influence important mechanics and where the fiction goes?</b>  Definite "roleplay fun" for me.<br/><br/><b>Making roleplay choices that greatly influence where the fiction goes, but don't impact the mechanics?</b>  Yeah, I've gotten "roleplay fun" out of that.<br/><br/><b>Making roleplay choices that greatly influence important mechanics, but don't impact where the fiction goes?</b>  Hmm.  Do dungeon crawls heavy on fictional positioning count?  I've played a lot of those.  I've gotten "roleplay fun" from a few sources in those cases:<br/><br/>1) Like-minded players who drape fictional color on all sorts of character actions even if they don't have to, and fill in the space between fights with portrayal.<br/><br/>2) GMs who really encourage and support the use of fictional facts as game resources.  GMs who want to reward me for being clever and creative in the "what would work" department, such that donkey boating = great play.<br/><br/>So, the question of whether I get "roleplay fun" from the sort of dungeon crawl I played in college comes down to the frequency and extent of these phenomena.  How <i>much</i> character portrayal does the group appreciate, and how <i>big</i> an impact does the GM allow fictional positioning to have?  If the answer is "not much", then no "roleplay fun" for me.  We really, really ought to be playing a board game instead.  (And, in fact, my D&amp;D groups that leaned in that direction <i>did</i> have more fun playing board games.)<br/><br/><b>Conclusion:</b>  Based on that, my guess is that "deal with the fiction for a +2" only gives me "roleplay fun" if the +2 is a big deal and if I truly do something to earn it, something more than saying "yes" to an obvious opportunity the GM gives me.  And if it comes up often.  So, in our Serial Spine game, are these the case?<br/><br/>Well, +2 on a d6 is a big bonus.  Each roll is only moderately consequential, but over the series of them, a bunch of +2s vs zero +2s makes a big difference.  So I'll say "yes" on that front.<br/><br/>There are a bunch of rolls.  So I'll say, "yes, often".<br/><br/>As for whether I earn the +2 by really contributing, I'll say "no", I don't think that's there yet in the rules we've written out thus far.  "GM bases the +2 on what would work" is an opportunity, but no guarantee.<br/><br/>Can we provide that guarantee, or at least up the odds?  Perhaps we could instruct the GM, "present the player with a fictional problem you haven't already solved"?  I don't think that's quite right, though.  Hmm.<br/><br/>Another option would be to ditch the +2 entirely and, as you suggested, bring the focus back to the moral choices.  I have an idea for that, but I should probably pause first to give you a chance to respond to all this.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*Sorry if my hypothetical examples were distracting.  The donkey-boating was just intended to illustrate a thing a player might do if the game otherwise denies them their roleplay fun (or if "+2 <i>only</i>" wasn't a clear rule; but now it is).  So let's tackle the "roleplay fun" issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411533/#Comment_411533" name="Item_215" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T00:43:26+00:00" title="April  8, 2013 12:43AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2013 12:50AM by Callan_S.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not gunna say I like definately know a solution, but perhaps something like a 'showing your working out' bonus. Like each time you describe a causal chain of X leading to Y, you get, say +5% bonus (maybe 10% - I'm working rough right now). You can even go back and describe smaller causal chains in between X and Y (X leading to X2 which leads to Y2 which leads to Y, as an example of expanding the causal description). I'll risk saying have a time limit, because wow, that sort of thing can potentially go on endlessly! Anyway, once it's done maybe roll the percentile - even if the GM doesn't pay you the +2, if you pass the roll you get +2. And maybe even if the GM pays the +2, you can still roll and if you pass you get +3 instead. And if you fail the roll, maybe you get to keep half of the percentage for the next roll (until you pass), so some amount of your prior work definately still matters in play (ie, if you talked about causal effects for five minutes, its NOT like you roll, fail and it was all for naught. It'll all add up). Perhaps put a maximum amount on the number of causal chains that can be described. But honestly, since were working with percentile, there's a max limit anyway - if you get to 100%, you've automatically passed regardless!<br/><br/>I kinda think that'd work as one method - alot of gamers have a causal theory in their heads about taking actions and would like to say it. In fact I'd add to the rules that if someone argues that a causal chain the player describes does not work - even if the player ends up agreeing it wouldn't work and instead describes something else, they STILL get the bonus percentage.<br/><br/>Is that anywhere near where you were talking about, David? Or am I way off base? Heh, even if I am way off base, I like the idea!

I would love to try that.  Trying now to imagine how it'd play out:<br/><br/>Having completed the previous phase of travel (including making a roll), the player is now ready to play for the next bonus to the next roll.  "So now what's happening?" they ask.  The GM describes that the cart has reached rocky terrain that's banging up the wheels.  Going slowly should keep the wheels intact, while going fast risks destroying them.  The NPC assistants are getting tired and frustrated and might not be giving their all right now.  The GM asks, "So what do you do to improve the trip?"<br/><br/>(By the way, this example sounds very much like Ryuutama!)<br/><br/>The GM sets two clocks, one for 5 minutes, the other for 1 minute.  (New idea.  I'll explain.)  If the roleplay is still going when the 5-minute clock rings, it ends.  The 1-minute clock gets reset every time the player gets a +5% bonus.  So if you're coming up with ideas at a decent pace, you can get the full 5 minutes, but you can't just draw out the 5 minutes by being stumped but refusing to admit it.<br/><br/>The player tosses out some vague ideas and the GM says either "I don't see that working, but you could try to convince me" or "that might work, tell me how you go about it".  Then the player starts narrating:<br/><br/><i>I'm going to motivate the assistants to carry the baggage to take the weight off the cart so the cart can go faster without splintering.</i> (GM gives "thumbs up", so player writes down a check mark, signifying +10%)<br/><br/><i>I go up to the assistants and say, [something gets roleplayed here that I won't type out].  (+10%)<br/><br/>Now that they're cheered up, I say, "Let's take this stuff out of the cart and carry it so the cart is lighter!"  (+10%)<br/><br/>With less weight pushing down on the wheels, I'll try to make the cart go faster, hoping that it won't be damaged.  (+10%)<br/><br/>Hmm, I still have some time on the clock.  Okay, realizing that the assistants will lose their good cheer at some point, I lead them in a rousing song to keep up their spirits!</i><br/><br/>GM objects, saying "You've already motivated them as much as you can, and a song isn't going to stop muscle fatigue from setting in."<br/><br/>Player grumbles but there's nothing they can do, so they try to think of something else.  <br/><br/>The GM judges that the player's idea, though it wouldn't work, was a solid effort, and thus gives them a check mark on the GM's sheet, signifying +5%.  If the player had said something utterly nonsensical in a transparent attempt to get a bonus, the GM would not have made a check mark.  (We need some standards, right?  We don't want players to just spew bullshit fiction that no one enjoys and give themselves bonuses for 5 minutes.)<br/><br/>After a minute of no luck, the player can't think of a better idea than singing, the 1-minute clock rings and the scene is over.  (Or, if the player is a good sport, they admit after 20 seconds that they're stumped, and the scene ends then.)  The player has 4 check marks (40%) and the GM has one (5%), so the player rolls percentile dice hoping for 45 or less.<br/><br/>Would that be fun?  Hmm.  I'll have to think about that.  I know some players whose fun would be ruined by any sort of ticking clock.  Not sure if there's a way around that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411586/#Comment_411586" name="Item_217" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T13:09:50+00:00" title="April  8, 2013  1:09PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to put an alternate idea on the table, from the angle of emphasizing the moral choices:<br/><br/>In character creation, fill in each of the following blanks with an adjective, describing why you won't do that, based on your values.<br/><br/>Abandoning your sick mother would be (1) __________.<br/>Letting your kingdom be breached by invaders would be (2) __________.<br/>Forsaking your god would be (3) __________.<br/><br/>When it's time to make your journey progress rolls, for each roll you get a +2 if your character takes action to speed the journey, as long as that action is (1), (2), or (3).

But maybe you're right about too much "GM is in charge" being an issue.  The GM who gives everything a thumbs-down and declares much of it to be "not even a serious effort" -- this guy could be a <i>much</i> worse problem than the player who spouts bad fiction.  I'm guessing he's less frequent, though.  Hmm.  Not sure what the ideal balance is.<br/><br/>I also worry there's not enough for the GM to do, but we can revisit that later.\n<blockquote>I'd make it an extra two minutes, because it's hard to say anything in one minute - but playtesting could prove me wrong on that!</blockquote>\nI've done some looking at the clock on this stuff, and over a minute is pretty common when a player is asking questions and trying to form a basic direction.  Once they've got their first idea, though, then the ideas tend to follow each other rapidly, with pauses rarely exceeding 5 seconds.  I was trying to pick a time that would work for both "get started" and "peter out", just to keep things simple, but maybe that's not worth it.  Maybe instead:<br/><br/>- 5 minute timer for the whole process<br/>- once the player finishes asking and pondering and declares "here's what my character does", a second timer is brought out<br/>- whenever the player earns a bonus, set the second timer (or reset it) for 1 minute<br/>- when either timer rings, the scene is over<br/><br/>Alternatively, a much shorter second timer (say, 20 seconds) could be set to measure pauses, and stopped when someone resumes narrating, so a narrator on a roll can have as much time as they need; but I think that'd just lead to a lot of grasping and abortive brainstorming out loud, to prevent the clock from starting.<br/><br/>Hopefully 1 minute is enough for a brief pause and then the full narration of the next idea.\n<blockquote>Kinda me, but I'd consider a wooden spoon award of +1% or something for admitting defeat and by doing so helping the pace of the game.</blockquote>\nOh, good call!  That award could be way bigger and I'd still be cool with it.  Perhaps +7%?  So it's still less than if you could churn out another good idea, or two okay-but-not-quite ideas, but it's better than struggling just to come up with one more okay-but-not-quite idea?<br/><br/>P.S. I'm going to be away for the next 5 days, but will come back to this when I return.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411701/#Comment_411701" name="Item_220" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-09T17:34:59+00:00" title="April  9, 2013  5:34PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Eh, GM's thumbs up seems to be relevant here?

Even if it was climbing a cliff using sense motive.<br/><br/>Would you describe that as LD, as that rule doesn't describe the limits of tolerance of the social contract, WM? Someone can protest, but if the die roll passes, it's in - there are no limits after that.<br/><br/>As I've defined LD, it's in regard to procedure.<br/><br/>I think you're refering to the spoken fiction level (rather than procedure) and that someone could go on and speak fiction that is dislocated from any prior fiction.

Yes, not an LD but jeepformed, in the sense that the not fully verbalized rules appear when they are needed, which could be a sort of organized disorder.<br/><br/>How often do we roll the dice? The game states that only when conflict arises, puts a couple of examples and leaves the rest to the social contract. The GM enforces the rule, but so do players when it their turn and in other's players turn. The first few events that trigger dice-rolling may come as a surprise for a newcomer, but gradually the player adapts to the point she can predict when a roll will be needed and reach for her dice. But that last part is a mix of her own will, knowledge of the game, the group usual reaction, the GM's way to enforce the rules... you see, bit by bit we're going into the domain of the social contract.<br/><br/>Which isn't explained in the book. Which keeps being hand-waved by designers. With exceptions that are beggining to become the norm. I'd say we should invade this domain a bit more. Of course, not to the point of pointing exact table manners (though I've readed a few japanese games that elegantly and politely do so and make absolute sense) nor brainwashing GMs and players to play your game without adding their creativity - dunno about you but this surely would take out my kind of fun out of RPGs - but into another idea.<br/><br/>Which I think would be to provide a zero procedure in the rules to help create a healthy social contract, able to bring the players and GM into the kind of atmosphere the designer had in mind when she designed the game... <i>only for the first ten minutes of the first session</i>. After that, the zero procedure is to be discarded, in the same way you remove the safety net in the circus and let the breathtaking spectacle begin. Play unsafe, keep the rules, use whatever you liked or your own experience with other games, etc.<br/><br/>(And please stop thinking for other people, it really gets on their nerves. We realize you are brilliant and how our slow thinking gets on your nerves, but seriously, whenever you go and outhink people, you put words in their mouths that -yes- they <i>may have</i> thought, but <i>didn't say for a good reason.</i> I mean no offense, I'm not offended and seems nobody here is, but that doesn't mean you don't hit a few nerves when you do this)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411964/#Comment_411964" name="Item_224" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-13T17:21:06+00:00" title="April 13, 2013  5:21PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awhile back on RPG net I suggested an idea of writing a session much like a pick a path book.
