I do prep on my PC and print it out for actual play.<br/><br/>I'm sure the feeling of devices at the table being weird will change as time goes by.  One day they'll be inside our heads.  However for now, I still think devices in the players' hands are an impediment to immersion and can often work against the flow.<br/><br/>So in summation: WEB-BASED GM PREP TOOLS.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Isaac" title="Isaac"><img alt="Isaac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Isaac">Isaac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448233/#Comment_448233" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-27T02:33:16+00:00" title="August 27, 2015  2:33AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Alsf said.<br/><br/>For my personal experiences:<br/><br/>* For Burning Wheel character creation, web tools speed up a lot of the process. I familiarized myself with the lifepaths by stating up a bunch of NPCs that way when I was learning the system.<br/><br/>* Pinterest for reference images.<br/><br/>* I've used music/sound loops to set the mood. Seems to work best with long background soundscapes rather than trying to do in-the-moment sound effects. Tabletop Audio is probably the gold standard for this, though I've tragically not gotten to make as much use of it as I'd like to. I've also got the DMDJ app but have yet to use it in anger.<br/><br/>* At the actual table, the two big problems is that when you're looking at a screen you're not looking at the other players, and that they tend to be really distracting. Even when players were using a device just for reference, it was tempting when there was too much downtime. I now basically only buy roleplaying books that I intend to run as physical copies, because it's hard to introduce a new game to people by passing around a tablet. <br/><br/>* PDFs for reference/prep/secondary reference still get used; and smaller games work fine from PDF. But if I can't print out the relative information on a few pages, it's much harder going. Plus I can have multiple copies of reference sheets and things. I've got what amounts to a Dungeon World starter kit in a three-ring-binder, with character sheets, reference pages, and so on.<br/><br/>* Having the players keep a record of the sessions on a campaign blog seems like a good way to keep them engaged beyond the session, though I haven't really had a chance to follow through on that.<br/><br/>* I use Google Docs (or whatever they renamed it to this week) for a lot of planning stuff, especially text-heavy things. I've also used Obsidian Portal's wiki for campaigns.<br/><br/>* I've run a one-on-one Google-docs Dungeon World play-by-post game. Could use an edit notification to let the other player know that they can respond.<br/><br/>* Going further afield, there are several play-by-email systems. I recently wrapped up a campaign using <a href="http://www.vsca.ca/Callisto/" rel="nofollow">Callisto</a>, and wrote <a href="http://callisto.isaackarth.com/2015/08/08/behind-the-scenes-the-data/" rel="nofollow">a data visualiser to show the relationships between the characters</a> as they wrote letters to each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448234/#Comment_448234" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-27T06:49:45+00:00" title="August 27, 2015  6:49AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Prep &amp; scheduling.

I love the flexibility of the Wiki combined with the power of Semantic and templates - it's nice to be able to click on an NPCs name in a session log and see their basic information and a list of other sessions where they turned up, or to answer "who was that guy we talked to who knew about trains" by using the search feature. It's proven useful enough that nobody minds me sitting there taking session notes as we go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448275/#Comment_448275" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-30T06:54:06+00:00" title="August 30, 2015  6:54AM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2015 6:54AM by Wilhelm.">edited August 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I play by post over Google+.<br/><br/>I use the Nokia word processor in my phone to make game prep.<br/><br/>Sometimes I use MOC to play music from a laptop when we play at a table.<br/><br/>I use Emacs+org-mode on the computer to write my games and handouts. <br/><br/>Typeset with LaTeX, but for my latest game I handed the typesetting and layout to a friend who uses Indesign.<br/><br/>To the extent that I do illustrations I use Gimp and ImageMagic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy" title="chaiboy"><img alt="chaiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/368/nWWEJX1TT1UNK.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy">chaiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448278/#Comment_448278" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-30T17:52:35+00:00" title="August 30, 2015  5:52PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use both ipad and kindle over the years so i've used a few apps on both sides.<br/><br/>Onenote or Evernote is used to create notes and write out ideas since i can attach images<br/><br/>Google docs I like because it is accessible on all my computers and syncs better than iCloud.
