One of them is how character creation works in games like Diaspora and SotC: it involves input from folks around the table. This is great and I think it produces really neat investment and ideas. What isn't so great is when new players join the group and/or when you're just not sure who's gonna show up.<br/><br/>SotC's pulp-serial style works just grand with people coming and going. Some of your team's around, some of them aren't, who cares, let's go punch a Nazi. This is a little iffier with Diaspora, but I suppose that comes down to your campaign premise.<br/><br/>Anyway, what I'm really looking for is good ideas to smooth over the process of injecting a new player into a Diaspora game in motion. The only idea I've had so far is to sort of randomly decide who's to the player's virtual left and virtual right and then request/require they fit their third and fourth phases into the phases that were already established. However, that kind of interferes with all that fun authorship.<br/><br/>Other ideas?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251031/#Comment_251031" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-15T11:45:30+00:00" title="January 15, 2010 11:45AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2010 11:48AM by Scott.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Use different questions or situations for the phases to insert them into the setting/genre.

Having them write at least one aspect about another player's character or two is helpful too. But really, at least for Disapora, there's so much going on in the first session that I don't try to replicate it -- a new player needs to get inserted fast while the car is moving.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
