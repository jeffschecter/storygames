How many named characters do you pit against the heroes, and how many minions?  What makes for a good balance that's neither too easy or takes too long?<br/><br/>In our game sessions so far, I've mostly pitted the PCs against minions, and I find that using standard numbers of minions (based on the Minions Stunt) isn't enough of a challenge.  In the first action scene (the fight with the Klan mentioned <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4919&amp;page=1#Item_23" rel="nofollow">here</a>) I set the 4 heroes up against a named bad guy ("John Riley, KKK boss") with Good in Fists and Guns, Fair in Resolve.  Riley initially had 12 Fair minions with him.  The minions started going down three at a time, and were soon gone.  The PCs split up at one point, and I Compelled one of them regarding his "The KKK Knows Me" aspect, and as a result brought in 3 reinforcement minions.  They went down immediately.  Riley took a bit longer, ultimately taking only one level two stress and two consequences before he surrendered (conceded). <br/><br/>In a later fight, I rolled out 20 Fair minions and a Good Lieutenant with the "Aura of Fear" stunt.  The fight took longer- partly because a player spent a Fate point to be able to stumble across more bad guys- but it wasn't a big challenge.  The lieutenant ended up losing most of his Composure and getting Taken Out.<br/><br/>They have dealt with one or two more powerful named villains- one PC had a "duel of kisses" with a Femme Fatale who ended up giving him a few consequences and then poisoning him for the win, but I felt like I was using the "Big Blue GM Hand" to push that one a bit.<br/><br/>So how does everyone else do it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BastardToadflax" title="BastardToadflax"><img alt="BastardToadflax" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BastardToadflax">BastardToadflax</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115334/#Comment_115334" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T10:14:31+00:00" title="December 19, 2007 10:14AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>It's really hard to appropriately size up the villains.

Things you can do to beef up the bad guys include: (a) giving minions certain skills above their otherwise generalized rating; (b) giving minions fate points; (c) give named villains more than the standard number of stunts.  Otherwise, it's strategy.  Make sure your villains are making best use of the aspects system, just as the pcs are, and be sure that you attach minions to your villain to give him a buffer against the PCs.</p>\n<p>There are some notes on this in the evil hat wiki, btw.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115344/#Comment_115344" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T10:56:12+00:00" title="December 19, 2007 10:56AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've settled into a pattern of about 3-4 stress points of minions per player character, usually of Fair (+2) minions.  A recent battle with 3 named NPCs and 8 Fair minions against four PCs took an hour, which went pretty fast, and would probably have been shorter except that the third NPC was present only as a result of a self-compel by one of the players.  A different fight in another game that pitted five PCs against one leader and 8 Fair minions took 45 minutes.  Four of the players were new to SOTC so I think the battle would go faster with more experience.  <br/>I think a useful guide is that each successful maneuver, which adds +2 to any future attacks against a target, in effect takes out a Fair minion once that attack is made (maybe a little less considering the group bonus).  So, in very rough terms, the heroes will need a number of exchanges equal to the number of (Fair) minions before getting to the fight with the named NPCs themselves.  It's taken the players in the games I've ran a couple of fights before realizing the benefit of maneuvers over immediately making attacks--it's something I've learned from watching them apply it against my NPCs!    <br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115364/#Comment_115364" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T11:30:33+00:00" title="December 19, 2007 11:30AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I'm going this route, I use scads of minions. Scads of them. Every fraction of three people in a minion group adds +1 to their rating. So if I know I have a guy with Superb Athletics, and I have Average mooks, I have a group of 10 Average mooks go up against that one character, which lets them attack at Superb (+5). If I have four characters that I want the same challenge for, I have 40 mooks in that scene. If I don't want 40 mooks in that scene, then they're all rated at Good, and that lets me use 6 per PC. If I can justify 10 Good (+3) mooks in a group, I've got a force that attacks at Epic (+7) until their numbers dwindle.<br/><br/>I know what you're thinking: Good God Almighty, that's a lot of mooks just to endanger a PC. And it is. And I don't go this route very often.<br/><br/>But here's the thing - minions aren't intended to endanger the PCs, really. They're really supposed to do two things: allow the PCs to showcase their competence with style and get the players to use FPs. In combat combined with a named villain, they're supposed to absorb hits so the main villain can keep blasting away with impunity. They are the people that the PCs are supposed to steamroller over to get to the real bad guy. They harass, delay, and annoy - they don't win. So if you want them to have a chance, you have to pull out a metric shit-ton of them.<br/><br/>Now, with named characters, the major advantage is that usually, the villains always get to choose the arena of conflict. You always go fight the bad guy in his super-secret underwater base; you don't sucker punch him on the way to the supermarket.<br/><br/>This means that the villain can potentially have a ton of scene aspects preset to make his situation ideal. He's got 10 Fate Points too, and you need to maximize their use. By the time they get to him, the PCs should have had some FPs drained away by encounters with minions and lieutenants. So not only has he got more minions, whom he can attach to for benefits, he's also got a [High Vantage Point], a [Protective Force Field], [Mechanical Death Traps] he can control, and some awesome gadget that lets him use his Superb Engineering to blast death rays down onto the PCs.<br/><br/>Let's say he also has a group of 10 minions on the ramps leading to his platform in this base. Let's say they're Good minions. He gets the +4 numbers bonus, so he attacks and defends at +9. You also have to chew through 30 stress to even start to damage him. And with 10 Fate Points, he has five rounds where he can invoke those two aspects along with his attack, so oh wait, he's attacking at +13. And this isn't counting whatever other stunts he has that might be applicable, or any other improvements on that gadget.<br/><br/>Will he lose? More than likely, because the PCs can do maneuvers and whatnot to negate his advantages and gradually wear him down. Will he put the fear of God into any single PC before he loses? Absolutely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115363/#Comment_115363" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T11:30:44+00:00" title="December 19, 2007 11:30AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the ideas, guys.

They definitely need either minions or to match the PCs in numbers. Otherwise, their skills should top them to a large degree, at least offensively, if you want to give them consequences. I find that a even or low defense works good. The combat doesn't last too long, and the players make progress in a straight forward fight.  Having it high can drag out the combat, and promote a lot of manuevers, burning Fate and non-standard tactics. Generally good for a climax, or when you want to see a Take Down on the PCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115367/#Comment_115367" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T11:35:13+00:00" title="December 19, 2007 11:35AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I made rules for an intermediary category of bad guy to do privileged henchmen with: <a href="http://evilhat.wikidot.com/threats" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://evilhat.wikidot.com/threats</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115374/#Comment_115374" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-19T11:42:27+00:00" title="December 19, 2007 11:42AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's really interesting, Lenny- <i>Threats</i> as you describe them are exactly what I've been doing for my "named" NPCs.
