There were a lot of us and we had to skip through a bit due to time constraints, but it was freaking great!  The players and their characters:<br/><br/><b>Ping:</b>  Sen. Josephine "Jo" Stewart, Maine, issue:  Health Care<br/><b>Chris:</b>  Gov. Bart "Nootie" Atkins, Louisiana, issue:  Immigration (family owns a chain of "Nootie Bars")\n<blockquote>Thinks he's a nice guy, has no idea he's insanely bigoted.</blockquote>\n<b>John:</b>  Gov. Christina "Christi" Buck, Arizona, issue:  Welfare\n<blockquote>Former welfare mom who pulled herself up by her bootstraps.</blockquote>\n<b>Jackson:</b>  Gov. Jeffery Tourneau, Montana, issue:  Gun "Control"<br/><b>Matthew:</b>  Gov. Harold Shvarzenberger, Gubernator of Calyfornia, issue:  Environment\n<blockquote>A former actor and fitness buff with a distinct accent and exuberant personality.  All resemblances to any etc. etc.</blockquote>\n<b>Brendan (Me):</b>  Sen. Stuart Gorch, Ohio, issue:  Civil Rights\n<blockquote>Paraplegic Vietnam vet who enjoys using other people's reactions to him for cruelty and manipulation.</blockquote>\n<b>Event 1:  Throwing Hats into the Ring</b><br/><br/>We realize these are pretty much individual by definition and skip them.<br/><br/><b>Event 2:  Iowa Caucus</b>\n<ol><li>The Jonathan Burt Late Nite Show, filmed live from a cornfield in Iowa (or rather a former cornfield which was mown down and replaced with a field of styrofoam corn).  His first guest is Jo Stewart, there to discuss her universal health care plan; his surprise second guest is Stuart Gorch, who emerges on a motorized La-Z-Boy to point out that some Americans have an easier ride than others.  Jo makes a show of getting up from the couch to make room for him before giggling and sitting down again.  Stuart makes some jokes at Jo's expense that make the audience titter nervously, and she points out how PROUD she is of him and all Americans who are "disabled or unable."<br/><br/>I pull out my card (Bootlick) and introduce the surprise THIRD guest, former President Arthur Thomas Jennings (played by John).  Jonathan (played by Jackson, incidentally) asks both the candidates if they have any questions for the president; Jo manages something about how much ice cream he ate at state dinners, and then Stuart pounces and asks whom he was endorsing.  At this point Ping plays Draft Dodger and reveals that Stuart lost the use of his legs during the war...  in Canada.  We dice, with Jonathan coming around to Jo's side against Stuart and Arthur; Arthur wins the roll and declares that the American people don't want "gossip-mongering harridans" in the White House.<br/><br/></li><li>At a restaurant in Iowa, Bart "Nootie" Atkins corners wealthy Kayla Brandon, manager of the American Milk Solids PAC.  He explains reasonably to her that the greatest immigration threat posed to the American people is from "Chegroes," and that the Great Wall of China should be extended to cover "all of China, down into Africa, and also South Central LA."<br/><br/>At this point Harold Shvarzenberger barges in, trailing a media entourage and bear-hugging a disgruntled Jeffery Tourneau.  He orders a drink for Jeffery and two of the same thing for everyone else in the bar.  Then both candidates notice Nootie and Kayla; Kayla states that the greatest threat to American families is, in fact, CANADIAN milk solids, and wants to know what each of the three of them can do to keep them out of our living rooms.  Nootie proposes extending the wall to Canada too.  Jeffery says that he already has a wall on the border of Montana, and it's made of guns, pointing north.  Harold, from his perch on the bar (and, in real life, Matthew's stance on the table) promises to produce better milk solids by squeezing Californian cows "much harder."  We dice; Jeffery wins Kayla's endorsement, and the next morning the newspapers carry pictures of her trying to escape Nootie's grasp, with headlines about the scandal of "Chegrogate."<br/><br/></li><li>In Christina "Christi" Buck's hotel room, she's watching a movie about the Kennedys and gorging herself on room service (John got roached in round 1) and attempting to create rumors that she's having an affair with idealistic young Senator Martin Blaylock (played by Matthew).  He stammers a lot and attempts to scoot away from her on the couch as she purrs and inquires which Senators, exactly, she should call to help his farm bill get through if he'll "give her a hand."  Jeffery calls Martin's cell phone (which he quickly puts on speaker) and drunkenly wonders where he is and why he's not at the party and where is he exactly and how does he get there?  Christi wants the rumors to get out, so she whispers to Jeffery that they're in a "pants-optional room" and hangs up.  She attempts to make Martin's pants very optional, since she knows he must have to use the bathroom soon, causing Matthew to declare that he has "notoriously strong bladder control."<br/><br/>On the TV in the background, Jonathan Burt (played by me) appears for his live TV ad and declares that Martin and Christi have created "the most boring shack-up rumors ever--do you think he stammers when she gets hot flashes?"  The roll came down to Martin's and Christi's d8s versus Jonathan's puny d4, and the Senators win.  Christi musses Martin's clothes and smears some lipstick on his face before kicking him out, declaring that they can "discuss your bill over breakfast at Denny's, Toots."</li></ol> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158934/#Comment_158934" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-27T18:14:27+00:00" title="July 27, 2008  6:14PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Event 3:  Nationally Televised Debate</b>\n<ol><li>Harold shoves Nootie, Christi and Jo into a town car with Regina Forrest, Perky Cub Reporter (Jackson) who has come astonishingly far despite her pronounced lisp, in hopes that one or all of them will get catty and provide the reporter with a scandal.<br/><br/>John:  "You know, on one level this is a reporter with three candidates, and on another level it's just Nootie with three chicks."<br/>Chris:  "If this was a Nootie limo, I'd be even more for it!"<br/><br/>After some sniping between Christi and Jo, Nootie orders the driver to pull over so that he can look at the sunrise.  "Master, you have come!" he declares shrilly, standing on the side of the highway, and drops his pants to ululate praises to his newly discovered roach.  Christi plays a roach card to "confront this one in the proper manner," and hisses loudly before spraying acid from her mouth in Jo's eyes.  Matthew, whose character wasn't even there, wins the roll--so Regina reports everything, and none of the three candidates comes off looking good.</li></ol>\n(At this point, it was after 11 and we skipped to the final event.)<br/><br/><b>Event 4:  National Convention</b>\n<ol><li>John drew another roach card and wanted to eject it, so he narrated a short scene in which Christi and Martin were coupling violently in the back of a limo when she vomited her roach directly into his mouth.  He woke up roached in a drunk tank, and she lost her enthusiasm for debauchery, "never again to know the touch of a man."  No opposition.<br/><br/></li><li>Nootie's keynote speech, in which he declares that Jeffery Tourneau is "not like the others"  and displays poorly photoshopped pictures to indicate that he consorts with Chegroes.  He then begins ululating, waggling his tongue and pinching his nipples on live TV.  Cheers all around.  No opposition.<br/><br/></li><li>Combo scene!  We start with Jeffery's speech declaring that while a vote for him is a vote for success, there are some votes more important.  He roaches up and plays his "praise this person" card on Stuart, "a candidate not wholly man, not wholly machine," as Stuart and his chair descend from the ceiling on wires, pinwheel fireworks on each wheel and sparklers out his ears.<br/><br/>Stuart says that he's proud to accept Jeffery's endorsement, and I in turn play Slander on Harold to reduce his status dice to d4, declaring that he was "not an American citizen, tied to paramilitary neo-Nazi groups" (the delegates simply nod, unsurprised) and that while Stuart might be half machine, at least he's not "half man, half woman!"  Gasps all around.<br/><br/>Matthew counters with I don't remember what card, but it takes his dice back up to d10s, and Harold headlocks Jeffery to declare that his muscles are "100% natural."<br/><br/>Cut!  We jump backstage here to a simultaneous scene in which Christi confronts Jo about the impending danger of the roach to the american people, since Christi can tell that the roach hates Jo and she's not yet infected.  At this point, roach-wild Nootie stumbles backstage shrieking and waving a shotgun he's commandeered from one of Jefferey's gun nut guards.  Jo (who, remember, is not roached) wins the resulting roll; she calmly takes advantage of Nootie's distraction to get revenge for the acid-spitting by pulling a syringe from her pocket and poisoning Christi.<br/><br/>Cut back to on stage:  Jeffery takes the headlock opportunity to point a pistol at Harold's bicep and explain that the Gubernator's hazardous workout regimens cost Jeffery's son his arms twenty years ago.  We roll, Jeffery wins, and the bullet rips through both Harold's biceps and incidentally his chest.  (The security snipers on the balcony, hearing shots fired, immediately train their laser sights on Harold and shoot him several times in the head.)  Matthew declared that the strategically placed bullet holes revealed Stuart's intimations about Harold's intersexuality to be all too true.<br/><br/></li><li>We came to the final speeches--a conflict between me and Ping to see which one of our characters would get kicked out of the party entirely.  Christi, poison coursing through her veins, stumbles onstage for her speech and tries to inform the nation that the federal government is their enemy.  "Split into autonomous groups of no more than seven people," she manages.  "National Guard armories must be redistributed locally.  County administrators can manage this until the power transfer is completed.  To vote is to become food, so" THUD.<br/><br/>Jo enters immediately to declare that this poor woman is exhausted and probably dying--if only she had universal health care!  (We later noticed that she was promoting her agenda literally over her opponent's dead body.)  Stuart takes the stage for the final speech, declaring that Jo and her health care obsession are relics of the past.  Stuart stakes his position that the new crucial issue is equal rights for all--the man and the machine; the regular and the intersexed (gesture to poor dead Harold); and both the pure-strain human AND (hug Jeffery, now his running mate) the "roachfully enabled."  We roll, with all three of Ping's Reputation staked against my one (with six in reserve).  Ping wins!</li></ol>\n<b>Conclusion</b><br/><br/>However!  The original setup of the game was that the living, unroached player with the most Rep would win the party nomination, and the roached player with the most rep would get the VP nod.  Ping doubles her stake of three on that last roll and I lose my ante of one, which leaves us tied at six each.  Since Stuart and Jeffery have just been kicked out of the party, we decide that they leave and mount a successful independent candidacy together, while Jo gets the real party nod and is stuck with gleefully insane Nootie as her running mate (to compete for the roached vote, naturally).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158935/#Comment_158935" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-27T18:14:53+00:00" title="July 27, 2008  6:14PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sure I forgot things and missed some of the details, especially in scenes where I wasn't involved and was trying to take notes for this.

Nice counter! A bit of a stretch to call Harold a genius at anything but hey, we're playing the Roach, right? Still, his rolls were not enough to save him from the hail of gunfire that revealed him for the apparent hermaphrodite that he was.

Your greeting of the dawn thing kinda made me wish I'd tied Martin to something, like maybe to a busboy or two.<br/><br/>More generally: the Roach has been a longtime entry on my I-want-to-play-this list, so thanks to Chris for making it so.  And holy crap, people in this game brought the funny.  The milk solids, the Chigroes, the Greeting Of The Dawn, Herr Schvartzenaccent, the stammering/hot flash line, the repeated ruination of xmas, the poison syringe -- gold, all of it.  Thanks guys!<br/><br/>I went in with the idea that the Roach would be compelling us to do unspeakably evil things rather than making us behave badly.    But in this game, the Roach seemed like an embarrassing relative rather than a force for evil. Discovering this, and then getting poisoned by my ambitious but unroached rival while I was desperately trying to warn the nation about the alien menace, was very satisfying. <br/><br/>(Originally, my speech idea for Christi was to get Nutie out on stage with her and re-enact that scene in V where the Visitors are  revealed to be lizards.  She would jam some spicy tofu crawdads into him and force the Roach to flee his body, on camera.  But I liked the syringe so much that I wanted to go out on that bit.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
