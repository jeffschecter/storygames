Watching the trailer for the <i>Zero Theorem </i> and a Moebius comic-binge got me thinking about how this can be explored through play.<br/><br/>I'm struggling to think of examples, but maybe <i>Eclipse Phase</i> or <i>Into the Odd</i> would fit? Can anyone add to the list? <br/><br/>What systems or practices make for a good sensation of the surreal in a sci-fi setting? Whether that's entering "weird space" like in old Star Trek episodes or PCs exploring more metaphysical locations as surreal entities themselves, or some other method. <br/><br/>Is random generation of events and generally obscuring the nature of the game-world from the players an essential part of preserving the mystery of the surreal or can we be more open and definite and say things like "So this is how the Howling plains of Nggul-Tur work" with the expectation that players don't meta-game away the challenge the plains present? Does anyone have any experience of playing in either way?  <br/><br/>In terms of system or mechanical considerations. Is surrealness something that is added as "fluff" around a more grounded/trad play procedure, or does anyone have experience of rules that invoke or encourage the weird? <br/><br/>Not terribly certain how I want this discussion to progress, but hopefully we can go over the terminology, get some examples and chat about surrealness in gaming generally. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.williamstout.com/news/journal/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Moebius35.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429462/#Comment_429462" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-14T08:12:39+00:00" title="March 14, 2014  8:12AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lacuna!!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429463/#Comment_429463" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-14T09:33:51+00:00" title="March 14, 2014  9:33AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Lacuna</i>!

One caveat: It doesn't always go in the direction of the surreal, ... but it can.<br/><br/>I vividly remember when we broke through to the other side of the Psychic Maelstrom in our game and found ourselves in a virginal and unpopulated forest-world. Pretty profoundly surreal imagery given the desperate grimy shittiness of our besieged settlement. It became clear soon afterwards that the apocalypse had been caused by past incarnations of ourselves fracturing the universe into an infinite number of different possibility-spaces. The rest of the game very naturally saw us revisiting the past and travelling to the edge of possibility-space.<br/><br/><br/>---  ---  ---<br/><br/><a href="www.tao-games.com/skew/" rel="nofollow"><i>Skew</i></a> by Ben Lehman is another great example. It's a GM-less game (at least initially) played in multiple rounds and designed to create a short story with strong elements of the surreal in it. In the first few rounds, you collectively define who the main character is and then introduce surreal elements to their everyday life. In later rounds, specific players take ownership of the surreal. The game ends with the main character either mastering the weirdness or being subsumed by it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429488/#Comment_429488" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-15T15:04:28+00:00" title="March 15, 2014  3:04PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2014 9:47PM by Paul_T.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I bet something like <i><a href="http://glyphpress.com/shock/" rel="nofollow">Shock:</a></i> would work, as well, but I've never tried it myself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429490/#Comment_429490" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-15T20:34:45+00:00" title="March 15, 2014  8:34PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/><i>Don't Rest Your Head</i>? I mean it kind of depends what the 'sci-fi' part of 'surreal sci-fi' means. The madness talents of DRYH are generally quite surreal, and if you ignore the book setting and instead construct the world around the PCs and their abilities, you usually end up with a coherently surreal experience. That said, the system is geared towards horror/action rather than the more contemplative strangeness that I associate with (for example) Moebius' art.<br/><br/>I do think there are specific challenges for surreality in roleplaying, because the fiction is already largely or wholly invented; part of the impact of surrealism is the sudden, unexpected juxtaposition of ideas and objects in a way that transforms their context, and points to a concealed meaning beyond the immediate, obvious one. The problem is that in order for there to be a meaning beyond the immediate, obvious one, there first has to <i>be</i> an immediate, obvious meaning that has general consensus. You can't have surreality without reality, and RPGs are already working overtime to construct that first baseline level of reality and invest it with enough meaning and coherence to resonate with players. I think almost anyone who has tried to pursue this kind of roleplaying has experienced what happens when you put too much focus on the sur- and not enough on the -real -- players just start stacking more and more ridiculous things on top of each other, without any tether to a baseline that would give them context. (This is often referred to as 'gonzo' gaming, and it happens in lots of other genres of gaming too.)<br/><br/>This is why surreal sci-fi seems doubly-challenging to me, because the usual solution to this problem is to use a contemporary, familiar setting as a baseline -- Don't Rest Your Head, along with most urban fantasy, works best when you start as close to home as possible. But surrealism in the context of a futuristic society, or an alien planet, becomes more complicated -- unless, again, the PCs are arriving there from somewhere closer to real, so that the sci-fi elements ARE the surreal elements in question.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429491/#Comment_429491" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-15T22:19:17+00:00" title="March 15, 2014 10:19PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ICE spoke sooth.

The setting is as weird and syfy as they come.<br/><br/>In a cyberpunk-ish future humanity did something bad and all reality went batshit crazy. Now civilization survives in cities called "bastions" where a white radiation prevents mind and matter from warping, while everywhere else reality has become fluid and malignant and is called "Deliria". You can find more details on the official website.<br/><br/>Rule-wise it is a GM-Less game where procedures allow Players to explore and discover this bizarre setting and their own characters. The weird feeling is as much color as it is mechanics, because it is a color summoned through specific "crunchy bits" ... small chunks of rules meant to make this crazy world work as it is supposed to be.<br/><br/>For example... Deliria works a bit like the dreams in the <b>Inception</b> movie; there is no fixed geography and you have to travel them by "intentions", and the more you stay in Deliria the more your mere presence causes "friction", calling all kinds of disturbing problems and attention to come your way, and if you want to cut the crap and skip the "wandering" part of a journey through Deliria you have to wish it bad enough... you will reach your destination faster, but you'll also have to face one of your worst fears, alone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429493/#Comment_429493" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-16T05:03:40+00:00" title="March 16, 2014  5:03AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2014 5:50AM by catty_big.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's also <a href="http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/104216/When-Worlds-Collide--Role-Playing-Game" rel="nofollow"> When Worlds Collide</a>, an independently produced Brit RPG about alternative realities and multi-dimensions where you go on a mission and within a short time your understanding of reality is blown apart.

I've certainly got a lot of reading to do. Responding to all of you individually seems like a tall order, so I'll just pick up on the stuff that seems most aligned with my intentions for this discussion. <br/><br/>When I wrote the OP I struggled for a while between asking about "Surreal Sci-fi" or "Weird Sci-fi." Both have crossovers, genre-wise, but have distinctly separate implications in terms of interacting with a setting. I think the "Sci-fi" element is important here but fairly simple to grasp (at least as I understand it) including but not limited to elements such as futuristic settings, futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, parallel universes, extraterrestrial life, etc. You know, sci-fi trope stuff, right? <br/><br/>The surreal element is a little harder to grasp. I'd taken it to mean that the sci-fi elements in the setting would be unexpected or dreamlike (unlike a common-sensical projection of modern trends into a predicted future time that is the usual appreciation of science fiction) but pretty internally consistent. So, yes, the Archduke of Planet Muboo is a huge housecat but he's always been a huge housecat and won't suddenly morph into a sentient block of tofu during play. <i>Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy</i> would probably be a good example of the kind of tone I'm imagining here. Is that even "surreal" as you understand it, or just whimsical soft sci-fi? In this regard games that involve shifting/mutable setting details like Dreamwake might not be what I'm looking for. <br/><br/>I'd like to hear more, AMBayard. What system did you use? <br/><br/>Good advice, Aslf. Although I suspect that multiple systems would soon get merged. What GM could balance 5 different resolution styles? Although it'd be fun to see what kind of organic play/rulings/shorthand emerge from every character having his own rules.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429515/#Comment_429515" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T09:40:54+00:00" title="March 17, 2014  9:40AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can totally imagine HHGttG using the <i>Itras By</i> rules.

I think another card had us play the scene in "reverse time." Totally surreal.<br/><br/>My character was literally a house, but he had been transformed into a person somehow, and he didn't really remember any of that. He just thought his house was missing, and he set off to find it. (Turns out, it was inside him, all along. Aww)<br/><br/><i>Itras By</i> comes with a default (non-SF) setting, but it didn't feel core to the surreal experience, though it certainly helped a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429517/#Comment_429517" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T10:24:29+00:00" title="March 17, 2014 10:24AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2014 10:25AM by Potemkin.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not certain I enjoy the idea of PCs (as avatars of the players) being surreal entities themselves (although houseman sounds like a rewarding little arc) - how is a location or activity meant to feel surreal if "your" reality/perception is already surreal from the offset.

Bilbo in LotR. Luke in Star Wars. Flash in Flash Gordon. Mr.Generic-Suicidal-Guy in Lovecraft. Film takes this convention and runs with it, but RPGs are weird because the audience are also the creators (to lesser or greater extents - even in the most trad gaming you still decide who your character is) so don't have to explicitly pander to an audience's confusion as the literal everymen.<br/><br/>A lot is just handwaved:<br/><br/>A:  "But why are you an elephant headed man? Surely the character would have some philosophic feeling about his elephant-head nature?"<br/>B: "Oh, because it's a surreal world... and I thought it would be cool? You know, the trunk and the tusks. Like Barbar! Badass Barbar! Awesome right?"<br/><br/><br/>"A" is me here. I'm being a sanctimonious tool, true, but you get my point, yeah? I've also been "B"  too! - it's totally cool to get pumped on an idea but not really be interested in exploring all the implications. Sometimes that can just be boring.<br/><br/> A film would probably discuss the "why" of a surreal character before getting onto the plot (nemesis, threat, explosion, yawn) most likely wrapped up in an origin story. A book would probably spend a lot of time on it if it was a central character, like Kafka's <i>Metamorphosis</i>, where we spend all our time as a reader discussing the whys and wherefores of being a giant insect. A game? Well, roleplaying games aren't really equipped to allow for lots of personal introspection on the parts of characters, mostly because it's not something easy to share enjoyably as a social gaming experience I think, and also because we've been trained to start in <i>media res</i> and not dwell on introductory exposition. <br/><br/>Anyway, hugely off topic. <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/> Here's to the confused, bumbling everyman that gives me my view into (and expression in) the fiction we share!

Instead that character, and all the others, were created simply as foils for the GM's multitudinous 'funny' NPCs; we might as well have been aliens from Outer Space as far as our characters were concerned. This is a beef I have with the way a lot of trad games are handled, that the PCs are often merely mechanical means to the GM's end, rather than interesting in their own right. Another example: while playing Victoriana recently I was leafing through the rule book during a break, and I found a graphic of a lion beastman (Victoriana is big on beastmen) in a zoo, observing a lion in a cage. I pointed this out to the GM, and asked what he thought was going through the beastman's mind at that point, to which the GM replied 'I dunno' (subtext: 'Who cares?').                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429533/#Comment_429533" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T15:12:46+00:00" title="March 17, 2014  3:12PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2014 3:20PM by AsIf.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Revisiting my A/B/M notion, but leaving out the total randomness...  For any given NPC (and maybe locations as well), I see three levels into which the surrealism can be injected: Appearance, Behaviour and Meaning.  Appearance refers to observable physical details, Behaviour refers to mechanical functions (skills, dice rolls, etc), and Meaning refers to narrative purpose.  I place them in this order because when I lay them out, I feel like the depth of the interpretation increases as we go from A to B to M.  For instance, let's examine blending "policeman" and "dog":<br/><br/><b>Appearance is symbolic</b> - It behaves as a policeman (it has policeman skills and says things policemen say) and it means the same thing narratively as a policeman (the eyes of the state are upon you) but it looks like a dog.  Straight-up anthropomorphism is trad fare for fantasy fiction, cartoons and childrens' literature - they are full of such analogs.  It is simply accepting of the fact that "this dog is a policeman".  Notwithstanding the fact that he looks like a dog, you may (and should) respond to him as you would a policeman.<br/><br/><b>Behaviour is symbolic</b> - It looks like a policeman (wears a uniform, carries a weapon) and it means the same thing narratively as a policeman (the eyes of the state are upon you) but it behaves like a dog (barks, growls, and sniffs your butt).  This is a deeper statement because it seems to be literally likening policemen to dogs.  Satirical fiction and surrealistic social commentary are full of such tropes (Pink Floyd's "Animals" or Orwell's "Animal Farm"), which push a casual metaphor into an ontological reality of the fictional world.<br/><br/><b>Meaning is symbolic</b> - It looks like a policeman (wears a uniform, carries a weapon) and behaves as a policeman (it has policeman skills and says things policemen say) but it means the same thing narratively as a dog (it's kept as a pet, it begs for treats, it guards your house, etc).  This seems to be the most surreal of all three possibilities, because we cannot trust our first impressions (which tend to be based on appearance or behaviour) to give us a reasonable impression of what the actual Meaning is.<br/><br/>If you displace 2 of these 3 traits, the thing gets much harder to interpret.  If you displace only a partial trait (e.g., the policeman's hands are dog paws), the interpretation gets more subtle or refined (and also somehow creepier).<br/><br/>All of the above is assuming that the "surreal" elements do in fact <i>have</i> some symbolic meaning, rather than being just a totally random stack of mixed-up details.  But you didn't actually stipulate that, so I'll stop here for now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429536/#Comment_429536" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T16:07:12+00:00" title="March 17, 2014  4:07PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, Alst! Although I can't see this being useful in random tables - you have to be meaningful/creative in drawing symbolic connections. I don't think you'd get effective metaphors by juxtaposing two random things and trying to explain how they're symbolically resonant (this section of the Dadaism lecture would always put me to sleep. Telephones, lobsters, blah blah). This is, I suppose, an appeal to GMcraft rather than a legislation by the system that can "produce" the surreal on command. The A/B/M structure you got here is a pretty good way of directing thinking on the nature of allegory, but I have two queries: is the surreal always allegorical (or, is the allegorical always surreal - to what extent must meaning be found in surreality?), and is "Meaning is Symbolic" the right term here. What you're describing seems to be the meaning found in Reversal, e.g. the policeman appears and behaves like a policeman but is in the position of <i>Dog</i> in the surreal world. I suppose a good example from film might be the Baby in <i>Spirited Away</i> - a huge, physically intimidating man prone to violence that is treated as a helpless infant in the surreal world of the spirit's bathhouse. Besides, "Meaning is symbolic" is a tautological statement, right? Maybe... "<i>Role</i> is symbolic?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429537/#Comment_429537" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T16:25:44+00:00" title="March 17, 2014  4:25PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>A lot of genre-agnostic games would work well for what you're describing as well, like <i>Solar System</i> or <i>Land of Nodd</i>.</blockquote>\nTrue, true.

I could never see myself being able to use this at table! It'd be less stress just to eyeball it from wholecloth rather than try interpret this oracle. Maybe I'm also suspicious of AW tables - they look neat but that can often be misleading! <br/><br/>You've got me thinking, that's a fact! I think I like the route of generating the surreality of a setting before play to solidify it as a quasi-comprehensible fictional place over rolling for or inventing major setting details as the narrative progresses  (Wonderland, Oz and Ooo for all their insanity have some fairly consistent rules). So a system of players writing setting elements in secret, or playing <i>exquisite corpse</i> with it, seems like a happier approach for me. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429540/#Comment_429540" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T16:57:48+00:00" title="March 17, 2014  4:57PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The AW mechanics are just an allegory :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429541/#Comment_429541" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-17T17:08:30+00:00" title="March 17, 2014  5:08PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The AW mechanics are just an allegory :-)</blockquote>\nEverything's an allegory with you! &gt;:C<br/><br/><br/>\u201cWe're all mad here.\u201d                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429548/#Comment_429548" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-18T02:23:23+00:00" title="March 18, 2014  2:23AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2014 2:30AM by AsIf.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well... yes, of course it is.<br/><br/>Anyway...  You started this off by asking:\n<blockquote><i>Is random generation of events and generally obscuring the nature of the game-world from the players an essential part of preserving the mystery of the surreal or can we be more open and definite ...</i> </blockquote>\nI think a fundamental question to ask is whether we want the experience to be:<br/>(a) surreal for both the characters and the players (typically done by juxtaposing or contrasting two realities, as in "Don't Rest Your Head" or "When Worlds Collide")<br/>(b) surreal for the players but normal for the characters (this is just any fantasy world you're not yet familiar with, isn't it?  I mean, characters in the "One Piece" world aren't surprised that snails function as ship-to-shore radios).<br/>(c) surreal for the characters but not for the players (this is like playing "Call of Cthulhu" when you know the whole mythos but you still pretend your character has no idea what's going on, right?)<br/><br/>Then it's another question to ask how much of this work should be done ahead of time, and how much on the fly.  Different sorts of systems are needed to solve for those.  Do we want a sandbox, a master map, an emergent multiverse, or some clever combination of those things?<br/><br/>Then we can ask whether we want the players to be collaboratively involved in world creation, and to what degree.  Some might even say that players have a right to determine just how far into the weird you're gonna go.  On this level, I like where you're going with the idea of collaboration, round-robin, or group-determined elements.  "<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/19271/watch-the-world-die-live-forum-playtest#Item_6" rel="nofollow">Watch the World Die</a>" was my solution to a similar dilemma.  I wanted to be able to pregenerate an apocalypse for use in a certain post-apocalyptic game, but I didn't want to disenfranchise the players from their creative right to contribute to world definition in that game.  My solution was to turn the entire exercise into a collaborative narrative game in its own right, and play it as a "preface" to the other campaign.<br/><br/>You could probably do something similar with surreality, although if you chose (a) or (b) above you'll probably want to jumble, blend, or otherwise obscure the players' contributed elements, or they won't be very surprising when the players see them in play.  So if the players are co-creators in the pre-game, perhaps it's best to let them define things only in broad generalities... i.e. the <i>type/genre/degree/flavor</i> of the universe they'll be entering (which seems fair enough I suppose), but not specific locations, NPCs, objects or events.<br/><br/>I think it's a good idea to answer those questions before getting too far along in designing mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429549/#Comment_429549" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-18T03:11:50+00:00" title="March 18, 2014  3:11AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Well... yes, of course it is.</blockquote>\nNabokov would take you to task on this. <br/><br/>I suppose (a) is best route for promoting surreal material (rather than (b) a gonzo setting, or (c) silly pantomime - though they have qualities that could be lifted in a pinch).\n<blockquote><br/>You could probably do something similar with surreality, although if you chose (a) or (b) above you'll probably want to jumble, blend, or otherwise obscure the players' contributed elements, or they won't be very surprising when the players see them in play.

But, yeah, essentially the same thing - and that linking is exactly what's important here! Freudian uncanny/<i>unheimlich</i> is a great seam of RPG gold to mine. <br/><br/>As for what prompts the players in their creative activity? I'm thinking <i>Fiasco's</i> scenario generation would be a great model to start with.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429553/#Comment_429553" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-18T05:44:47+00:00" title="March 18, 2014  5:44AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2014 9:36AM by AsIf.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hear ya re the philosophic banter, but it is actually helping me think about this, because within that first question (a/b/c) is an implicit question about the "genealogy" of the surreality, and I think the implied answer is that allegories in play should frequently but unpredictably flux between temporarily stable states.  Here's why: If the elements of the surreal world are in some sense the "correct" signs for their signifieds (I assume this is what you meant by allegorically calling a spade a spade), then we would have a "stable surreal world" which would eventually fall into territory (b).  This is undesirable, because in general we want to stay in territory (a), right?  <br/><br/>We want to avoid stable signifiers in the long run, but, if our signifiers have no stability at all they become useless; communication and applied intention become impossible, and the game could not be played except by accident.  <br/><br/>So.  Perhaps there is some kind of dangerous dynamic tension or heuristic "wobble" between symbolic coupling and drift?  Perhaps affecting the balance of this relation has something to do with the purpose of the characters, or the enemies they oppose?  Perhaps if the PCs begin failing hard enough, the allegories become more and more random until the utility of their own perception approaches uselessness?  (And isn't this basically what a full-sensory schizoid hallucination does?)<br/><br/>We must be talking about a <i>process not a place</i>.  We're saying that there is no truly stable signifier for any given signified, that no matter how stable they seem at the time being, the allegories of a single session represent only one possible interpretation, and that even when an allegory "hits the mark" it's still subject to change and not necessarily the best or only, simply the most "powerful" at the moment, from the position and condition of the PCs.  (Foucault meets Korzybski.)<br/><br/>Which brings us back to a need for heavily-randomized and frequently-utilized systems and techniques, both in prep and in play.

The problem here is that we don't want the whole game to be in flux; we've established we want stable, everymen PCs which at the very least requires some concrete setting details. The real trouble here is that, unlike writing a cut-up piece of prose or drawing an exquisite corpse, we're trying to construct a method-to-narrative game. The essential nature of comprehensive narrative (which is what we want, after all, as story-gamers) means that it cannot be surrealist in a flux-based sense. The surreal engines at play need to be tightly watched and contained to elements of play to ensure they're <i>effective</i> in generating surreal sensations but not running rampant over stuff we want to be specifically un-surreal.  \n<blockquote><br/>But I mean, I think it's important to consider whether the goal is actual capital-s Surrealism or just the sort of modern 'surrealism as genre' approach, where really weird things happen and whoa they're so weird, clocks are like melting.

Capital-S Surrealism isn't better than 'surrealism as genre,' or rather, more precisely and importantly, it isn't better in terms of making gameplay. Surrealism-as-genre is probably better recognised as Weird Tales, psychedelia or some other sub-genre; Captial-S Surrealism is a historical movement whose legacy has seeped to different degrees into more modern stuff and changed over time. I'm not sure I want to dust off their historical principals without going over what's really applicable to roleplaying, and what's crap (there's a lot of crap. Consider me deeply suspicious about the integrity of historical Surrealism) and what'd produce the sensations/experiences I'd want in play. <br/><br/>In a nutshell: IMO, Surrealism as an entire creative philosophy is not conducive to making quality RPGs, but I feel no shame in wanting to lift the end-product Weirdness and co-opt it. &gt;:D                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429563/#Comment_429563" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-18T08:17:57+00:00" title="March 18, 2014  8:17AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>A lot of genre-agnostic games would work well for what you're describing as well, like <i>Solar System</i> or <i>Land of Nodd</i>.</blockquote>\nOr GURPS! <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429565/#Comment_429565" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-18T08:21:13+00:00" title="March 18, 2014  8:21AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Or GURPS! <br/></blockquote>\nOUT!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429568/#Comment_429568" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-18T08:32:02+00:00" title="March 18, 2014  8:32AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Capital-S Surrealism isn't better than 'surrealism as genre,' or rather, more precisely and importantly, it isn't better in terms of making gameplay. </blockquote>\nIt may not be better, but it could be different.

I think I'd like to arrange the lists and construct the method of their population in such a way that the GM only has to read from them to produce a surreal location or event.

Something like the A/B/M distinctions above, which the GM (or perhaps the players, too) use to generate some bizarre confluences. (Like the policeman who has a dog's paws, or whatever.)<br/><br/>This image becomes a location or an NPC or whatever: something important and/or meaningful for play.<br/><br/>Then generate a rule from that image. Perhaps in your surreality, all authority figures must have traits belonging to an animal that is symbolically "base" or normally seen a servant/lower form of life. <br/><br/>Now, the rules can be applied to the game in both directions: if someone is a figure of authority, you'd better give him a mosquito's wings, or rat whiskers. But if someone is described as having features of a certain type of animal, that likes allows you to generate more information about the character: they must be in some position of authority.<br/><br/>If your rules are generally applicable and/or semantically loose, this can generate a lot of direction for play. (Figures of authority and lower animals is a tad too specific to come up "accidentally", perhaps, unless you're playing a game where human/animal hybrids are very common.)<br/><br/>I like, for example, an association of a common colour with an emotion or circumstance: the colour yellow means danger, and vice-versa. <br/><br/>Now, add to each rule some kind of exception: "except when..."<br/><br/>The exceptions could be generated using some other kind of randomizer, and could include things like, "...except when Mike's character is in the scene", or "except on Fridays", or even, "except when dice are rolled in the scene, and any one comes up with a '1'."<br/><br/>Or, instead - or even as well - you could have some mechanic for changing which rules apply, so that the characters can move from scene to scene and be affected by different rules at different times or in different places. This could also be generated randomly, I suppose.<br/><br/>Now you have a basic framework, kind of like AW's Principles. Imagine GMing this kind of game with a list of 6-7 rules in front of you, and some kind of exception or trigger for switching to another set, or reversing one or two, or something similar. As a GM, you just refer to these to colour your contributions or inspire events (some themes, like "danger", will imply certain things happening), giving some coherence to the whole thing; and the inconsistency created by exceptions of rule changes can retain the surprise of surrealist incongruity for a while, if not indefinitely.<br/><br/><br/>(JD - Funniest comment I've read all day!

I like those ideas, Paul.]<br/><br/>All points valid so far, smarm und snark notwithstanding.  We're getting into a professionally/socially weird area now; it seems if we refer to any existing mechanic or structure (like saying "exquisite corpses" or "AW mech is just an allegory") we run the risk of being taken literally as having selected a particular approach, when really all we're doing is brainstorming, surveying potential game-ontological terrain, and listing ideas that <i>may be</i> related.  I doubt the actual surreality game will be written in its entirety right here on this thread, so relax, evvybuddy.<br/><br/>We haven't discussed any specific mechanic or even general game type in a really serious sense yet.  We're just doing what Mike suggested in the OP: "go over the terminology, get some examples and chat about surrealness in gaming generally."<br/><br/>When I distill the datapoints from Daniel's last posts, I get something like this: "If you want big S Surrealism, you should invent a weird, fertile and collaborative approach to generating content elements.  If you want small s surrealism, simply let the GM narrate weirdness as desired; there is no need for systematic approaches to this, they may turn out to be more restrictive than helpful."  Daniel, if I'm interpreting this as you intended it, then I don't necessarily disagree, but I also don't think we're done scattershotting.  I believe there's a middle ground.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429599/#Comment_429599" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-18T17:45:46+00:00" title="March 18, 2014  5:45PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2014 5:46PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I only meant that I myself had no <i>particular</i> need for systematic approaches to that -- not that they couldn't be helpful or fun, just that they were less interesting to me than a more experimental alternative.<br/><br/>I do agree that there is a lot of middle ground; I don't feel like there's a really hard line between the two goals I described, and in fact I feel like any 'genuinely' Surrealist technique is probably also going to produce adequate weirdness to fulfill a genre-y-er approach. I just also suspect that the more surreal the technique, the more surreal the result, as there is a very real cap on the amount of spontaneous, actually-genuinely-arresting surrealism one can generate out of one's conscious, deliberate head.<br/><br/>And of course there is also the possibility that nobody is particularly interested in actually-genuinely-arresting Andre-Breton-lives-on Surrealism -- or that in fact the basic arrangement of roleplaying as a collaborative activity <i>by itself</i> will elevate even deliberate attempts at weirdness into genuinely surreal moments, simply due to the presence of minds other than one's own, projecting their own version of things into or on top of yours. I do feel like wholesale commitment to someone else's vision of causality (eg. playing in a high-authority GMed game) is already fertile ground for surrealism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429600/#Comment_429600" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-18T18:08:51+00:00" title="March 18, 2014  6:08PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2014 6:23PM by Potemkin.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think I'm happy with anyone in this thread being called snark or smarmy, Aslf. That said, I'm gunna cool my jets and slow down on the posting - it's not really gracious to start a discussion and wade in with an opinion before it's even got going properly. New forum for me, new style of talking. \n<blockquote> the possibility that nobody is particularly interested in actually-genuinely-arresting Andre-Breton-lives-on Surrealism</blockquote>\nI think this is me, awkwardly. I don't find Straight and True Surrealism genuinely arresting in terms of RPGs and I'm much more interested in playing with it's cultural spin-offs, spoofs and techniques out of context. That's not to say I don't feel like it's not a great source of inspiration though! Does this make me disrespectful to important creative figures historically? Yeah, maybe. But I don't think anyone's too bothered about what Andre might think, right? I reckon playing with the fallout of Surrealism is genuinely arresting as both a designer and player, filled with plenty of emerging potential devices and ideas! Just keen for the discussion not to dismiss it out of hand in favour of Surrealism-proper, which plenty of games do really well already I'd say. <br/><br/><i>[Edit: I keep coming back to the above paragraph. I'm not happy with how I've expressed myself in it, but I'm going to leave it up anyway for discussion. I hope there might be an attempt to help me interpret my confused feelings about Surrealism.]</i><br/><br/>I'm gunna go dark, hopefully watch the discussion unfold and maybe offer my two cents once I've given it some long thought. <br/><br/>Aslf (or anyone interested, of course!), would you lead the way into talking about general game types or even specific mechanics? I'd be very grateful.

We're all grownups here and debating is helpful, but it's probably more helpful after some groundwork has been laid than it is while brainstorming.  There was a tone in some earlier post that you identified as feeling pejorative, and I turned up that feeling in an attempt to nudge us into a different emospace.  Guess I failed my roll.  What I meant was: When I disregard my kneejerks, both yours and Daniel's points are valid and sure to spur more conversation.<br/><br/>Anyway, as you've probably figured out already, I can't really stop myself from brainstorming on mechanical elements and taxonomical arrangements.  It's what I do, and I assure you I will continue to the best of my ability.

wish to contribute to thread (if they're not familiar with the terms you guys are using, or the references you're making, they may decline to post at all).<br/><br/>Perhaps it might be useful to list or brainstorm some examples of Surrealism that you find particularly compelling (a scene, a moment, an image, a premise...), and then let the brainpower of the people reading throw out some ideas for how that kind of thing might be generated in a game.<br/><br/>In any case, I'd love to hear some examples, as I have no clue what the difference between "Big S Surrealism" and "Surrealism-proper" and whatever else might be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div

Paul.  The OP features a beautiful image by Moebius (the late Jean Giraud), brilliant illustrator and author of "The Airtight Garage of Jerry Cornelius" and many other things, to whom Mike alluded in the OP.  Those of you who remember Heavy Metal magazine in the 80s will certainly remember this strip, it was his magnum opus.  In the strip, Jerry Cornelius (name later changed due a perceived snub by Michael Moorcock) adventures within a massive asteroid housing a pocket universe which contains hundreds of worlds, all with different forms of life, types of people, and laws of physics, some of them still forming.  It gets super weird, in beautiful and funny ways.<br/><br/>Before diving back into mechanical/game design issues again I'll back up a little bit.  You asked about big-S Surrealism.  I think Daniel got that into a small nutshell very well:\n<blockquote>...the mechanical creation of surreal images was... what the Surrealists spent most of their time doing. Automatic writing, question-and-answer games, exquisite corpse, and the like [...]  The key theme of all these exercises was the removal of conscious agency and choice; precisely to avoid someone (say, the GM) deciding which elements 'should' go together, or would be 'most weird' or whatever. The suggestion (or fervent belief, whichever) of the Surrealists being that this bypassing-of-consciousness would allow the subconscious reality of the mind to show through.</blockquote>\nOne example many people are familiar with, even if they didn't know the name, is "Exquisite Corpses".  In this game, you all take turns adding a word, sentence or paragraph to an ongoing text (the size of the desired text is predetermined before play begins), but you aren't allowed to look at what was written before (or you are only allowed to see the last bit of it).  It can also be played with drawings: You draw a head (without showing it to anyone), then fold the paper over so the next person can only see the two little lines where the neck ends... then they draw the torso, fold the paper so only the hip-lines are showing, and the third person draws the legs.  Maybe not the best example of a Surrealistic mechanic, but it's a good enough starting-point: basically we're talking about bypassing conscious intent in order to access subconscious "truth" and generate dream-like symbolism that is both surprising and evocative, even for its own creators.<br/><br/>A possible tangent that occurs to me is the difference between "removal of conscious agency" and "subconscious reality showing through" - they are not necessarily the same thing.  For example: We all remove our own conscious agency whenever we reach for the dice, but only <i>some</i> of us believe that our unconscious minds can influence the result of that roll.<br/><br/>So what Daniel was pointing out earlier is that Big-S Surrealism could really only arise from a mechanic that was radically and consciously blind.  Such "blindness" may be suitable for some types of collaborative/freeform storygames, but it would be <i>much</i> trickier to do it within a typical RPG mechanic.  On the other hand, we have "small-s surrealism" ("Twin Peaks" might be a good example) which over time tends to verge into either (a) direct allegory, or (b) a weird world but a totally stable one ("You can use a snail as a radio?  Ok then, I use my snail to call for help").  Once you get used to it, it's no longer surreal for you.  It's just fiction.  That's why I kept prattling on about "flux" and randomizing mechanisms, although both Mike and Daniel pointed out (in different ways) that these techniques would have to be carefully designed and managed, lest they devolve into meaninglessness, or cause more problems than they solve.<br/><br/>So part of the confusion thus far has been in separating those two meanings of the S word.  This has been paralleled by a discussion about the "scope" of surreality that might work in various game types, and some brainstorming on mechanics.  You can ignore the stuff about Foucault and Nabokov.<br/><br/>I think that should catch everyone up.  We now return you to your regularly-scheduled programming!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429620/#Comment_429620" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-18T23:29:28+00:00" title="March 18, 2014 11:29PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>Yeah, I don't think it's that important. Let's get back to the more general topic.<br/><br/>My favourite suggestion so far is to make use of player-generated images and ideas to guide GM-curated/introduced elements. Repurposing the players' ideas in unfamiliar ways is a great way to evoke surreal reactions, and mimic a certain quality of dreams -- that they seem like they are some part of you, talking to you from outside yourself.<br/><br/>The game that this brings to mind most clearly is <i>A Penny For My Thoughts</i>, which IMO is the closest thing we currently have to a straight up surrealist sci-fi game. But the thing is that it is not superficially* surreal, in that usually the moment-to-moment narratives that are described tend to be fairly realistic. But the underlying mode of play -- where you 'remember' things for the first time, and then are forced to give up agency at the very moment where your actions are most decisive -- is extremely surreal. And of course the basic premise is also squarely in the sci-fi/surreality camp.<br/><br/>And, tying things back in, it also makes use of exactly the technique mentioned above -- the seeds for all the memories are player-generated sensations/images/phrases that they write down in advance, with absolutely no context for their usage in the game. The players are simply told to write down something short and evocative. Now whenever I play <i>Penny</i>, I almost invariably write down a striking sensation from my own personal experience -- whether my actual history/memory, or just something that is vivid to me in that moment of play -- and equally invariably this adds a layer of surreality to the scenes where that sensation is re-introduced and made into the basis of somebody else's life.<br/><br/>So I think anyone who is interested in producing evocative surrealist play should at a minimum read/play <i>Penny</i> and think about how/why it works. And I think a big part of why it works is the combination of a) soliciting player-generated, immediate (i.e. if not subconscious then at least not premeditated) sensations <i>and then</i> b) introducing those elements in a context of deeply-personal identity-altering moments, whose underlying mechanics are actively undermining the players'/characters' feelings of control over the situation at hand. Combining loss of control with deep investment in identity means that the players are motivated to invest the results with meaning, even though the meaning is coming from unexpected and exterior sources. <br/><br/>If there's no investment, there's no reason to try and figure out what the surreal situation means; it can just mean nothing, it can just be a crazy melting clock. Penny creates the investment with a super-grabby premise -- the whole game is about figuring out who you are, and every scene is clearly presented as crucially important to answering the question.<br/><br/><br/>* And I mean literally on the surface, not 'without substance' or anything like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429622/#Comment_429622" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-18T23:59:08+00:00" title="March 18, 2014 11:59PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2014 12:12AM by AsIf.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sidenote not far from this topic: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy text game is back online:<br/><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1g84m0sXpnNCv84GpN2PLZG/the-hitchhiker-s-guide-to-the-galaxy-game-30th-anniversary-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1g84m0sXpnNCv84GpN2PLZG/the-hitchhiker-s-guide-to-the-galaxy-game-30th-anniversary-edition</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429661/#Comment_429661" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-20T00:04:09+00:00" title="March 20, 2014 12:04AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 20, 2014 12:06AM by AsIf.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>DISCLAIMER: This is another meta post.  Sue me.</i><br/><br/>I think we actually have two sets of questions going on here, which shouldn't be surprising since the whole field has this fuzzy dichotomy between "RPGs" and "storygames" (scarequotes to indicate I'm being pithy for rhetorical purposes).  Like a variation on that famous supreme court definition of pornography, the line is something that we can't define (because everywhere we look we see examples of games that step blatantly across it).  But we also can't deny that the field of interactive/fictional/narrative/collaboration/immersion design possesses two core bodies of thought and approach, which are situated in what seems like diametrical opposition to each other.  So we have:<br/><br/>1. Questions of the application of surreality to "storygames" in the sense of collaborative emergent fiction with roleplaying in it.  Here, as in the "Penny For My Thoughts" example above, a sense of surreality can be brought about directly by the way players interact with the rules (independently of whether the fiction itself seems surreal).<br/><br/>2. Questions of the application of surreality to "RPGs" in the sense of simulated fictional worlds (or universes, or multiverses) with roleplaying in them.  In the OP, this was referred to obliquely as "a more grounded/trad play procedure", in which we might expect to feel the sense of surreality arising more indirectly, i.e. coming more from the fiction itself.<br/><br/>I expect that the answers to these two sets of questions will be very different, even though we all blur that line on a daily basis.  It's kinda like racism.  It's not there, but it's there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429666/#Comment_429666" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-20T04:39:09+00:00" title="March 20, 2014  4:39AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My feeling is that I'm keen on (2) but being informed by the conceptual mechanisation that goes on in (1).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TinyAltar" title="TinyAltar"><img alt="TinyAltar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/982/nWZQ6FASSSU1Y.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TinyAltar">TinyAltar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429671/#Comment_429671" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-20T08:58:18+00:00" title="March 20, 2014  8:58AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting discussion here! And actually, seeing this discussion is what gave me the push to finally join Story Games. Hope it's okay I'm jumping in here.<br/><br/>When considering systems or rules that might simulate the surreal, pacing mechanisms immediately come to mind. In many Philip K. Dick stories, reality gradually unravels to reveal (sort of a tongue twister: reality, unravel, reveal) something that was previously concealed. What is real and what isn't? Glimpses of the surreal, or clues to an alternate reality/existence, often begin as minor things. These minor things could even be confused with a character's paranoia. Over time, clues or glimpses into the surreal become more intense, until they seamlessly blend with what the character knows to be real, and the entire fabric of reality begins to be questioned.<br/><br/>In this sense, surreal doesn't have to be melting clocks and crazy visuals. It can also be feelings and a gradual decay of reality. The most common pacing mechanism, hit points, could reflect a growing detachment to reality and thus an increase in surreal happenings. Or, it could mean that, amidst surreal happenings/environments, the character is gradually becoming unhinged and integrated with that reality, and thus distant from a stable starting point. Again, I think the most interesting aspects of surreal settings are the way they make characters <i>feel</i>, and not necessarily what they <i>see</i>.<br/><br/>I'm interested in keeping the human element attached to the surreal. Whether the surreal be a product of one's imagination or paranoia, it can be a powerful and engaging agent if rules are <i>attached</i> to an environment -- but not <i>static</i>. Surrealism isn't necessarily random. It does have basis in the human experience, and is dependent on the thoughts and ideas of those who experience it. And the idea of surreal environments having their own set of pacing tools (sort of making them into fluid NPCs) is appealing.<br/><br/>I'd like to bring up <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5FrC0OzZ32ablFndFFQVV9iNG8/edit" rel="nofollow"><i>Visitors &amp; Visions</i></a> -- it's certainly related, and I hope this can somehow add to this discussion. Given the limitations of it being conceived and created in 48 hours, the game is far from perfect, but it's an idea I want to expand upon in the future. Even though it did get 1st place in the contest, I still haven't heard of anyone actually <i>playing</i> it.<br/><br/>Anyway, in that, the "visitors" -- the PCs -- can introduce ideas to the "vision" -- a collection of linked, surreal environments. In this way, the visions are not static and they blend with the visitors they are hosting. Some other concepts include the ability for PCs to gradually "grasp" a vision (this is positive, and represents a healthy understanding of the vision and an ability to more effectively operate within it), or "drift" into the mental abyss (this is negative, and represents becoming unhinged from the vision).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429688/#Comment_429688" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-21T05:09:21+00:00" title="March 21, 2014  5:09AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome, welcome to Story Games dotOrg!

"Expect the unexpected." I prefer this not only because of the narrative possibilities, but also because the surreal will feel more surreal if the narrative is originally grounded in "reality" from character perspective, or at least grounded in what they believe to be normal occurrence (to us, linked mental states/visions/dreams are hardly normal, but to visitors, it's what they are trained for). If everything is batsh** crazy from the get-go, that's not surreal. That's just a different kind of reality. Surreal is the degradation and/or the twisting of reality, which ought to be the base of the experience.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, emotions are initially internal to the characters and dependent on the environment. "How well do you deal with the unexpected?" But I imagine that emotions can sort of "snowball" in a sense. Once a complicated emotion is introduced, it can be difficult to escape from it (but by no means impossible). In the surreal, loss of control and a feeling of helplessness are to be expected ("Drift" and "Doubts" in V&amp;V). So, I suppose it's how the characters deal with that helplessness -- and how efficiently they integrate with it, if at all -- that ultimately evokes the emotions they feel. So sure, varied emotions seem natural. I'm certainly not advocating a black-and-white "happy start, scary finish" dynamic. [Side note: The idea of "lost" and "found" is a major reason why I chose to use navigational/seafaring/sailing terminology for many concepts.]\n<blockquote>Oh wow! Visitors and Visions is amazing!

It definitely needs some work (read: <i>a lot of work</i>).<br/><br/>Hopefully, I've partially answered your question on design principles. One thing I'd like to add is simply "fun" as a principle. I wanted that cerebral, emotional connection to the surreal, but I also acknowledge that visuals and oddball character features can be immensely entertaining (thus, Avatar Features).\n<blockquote>Could this method be used for a more "stable" setting, such as being established before play begins, do you think?</blockquote>\nWhen reading through this thread initially, I remember someone mentioning ideas being put into a hat at the beginning of a session or game, and gradually drawn as they are introduced. I (respectfully) have a couple problems with this, such as: 1) The random element; I don't believe that surreal necessarily equates to random, at least not with something as extreme as ideas, and 2) The fact that they are pre-written ideas, and are thus incapable of changing or morphing depending on the surreal elements experienced up to that point during the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429695/#Comment_429695" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-21T10:05:12+00:00" title="March 21, 2014 10:05AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's one of my favourite genres too!

You'd ask him what they were like, and they'd have to respond by drawing an adjective ("sticky") or maybe a noun ("kettle").

To clarify: In <i>Visitors &amp; Visions</i>, the GM invents the visions, as well as all environments that exist within that vision. The characters can only introduce ideas to the vision. The caveat here is that each idea is subject to die rolls that determine their effectiveness/"true-ness" to what the PC intended. And yes, this means ideas backfire, and sometimes they are <i>extremely</i> distorted when being introduced to the vision -- so much so that they only have a slight resemblance to the intended result.<br/><br/>And this is why introducing ideas at certain milestones is <i>required</i>, not suggested. It implies helplessness and an inability for the character to control their thoughts and fears within a vision. An idea that is flawlessly introduced (a good roll) is rare. Ideas that somewhat resemble what the character intended, but have some consequences are most common. And ideas that completely backfire are just as rare as the flawlessly introduced one (a terrible roll).<br/><br/>Ideas, at least in V&amp;V, are not so extreme that they allow the players to create their weirdness. Players can slightly control (actually, the phrase I would use is "narratively suggest") weird elements introduced into the overarching vision, but these ideas by no means eliminate the sense of unfolding surprise within that overall vision. To me, it's an attempted (stress on "attempted") balance between the unpredictability of surreal environments, as well as the human element of being "sucked into" the surreal -- when the surreal begins to fuzzily mimic a character's complexity, albeit often in inexplicable ways.<br/><br/>Of course, what's good for my little game definitely isn't good for every game, and "surreal" has varying interpretations. Still, hope these thoughts can add something to the discourse!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429704/#Comment_429704" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-21T11:27:02+00:00" title="March 21, 2014 11:27AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://cdn.bleedingcool.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/The-Nighmare-Before-Christmas.jpg?9098e0"/><br/><br/><i><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=31901.0" rel="nofollow">What's this!?</a></i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429707/#Comment_429707" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-21T11:38:43+00:00" title="March 21, 2014 11:38AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2014 11:45AM by Potemkin.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really want a copy of <i>Sign In Stranger</i>, where can I get one? \n<blockquote><br/>Of course, what's good for my little game definitely isn't good for every game, and "surreal" has varying interpretations.

In that story, the other realm was so incomprehensible to the human mind that the majority of travelers who came back were left traumatized, in a state of catatonia.  Others returned dead.  So maybe that's what can happen at worst, eh?<br/><br/>Let's see...  For each Daytrip, we might need to...<br/>- Determine axes of slippage<br/>- Determine degree of slippage along each axis<br/>- Determine the resulting "reality type"<br/>- Determine specific details, hardships, and maguffins<br/>- Create Locations/NPCs/Objects/Events<br/><br/>When I say "Determine", I'm talking about something that could be a random process with a solo GM (roll on charts, draw cards, etc), or it could be a collaborative group process, or some combination of the two (structured brainstorming, etc).  For a more narrativistic approach, you might leave out the creation of specifics and just "play to find out" (taking input from the players, perhaps intermingled with your own determinations, etc).  I think either approach could produce an interesting game (and the backstory definitely allows enough room for tons of cool stories to arise).  But unless some funky content-processing mechanics are implemented, I'm pretty sure that the more input players have into these decisions, the less surprising (and therefore the less "surreal") the resulting experiences will seem to them subjectively.<br/><br/>ETA: I just reminded myself of the tables for generating "Alternate Prime Material Planes" in TSR's "Manual of the Planes" (Appendix I).  It's a ridiculous mechanic and I'm probably in the wrong place to even mention it, but it's a sort-of precedent, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429717/#Comment_429717" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-21T18:27:54+00:00" title="March 21, 2014  6:27PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re "Sign in Stranger":<br/>I wrote to Emily Care Boss, and she tells me she has plans to bring it back into print this year.

Each is painted a garish colour and prepped to "shift" along an angle of slippage into a crazy new plane of existence.

When I tried my surreal roleplaying game, even I who made the game got a strange feeling while game mastering it. What I did was that I mentioned things without describing them closely, as they didn't stand out for the normal citizen of the  world. Lalar that crawled under the roofs, the darkness that fled away in the alley, the tiny humans that replaced the birds during night time. It all sow a special feeling that the players sucked up. They accepted without understanding it, and contributed with imaginations of their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429728/#Comment_429728" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-22T08:26:24+00:00" title="March 22, 2014  8:26AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2014 8:31AM by AsIf.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>How much would this game overlap with "Time and Temp", I wonder?</blockquote>\nI don't think it's too a big of an overlap.

Someday. That would be good fun. Hopefully I'll be able to set something up sooner than later. Weekends are my only breathing time lately, and lately those are spent working on another project.\n<blockquote>Is this why you've expressed misgivings about the pulling-in-out-the-hat world generation?

In the case of the latter, which is what you seem to be interested in, those world generation ideas are more practical. Actually, I might even be hesitant to give the players/characters <i>any</i> input into world/dimension generation (as Aslf mentioned above, more input = less surprise). For linked minds and mental states, PC input of ideas makes narrative sense, but for charting unknown worlds and dimensions, the degree of collaboration really depends on the level of shock and surprise you want to give your PCs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429730/#Comment_429730" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-22T08:44:15+00:00" title="March 22, 2014  8:44AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 22, 2014 9:18AM by AsIf.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>depends on the level of shock and surprise you want to give your PCs.</blockquote>Yes, and yet...

Your post is spot-on as well.

You nailed it, and if you think about it I bet most of us here have done this same thing in the past.  Start with rather general descriptions of things, and watch to see which ones the players click to.  Give them a little bit of detail and watch to see what details they add on all by themselves.

It's like tinkering with the most highly publicized toolbox ever! Resources are endless. Totally not a cop-out for an initial pitch to resemble embryonic D&amp;D: the characters, motivations and activities are as about straight-forward as you could want. No saving the world. No examination of childhood trauma. Just the desire for success and profit within fictional constraints. It's pretty much a universal motive, but I wouldn't be terribly upset if it morphed into something more nuanced. I mean, <i>The Mountain Witch</i> is a simple D&amp;D premise on paper (explore the dungeon, kill the monster!) but as we know has rules that drive much, much deeper. \n<blockquote>I like where you're going with this.

Then\u2026<br/>\u2022\tGive it different input or from a difference source<br/>\u2022\tMake it create a different kind of output<br/>\u2022\tMake it run on an impossible fuel source<br/>\u2022\tMake it produce organic things<br/>\u2022\tMake it intelligent, emotional, or communicative<br/>\u2022\tHave it be controlled by a natural law or process<br/>\u2022\tMake it ridiculously large or small<br/><br/><b>TWEAKING CHARACTERS</b>:<br/>Think of a person, archetype, or character, or look at the characters in the scene and choose one.  Then\u2026<br/>\u2022\tAlter their age<br/>\u2022\tAlter their gender<br/>\u2022\tGive them an animal part<br/>\u2022\tGive them a machine or tool part<br/>\u2022\tPut a machine inside them<br/>\u2022\tGive them a purely symbolic part<br/>\u2022\tFuse them with another person or role<br/>\u2022\tTake away their greatest asset<br/>\u2022\tTurn their emotions up to 11 or down to 0<br/>\u2022\tEnhance one of their skills to legendary levels<br/>\u2022\tSwap their function with another person or type<br/>\u2022\tInvert, replace or conflict their core motivation<br/>\u2022\tPut them inside something symbolic or alive<br/>\u2022\tRemove something important from them<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430587">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/uolmir" title="uolmir"><img alt="uolmir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/uolmir">uolmir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430587/#Comment_430587" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-06T16:21:39+00:00" title="April  6, 2014  4:21PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reading this thread had got me thinking about incorporating magical realism (not surrealism, but close). Specifically, I'm thinking about something Murakami does a few times where two worlds exist in parallel, one the everyday world and the other dreamlike. Perhaps the characters are transposed between the two at random or by GM fiat. In fact, maybe it's not even immediately obvious that they've moved across. Depending on the specific flavor of unreality of the parallel world, they might not notice until they tried to touch something or reached into their pockets for something that's no longer there. The parallel world gives them a different way to approach their problems (it prevents some actions, but allows others that are impossible in the normal world). And the parallel world is just as dangerous, perhaps more so, than the normal one.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430591/#Comment_430591" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-06T18:44:24+00:00" title="April  6, 2014  6:44PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            uolmir, you may be interested in Itras By.

However, I have three things to mention for inspiration.<br/><br/>Bizarro fiction, specifically books like Carlton Mellick III writes. Seems right up the alley of bizarre cult like surrealism. It's very NSFW and pornographic at points but why not, no worse than Metabarons. <a href="http://carltonmellick.com/books/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://carltonmellick.com/books/</a><br/><br/>Which leads to Alejandro Jodorowsky. His comic series Metabarons might as well be considered surreal sci fi, it's way off the map. As well as his movies like Holy Mountain, though it's not sci fi it is surreal.<br/><br/>Lastly, an amazing comic book from the Heavy Metal books is Requiem Chevalier Vampire. His artwork and stories have a very painting like surreal quality to them. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem_Chevalier_Vampire" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem_Chevalier_Vampire</a><br/><br/>And that's about all I have. If you are not aware of the above, then happy You day! If you were already aware, then others can learn. Enjoy and let us know how the surreal gaming goes.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19279/lets-talk-about-surreal-sci-fi" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19279/lets-talk-about-surreal-sci-fi" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19279/lets-talk-about-surreal-sci-fi/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19279%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19279%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
