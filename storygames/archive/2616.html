That same night we played Subversive Words for the second time, with Jim taking Stacy\xe2\u20ac\u2122s place. The two games are from my series Heads of State: nine short games about tyrants<br/><br/>** O'm looking for outside playtesters- game drafts available at <a href="http://www.headsofstate.net/?page_id=6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.headsofstate.net/?page_id=6</a><br/><br/>Palace Gates<br/><br/>Since most of our earlier playtests had been set in Latin American bananas republics or small Carpathian monarchies, we wanted to set down in a more far-flung region. Someone suggested Indonesia and we decided to feature long-serving dictator General Suharto, without having to hew to his real history. My character was an Indonesian soldier visiting the capital during leave. Judson\xe2\u20ac\u2122s was an Australian security consultant who had been hired to upgrade motion detectors in the palace. Joshua was an American tourist who wanted to grab a souvenir (to sell on ebay of course). Stacy\xe2\u20ac\u2122s character was employed at the site as a groundskeeper. <br/><br/>We each provided a visible feature of the palace or a rumor about what it was like inside:<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2 Located on an island connected to the capital by a causeway<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2 Most of the palace is located underground<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2 Suharto has a disturbed brother who was kept hidden within<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2 Palace looks like a mosque<br/><br/>Players take turns rolling for an object found in the dictators residence and describe how it was found, then weave a story about the Tyrant inspired by the item. Other players can propose amendments to the story, offering tokens as inducements for the speaking player to accept the changes. Some of the objects/stories included:<br/><br/>- Scene two: prosthetic leg = the mistress had lost her leg from the knee down when her parent\xe2\u20ac\u2122s house was bombed. Amendment: the mistress didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t lose her leg in an explosion, Suharto had it cut off. Second amendment: you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re slandering our leader- the mistresses\xe2\u20ac\u2122 father lost his leg in an accident and the general generously paid for the prosthetic (as he did for many of the nations\xe2\u20ac\u2122 poor), then after dad died, the mistress kept it as a momento. (Josh also got a bonus token for referencing the mistress I introduced in scene one).<br/>- Scene four: Brail new testament = a library containing just bibles in all the world\xe2\u20ac\u2122s languages because the general is devout. Amendment: he\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a devout muslim so the bibles had all been confiscated from missionaries.<br/><br/>For the second round we added two additional story elements to each scene (chosen by the players to the left and right of the narrating player. The two categories were literary devices and images/art. <br/><br/>- Scene five: jar of skin whitening cream + foreshadowing + cherry blossoms = the dictator suffered from cancer and used to sit in a robe (gift of the Japanese ambassador) before a mirror after treatment so attendants could mask his skin lesions with cream. <br/>- Scene seven: caged automata of a bird + anomonopeia + Picasso\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Guernica = Suharto was in Spain during civil war and took the automata from a house damaged by the \xe2\u20ac\u02dcbang\xe2\u20ac\u2122 of a bombing raid as a symbol of how a forceful leader can bring order to his nation.<br/><br/>Stacy and Judson ended the game tied with the most tokens so they got to collaborate on a final scene revealing how the tyrant died. <br/><br/>Unit of blood = the characters find Suharto\xe2\u20ac\u2122s corpse, a unit of blood still hooked up to his arm. The autopsy reveals that while he was in the late stages of cancer, he had succumbed to poison planted in his face whitening cream. {thus validating his foreshadowed death, but with a twist}<br/><br/>As in earlier playtests, players were able to spin some neat stories and it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s fun being challenged by objects/elements. Suggesting amendments added an interesting spin to some of the stories although it wasn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t high pressure one-upmanship like Baron Munschausen for example. <br/><br/>Design notes: <br/><br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2 Josh noted that the currency of tokens/amendments is a problem because you have an incentive to keep your starting tokens and never offer amendments to other players\xe2\u20ac\u2122 stories. A decent solution is to not count your starting tokens towards your final score- so you don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t have an incentive to hoard them. Perhaps there should be an incentive to offer them (beyond interest in the story).<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2 The current rules give each player one starting token per other player. Have a set number of starting tokens per player or a total starting number regardless of how many players there are (otherwise in games with a lot of players, there will be too many tokens and a tendency to drag out scenes)<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2 Probably better to transition in one story element at a time: just object, then object + 1 element, etc.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60119/#Comment_60119" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-09T08:48:53+00:00" title="March  9, 2007  8:48AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Subversive words<br/><br/>SW has two sides: events in the life of a dissident writer (or other creative person), and the story they are creating in a new work in progress on the theme of the tyrant. We kept this game in the same setting as palace gates so we needed to create a dissident/underground creative type as the main character for half of the game. We chose an elderly female muralist/street artist, best known for a salt painting of imperial occupation and oppression. Because the work could also be interpreted as an allegory of the Suharto regime, the painting had been erased after a week and only 6 photographs of it exist. The artist\xe2\u20ac\u2122s current work is a triptych of three street murals that she was planning to paint in three separate neighborhoods of Jakarta. (We chose three to set the length of the game: three scenes in the artist\xe2\u20ac\u2122s life and three inside the world of her artwork.)<br/><br/>We started in the artist\xe2\u20ac\u2122s life. The system in this half of the game is that players spend tokens (scrabble pieces) to move a game piece around a wheel of 16 emotions and have to narrate events that would cause the artist character to experience that emotion. For example, the first such scene progressed from:<br/>Anticipation = the artist gathered her chalk and set out towards the site she has chosen for her first mural in the series<br/>Optimism = she stops by her son\xe2\u20ac\u2122s house along the way and is happy and hopeful to play with her grandson for a while<br/>Disappointment = reaching the location for her first mural (her grandson\xe2\u20ac\u2122s school) she finds that a ceremony is underway in the school yard and she cannot start her work<br/>Surprise = why are there so many soldiers here at the school?<br/>Fear = the soldiers start going through the gathered crowd, asking for id papers<br/><br/>We jumped into the world of the mural. We had picked a group of characters to feature in the mural half of the game: a solider, a young woman, a farmer, and a demon. In this half of the game, players choose scrabble pieces from their hand, pick a key word that starts with the chosen letter, and then narrate based on the key word. I assumed that we would be recounting what happened to the characters in the art almost in the same way as if they were characters in a book. But the other three players steered us in a much better direction, describing the actual physical mural in terms of colors and location in the image. For example, the first scene \xe2\u20ac\u02dcinside\xe2\u20ac\u2122 the art was:<br/>D = demon = a red demonic figure looms at top of the mural<br/>M = marriage = below, the soldier and girl stand hand in hand<br/>P = paint = an undercoat of orange paint gives everything in the mural an energetic glow<br/>T = treeline = the demon sets fire to the forest, it spreads towards the couple<br/>A = an angelic figure deflects the fire with its sword<br/>R = run = the couple flees from the conflagration <br/>G = group = a group of torchbearing figures cut off the couple\xe2\u20ac\u2122s escape<br/>L = a blue lake blocks their only other route to safety<br/>S = steam from the fire reaching the lakeshore obscures a bridge over the water <br/><br/>In the second scene in the artist\xe2\u20ac\u2122s life, she is interrogated by a soldier, flees to a slum area of the capital to paint the second mural and comes to terms with the fact that few art lovers will come there to see her work. <br/><br/>In the second scene inside the mural, hundreds of children are menaced by a surreal military marching band (Josh only had an X scrabble piece and went for xylophone as the key word), the couple look on in horror and flee cowardly as the backdrop of the mural changes from the surrounding slums to the government buildings of the capital to a vast mausoleum.<br/><br/>In the final scene in the artist\xe2\u20ac\u2122s life, she wanders randomly through the city, regretting that she will probably die soon and that her work has had little impact, then she looks up in surprise and sees the vast white walls of the tyrant\xe2\u20ac\u2122s palace, but never gets to start her final mural there, succumbing to a heart attack when a soldier accosts her.<br/><br/>The final mural is never painted but the soldier who stopped her looks through her sketchbooks and sees her plans for it. Bombs (inscribed with images of western bankers) explode in the background as the demon removes its mask to reveal a young Suharto. The woman in the mural is here dressed as a nun, and her face is the face of the artist as a young lady. Her soldier lover is shown with his face blank- in the sketchbook there are many attempts at drawing him, but the artist apparently never got it right. <br/><br/>Once again, this game worked well at producing an inside/outside story of sorts. The letters and emotion are nice as inspirations/creative constraints. The rules for spending and laying down pieces to move round the emotional wheel in the artist\xe2\u20ac\u2122s life section are still not great. The modification we tried half way through, with pieces seeded on each emotion you move through, has promise and I will fiddle with it. <br/><br/>Design notes:<br/><br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2 The first player picks a starting location on the wheel and the rest should get to put a tile on their choice of one emotion to pre-seed the wheel. <br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2 System should promote motion and reversals of emotion but it would also be nice to tend to have each scene cluster in a band of emotions rather than use them all willy nilly.<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2 When you move, place one tile in each emotion you pass through, not on the one you end up in. Then if you or another player later moves to one of the seeded spaces, they take the tiles there. <br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2 Still costs three to reverse across the wheel<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2 Maybe when you run out of tiles in the art world, you don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t get to draw a new hand of 6, you only get one at a time, so you really have an incentive to collect good ones in the artist\xe2\u20ac\u2122s world. Keep tiles face up on the wheel so players try to get good letters? <br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2 Along same lines, maybe you should not be able to have more than 6-7 in your hand so you have incentive to move around and dump crappy letters in the wheel<br/>\xe2\u20ac\xa2 Or maybe the currency of the tiles isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t really important since the choice of letters and emotions is what the game is and should be about, not collecting the right tiles                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60140/#Comment_60140" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-09T09:55:20+00:00" title="March  9, 2007  9:55AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's HoS?
