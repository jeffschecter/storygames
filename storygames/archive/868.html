                    To celebrate our finishing playtesting all nine of Heads of State's games, I'm prefacing the play report with a nursery rhyme summarizing the nine games in the order we played. The trial game play test is presented in my next post<br/>
<br/>
Nine little tyrants pining for their states<br/>
One returned from exile and then there were eight.<br/>
Eight little tyrants abducting the press<br/>
Clues were pieced together and then there was one less<br/>
Seven little tyrants watching theatrics<br/>
One became a critic and then there were six<br/>
Six little tyrants had sumptuous places to live<br/>
One was evicted and then there were five<br/>
Five little tyrants lying at deathÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s door<br/>
One passed over and then there were four<br/>
Four little tyrants enshrined in biographies<br/>
One was reinterpreted and then there were three <br/>
Three little tyrants facing a bold coup<br/>
One got overthrown and then there were two<br/>
Two little tyrants went driving in the sun<br/>
One was cut down a size and then there was one<br/>
One little tyrant charged by the U.N.<br/>
Once he was convicted then there were none.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Josh, Judson and I play tested the last two games from my collection Heads of State: nine short games about Tyrants. Both games featured Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe star of liberty,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ a fictional Uruguayan dictator that Alex had created back during the first session and who had reappeared during tests of the Disappeared, Palace Gates, and As I lay Dying. <br/>
<br/>
The star didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fare well this night. He was hacked to death with agricultural implements during our first game; then reassembled for our second game so he could be hauled before a international tribunal.<br/>
<br/>
Sic Semper Tyrannus is a game of assassination. Players are members of a conspiratorial cell dedicated to slaying the despot. The game centers on the challenges of planning an assassination plot through garbled communication channels. <br/>
<br/>
The game has a GM. Since there were three of us and a 2-person conspiracy wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite test all the angles of communication, I was Gm and ran a character. <br/>
<br/>
We started by assigning points to the Tyrants traits: paranoia, security, and luck. He ended up having a paranoia rating of 3 and security of 7.<br/>
<br/>
Character creation is also done by assigning points in three categories: the charactersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ positions in the regime, in society, and in the conspiracy. Judson made Manuel, a coffee grower whose fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plantation had been nationalized. Josh was Jean-Baptiste, an anarchist working in the dictatorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s motorpool, and my character was Louis, a bitter bureaucrat in the dept of public works. <br/>
<br/>
JoshÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s character had the highest conspiracy core so he became the leader of the conspiracy, Ã¢â‚¬ËœhandlingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Manuel and Louis. Josh started the action by sending messages (writing notes) to the two of us. Every time messages are sent in the game the sending player flips 4 coins. If you get 4 heads the message goes through perfectly. The more tails that turn up, the more the message is altered by one of the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s garbling methods (translation, crossing out some words, or limiting the length of the message). Our favorite was translation (putting the message through an online translator then printing it out.)<br/>
<br/>
As an example, here is the first message my character received from JoshÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s at the beginning of play: Ã¢â‚¬Å“for the commander from consorting with the men of the part of the hills to suppose of the father of emergency in order to organize, therefore like the test of the blessing of the commander. If assessed its fall, in order to communicate, authorizing one review of the motor for the Royce bearing.Ã¢â‚¬Â  Judson and Josh were able to communicate, albeit with some difficulties, but after 3 rounds of back and forth Josh and I kept rolling badly and I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t figure out what my character was being asked to do. <br/>
In the fourth round all 3 of us met in person, limited to 30 seconds talking, and I was quickly clued into the plan. <br/>
<br/>
Next each player described what their character was doing in the run up to the assassination attempt. Louis accused the father of the head of internal security of treason to cause turmoil in the dictatorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bodyguards. Jean-Baptiste got an ally assigned as the starÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s driver. And Manuel waited with a few farmhands to waylay the car when it passed by his farm. As GM I awarded us each 2 coins since our characters were contributing to the plan in a solid manner and utilizing our backgrounds. I gave an extra coin (out of possible 3) to Josh to reward the moderate creativity of the plan. We flipped our collective 7 coins, counting heads. I flipped the tyrants 3 paranoia coins to find out if the plan was creative enough to even get a shot at the dictator, plus his 5 or 6 suspicion coins that had accumulated when we met in person and went past 3 rounds of planning.  We got more heads that the suspicion coins, so our characters were not caught before they could try the plan; and we also got a lot more than the dictatorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s paranoia result. On to the actual assassination attempt. <br/>
<br/>
JudsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s character was the only one on the scene of the attempt so he described how Manuel and his laborers flagged down the TyrantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s limo, dragged the leader from his car, and started chopping. I again awarded 2 coins to each player and threw in one bonus coin for a modestly strategic plan. We flipped the player coins (and could each re-flip one by drawing on our motivation) and barely beat the tyrantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seven security coins (the tyrant can reflip a number of coins equal to his luck rating). Therefore the attempt succeeded and Justin narrated the successful, bloody act of tyrannicide. <br/>
<br/>
We discussed some rules changes, including some that I think will be big steps forward and a few crazily inspired modifications:<br/>
* first round communication should start with 2 or 3 coins, then rise one per round so that earlier messages are easier to send<br/>
* players flipping coins to see if a message is garbled can choose to put some of the coins into the tyrantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suspicion pool rather than flipping them. This should be the main way that he leaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suspicion grows, although probably still add suspicion automatically from face to face meetings and in later rounds.<br/>
* only allow 1 on 1 meeting because if the whole conspiracy can meet together to talk why bother to send messages.<br/>
* always randomly determine which method of garbling will apply to messages (so that players canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t write messages in a way that easily bypasses the garbling)<br/>
* maybe add another garbling method (like oulipoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s N + 7)<br/>
* each round player send messages plus their character takes one preparatory action (buying explosives, recruiting an ally, etc.). You have to flip coins to succeed at the action. Flip a number of coins equal to whichever one of your 3 traits is most relevant and if you get at least one head, you succeed. Maybe your profession can give a bonus coin if relevant.<br/>
* during resolution of assassination attempt, have each player narrate one action per coin flip, rotating around table <br/>
* If conspiracy fails in first attempt give them bonus coins for later attempts (reflecting experience) to balance out tyrantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s increased starting suspicion.<br/>
* Use an Ã¢â‚¬Ëœout of townÃ¢â‚¬Â GM. After plans are devised, call a friend living out of state and pass the phone around so each player describes their part of the plan and the person on the line then decides if the different parts of the plan are mutually supporting, and awards coins accordingly. <br/>
* For GM-less play, each player starts with 2-3 coins. After communication phase, players write out or state their actions and for each Ã¢â‚¬ËœlinkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ between different playersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ statements, give the other player a coin. For example Josh placing allied driver in tyrantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s car would link to JudsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flagging down car.                </div>
