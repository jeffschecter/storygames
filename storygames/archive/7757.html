(To be honest, this was the basis of a half-remembered dream from the previous morning.)  For lack of a better name, call the game "Gridlock".<br/><br/>I don't know about others, but I often do crosswords while travelling.  And while it's been a long time since I've bought one in a convience store at a gas station, it seems like I remember puzzle books being fairly easy to pick up on a whim.<br/><br/>The basic idea is similar to Dread in that you only face a challenge when success is in question.  A challenge comes in the form of the storyteller ("Navigator"?) asking you to fill a word in the grid that fits legally - I will have to look the specifics up.  Mechanically, I would suggest that words should be alternated between being placed across and down. The word should be related to the challenge (ignore any clues associated with the puzzle grid).<br/><br/>This is really a "little idea" because it is not fully formed, but some things I like about it:<br/>* The words added in response to a challenge can drive the story.  This helpful for a "Navigator" who is quite possibly occupied with the task of actually driving and therefore can't access reference materials.<br/>* The Navigator can ask for longer words for tougher challenges.<br/>* The longer the game goes on, the harder it will be to fill in words.<br/>* You have an artifact of play at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Initial challenges could be used to set up the grid.  Have each player provide a word or phrase that describes what they want out of the game and that must be placed in the grid - again - legally.<br/><br/>My only struggle is that requires the players to potentially have the same level of literacy.  In my case, my most likely "game session" would include my wife (a Communications Director), my son (who is reading beyond the second grade level), and potentially my daughter (who is three - "and a half!").  Now this may suggest a collaborative approach to challenges, which may in itself be a fine thing.  <br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
