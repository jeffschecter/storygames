                    Here's something I'm considering doing.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine if a game was written as a series of free downloads; a couple stand-alone 'introductions', and then a few build-up 'supplements' - here's a demo; if you want to add character advancement, grab that continuation.  If you want character creation, get that one, and for situation builders, go over there. <br/>
<br/>
Not to say there wouldn't ever be a complete book.  But that you could play with all this stuff, buzz could be built, playtesting done, and so on, as it came along.  <br/>
<br/>
It's what I'm already doing in a few ways for my game; I'm thinking of taking it up a notch, and making that my actual strategy.<br/>
<br/>
How does that strike you?                </div>

                            I forsee one major possible problem - if any of the pieces are not standalone. Suppose I download the part about character generation, and in it I find references to the conflict resolution rules (not unlikely, if traits have anything to do with it). Can I download the part about conflict resolution? How difficult is the cross referencing?<br/>
<br/>
Most "chapters" of RPG systems don't stand by themselves. I often find myself paging forward and back trying to fully understand a concept, or just give up on understanding everything as I go, hoping that it would all make sense in the end.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, if this is too difficult, I give up.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as additions to the game, things that aren't mandatory but would make it better/longer-lasting/cooler, this could be an excellent idea. Character Advancement is one possible example of this.                        </div>

                            I think it is a great idea and worth trying.  I'm not sure it's going to generate buzz in and of itself, though.  People who like your work will be all over it and pick up whatever you offer, and so will converts - it is all interrelated, and it is all free, so what's the barrier?<br/><br/>I disagree that they each need to stand alone, but if they don't you are just releasing your book chapter by chapter.                        </div>

Well, right now, the idea is to have two stand-alone intoductions.  One is basic rules for a whole group, a situation, and actual play.  That one is in final editing - it's my playtest kit.  It's *very* much for running through as a group.  Premade characters.<br/>
<br/>
The other stand-alone introduction would be a single-player reader, along with a character generator, and a one-player mini-game that stands independently.<br/>
<br/>
Then, there would be up to three "expansions".  Each would require one or the other of the two introductions, and they'd state that, and tell you where to get them, right up front.                        </div>

                            Since you're talking about free downloads, it doesn't seem to be too much of a problem. Spreading a commercial game over multiple modules might alienate potential buyers, however.<br/><br/>From your examples, I wonder what pieces constitute "the game" as such and what can be deemed an add-on. As for the add-ons, would they be tailored to your particular game or be more universal in application (e.g., situation builders for Dogs or a generic approach to building situations for any game). How you answer that makes a big difference on how they might be received.                        </div>

                            I just thought of another advantage to the split model - lower initial buy-in. If all I need in order to "use" this game is a 20 page file, I'm much more likely to read it then a comparative 70 page file. That is assuming that all other things being equal - both games being free, no familiarity with either of the writers, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the way you describe it, I like the idea. I too don't think it'll generate buzz all on it's own, but it's probably not going to hurt, and the lower buy-in might give it an edge in the early stages (before reputation comes into play).                        </div>

<p>Lower buy-in, in reading terms, does sound nice.</p>
<p>Another idea for this that I'm not sure about is that in the one-player introduction, I <em>could</em> actually serve the whole "player making a character for fun" in ways that most games simply can't.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if that would be smart, though.</p>

                            Hey Levi, I think the idea is awesome, and heartily encourage you to go forward with it.  It'll be a fresh example of a new way of distributing your game.  And once you publish and sell, you can compile it all into a book, complete with extra goodies, scenarios, rules and explanation, and the people who followed you along the way will totally go for that as well.<br/><br/>Very cool stuff.                        </div>

I have two sides of my personality talking to me on this.  The first is my cynical side.  It says, "Sounds like a coward's way out of avoiding the hard work of completing an entire game and taking the lumps that come with it."  And the optimistic side saying, "What a rad idea!  Why hasn't this been done before?  I'm in!"  So I don't know.  I tend to go with my optimistic side more often than not ;-)<br/>

<p><strong>Andy:</strong>  Well, the idea is to keep it free until there's a whole book.  Which means the book will come out to a fully-prepped audience (there's both good and bad, there), I'll have the stuff I got there with as promotional material, and the audience can be pleased to know that they're only spending actual money once, and they're spending it on something heavily tested.  There's a lot of ups and down there, but I think I'm going to go for this.</p>
<p><strong>Troy:</strong>  That sounds an awful lot like the argument I've been having with myself about whether or not to do this.  So far as I can tell, the cure is to get a bit more ambitious with each of the little modules than I was thinking of at first.</p>

                            My only hesitation involves the fact that lots of these modules will have cross-dependencies, and if you are writing some of them after others have been published, you are setting yourself up to have some insoluable conflicts -- unless you can, say, update the initial starter kit download when the situation builder module needs it to have a new section for something it's introducing.<br/>
<br/>
Or you could write the entire thing and then release them one by one, but at that point, there's little benefit.                        </div>

                            Echoing Joshua's concern:  Please, please, please do a thorough job cross-referencing. It's the biggest weakness of Burning Wheel. There are times when reading both the Core Book and the Character Burner where I'd be confronted with a term I needed to know and there would be no indication if it was in the book I was reading or the other one. Don't make your reader jump blindly between books/files/volumes.                        </div>

<p>Joshua:</p>
<p>Well...   Here, let me show what they'd be if I keep on this tack, and you can tell me if that's true.  The game itself is called The Pulse.</p>
<p><em>Thirst</em> is the "Demo" introduction, for 3-5 players, and is one last edit from ready for trying in actual play.  It has pregenerated characters, and stands alone, or will when it's done.</p>
<p><em>Feral</em> will be the single player reader.  It'll duplicate a lot of the information from <em>Thirst</em> in a slightly different format, and will includes character creation rules as a stand-alone solitaire game; like lifepaths, but game-ish.</p>
<p><em>Brimstone</em> will require either or both of those, flat-out, and won't duplicate anything.  It's a whole mess of situation-creating stuff, rumors, "Spurs" (which are basically Bangs tuned to the game, not necessarily the characters), and 'stuff for the world you can throw in your game, or not'.  It's all about situation and color, nothing else.</p>
<p>Then there'd be probably about two more, if I went this way.  To make up names for them just from thin air...</p>
<p><em>Totems</em> would be about territory, set-pieces, hideouts, that line of stuff.  It would likely require either or both of the two introductions, but would not require <em>Brimstone</em>.</p>
<p><em>Clarity</em> would be all about the nature of people after the apocalypse of the game.  It's where character advancement would go, along with stuff about flashback and recall scenes, and it's where the optional "spooky powers" stuff, such as it is, would go as well.  It's need both introductions, but nothing else.</p>
<p>...At least, that's the idea right this second.</p>

                            Hi!<br/>
  I am generally turned off by this method of distribution. On screen it requires a lot of open windows. Although, if a gmaes good enough or they offer a single download that has all the current files, I can usually get over it, lol<br/>

                            Before I print them, I often read through 'em to make sure they're worth it. If it makes no sense on the screen or doesn't capture my interest it doesn't make it to the print-and-study-in-depth stage (this is where clear and pleasant layout also helps the most).<br/>
<br/>
This doesn't really seem to be that much of an issue in this case, though. Also, at the point where several files are available it doesn't sound difficult to also post a Full Game (or as much as you've got) file.                        </div>

                            First of all I'm curious how the situation-creation can apply to a single-player reader.  Not saying it can't, but I'm confused on how you could play that out.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, what if you wanted to create a situation (Brimstone) that involved the spooky powers (Clarity)?  Or to be more esoteric, how can the situation be scaled to apply to different power levels as produced by the character advancement?<br/>
<br/>
Mind, I'm not saying that this isn't a viable method -- it just has some wrinkles that need to be smoothed out, and they are best smoothed out, I find, by being conscious of them.                        </div>

<p><em>"Also, at the point where several files are available it doesn't sound difficult to also post a Full Game (or as much as you've got) file."</em></p>
<p>This may sound a bit funny.  But I'd only do it as a zip file, composed of the same bits.  Collating them all into "one book" would wait until the real book is done and polished.</p>

<p><em>"First of all I'm curious how the situation-creation can apply to a single-player reader. Not saying it can't, but I'm confused on how you could play that out."</em></p>
<p>Sorry, that may have been unclear - you'd need a group.  Each person could have built their own character and learned the basics with Feral, or the group could be continuing play, already knowing the rules, from Thirst, with the pre-mades, or some mixture.</p>
<p><em>"In any case, what if you wanted to create a situation (Brimstone) that involved the spooky powers (Clarity)? Or to be more esoteric, how can the situation be scaled to apply to different power levels as produced by the character advancement?"</em></p>
<p>That would basically in the hands of the group.  The methods of situation-building are comparatively "loose"; effectively, the situation-builder, if it works, should be kind of a loose web of stock characters, rumors, stories, encounters, and discussion on creating more of all those things, and quick ways to charge them with the kinds of tension that make the game run.</p>
