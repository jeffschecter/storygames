Tons of heavy books (I started with Shadowrun, so go figure... ^_^ ), often loads of dice, stuff to write on, maybe chips or other tokens... <br/>And that's without going into battlemaps, miniatures or snacks. <br/><br/>For a long time, this conflicted with my "No matter what happens, I'm prepared" style of packing my bags. (Prepared not in the survival sense, but in the "Whatever strikes my fancy" sense. I hate it when I want to listen to some music but don't have a CD player with me, or want to draw but find myself without a pen or sketchbook.) Dragging all stuff I need/want to game with me would break my back, on the other hand I've lost count how often I forgot to bring dice or whatever.<br/><br/>For a while, I satisfied the urge with just carrying around a few dice, mostly d6 (For Wushu or SR.) and a bunch of others, but they were somewhat bulky, the bag had the tendency to open, spreading my dice through my bag and it annoyed me that I couldn't really take any rules with me. (And this became worse when I saw the cool thread we had here about the ways other people here transport their stuff.)<br/><br/>BUT NOT ANY LONGER!!!<br/><br/>For now I'm working on my perfect gaming pack. It started when I found this Folder for cheap in a local store:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://silverpath.pbwiki.com/f/IMAGE004.PNG"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://silverpath.pbwiki.com/f/IMAGE002.PNG"/><br/>Out of the box, it just included a notepad (On which you can see my test character for the "Book of Nine Swords" d20 rules.) but I've already added a CD-R/W with my digital game collection (Lots of Indie games there, but also Tristat dX, d20 SRDs, ...),  the first trial printout of my <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=322546" rel="nofollow">personal Wushu Core</a> and a few pens. <br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://silverpath.pbwiki.com/f/IMAGE001.PNG"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://silverpath.pbwiki.com/f/IMAGE003.PNG"/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://silverpath.pbwiki.com/f/IMAGE005.PNG"/><br/><br/><b>Next Steps:</b><br/><br/>- The various file-holders will be labled, probably "Systems", "Characters" and "Various", or whatever...<br/>- One of my LGS has TINY six-sides dice, like 2-3 mm, which I'll buy a dozen or so of and put them into the bag next to the CDs, in case I forget my other dice when playing Wushu or SR.<br/>- I'm planning to print business card or something similar for my <a href="http://www-story-games.at" rel="nofollow">austrian SG forum</a>, so don't have to write the address down whenever I give it to people. <br/>- I THINK Engels Arcana cards could fit into the business card slots, but I haven't tried. Could be usefull, though.<br/><br/>But what other kind of stuff can I put into this nice thing? Any ideas? <br/><br/>Aaron                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66528/#Comment_66528" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-02T06:20:03+00:00" title="May  2, 2007  6:20AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My question would be, what other kind of stuff do you <i>need</i>?

(Like, M&amp;Ms for Chi and whenever you cash in a "chip", you get to eat it. Same for Nemesis Chi or Mook Threat-Rating.)<br/><br/>Otherwise, Wushu doesn't really need, well, anything. Which is a large part of why I love it. I could fit the rules on the side of a playing card, a bunch of six-siders can be stolen from various bordgames and that's it, you're ready to roll.<br/><br/>Even the printout of the Wushu rules is just unnecessary fancy, actually. I have memorized all the rules long ago, but I do like the idea of making a hefty Tome out of a small rules-light game. (And it would be cool to have all the Tempus guides, Roanoke, Erebus, Wushu Open Reloaded and so on in one book.) I even plan to make it hardcover. ^_^ \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sempiternity</cite><br/>That is a cool folder, though!

Maybe even some cheap PDA/eBook-Reader for on-the-move reading or electronic dice-rolling...<br/><br/>But I don't have the money for this stuff right now. (And it's not like I really need it.)

(I even have two.), but they are too small to hold my collection AND serve my everyday "Shift stuff from A to B" needs. (And too many of my friends PCs have their USB slots only on the back and I hate crawling under the desk everything I want to look at my files. ^_^)<br/><br/>But I've been meaning to buy a 1GB Stick for a while now (They are getting cheaper by the minute, after all.) and then I'll probably put all the gaming files on it too.<br/><br/>Graph paper I've never had much need for, most people have at least a few notepads lying around that can be used to sketch stuff when necessary.

That is the drawback with computers and even felt tip markers, you can write so much quicker, that you sometimes have your hand going quicker than your mind.\n<blockquote>I really wish I had my pens with me right now.
