Along those same lines, I'm wondering if anyone has done something similar using economics as a starting point.<br/><br/>Perhaps a better explanation of why I am asking will help... Any time a theory or person tries to tackle notions approaching "everyone plays for different reasons", "what do people get out of playing RPGs" and so on, what's really being talked about is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility" rel="nofollow">utility</a>. Talking <i>usefully</i> about utility is damned hard, but economists have been doing it since the 1800's. It seems to me, therefore, there might be a useful toolbox in economic theory (including an <a href="http://www.gametheory.net/popular/film.html" rel="nofollow">obsession with games</a>) for talking about game design.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, my training lies in routing electrons about, not economics. Anyone else want to take a stab at it? Or point me to someone who already has?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273446/#Comment_273446" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-28T10:30:45+00:00" title="May 28, 2010 10:30AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lester,<br/><br/>Economics is my natural "lens" to look at things. I think most non-economists think economics has to do with money. You're taking it a step in the right direction by examining utility. A step further in the right direction is David Friedman's definition of economics:<br/><br/>"Economics is that way of understanding behavior that starts from the assumption that people have objectives and tend to choose the correct way to achieve them."<br/><br/>And then a further refinement on top of that would come from all the latest research and theorizing about patterns of human irrationality and evopsych and cultural influences and other neat stuff.<br/><br/>So, yes, I think economics is particularly well-suited to understanding games and why people play them and how to shape artifacts that will be more useful to people.<br/>But then on the other hand I look at games like Farmville and I always think of Skinner's pigeons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273465/#Comment_273465" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-28T11:44:20+00:00" title="May 28, 2010 11:44AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, this thread title was like it was crafted to draw me in! I, too, like to use economics as a lens for, yeah, just about everything. Especially since I think that "resources" of various sorts are what games are all about (some more explicitly than others, but think real broad when I say resources, cos I am), economics is a mental tool I use when thinking about games all the time. I'm not a trained economist or anything like that, my learnings lie more in the "traditional" literary criticism/anthropology/psychology way of looking at games and the theory thereof. That article on "Ritual Discourse in RPGs" on the Forge hit all the right spots for me. <br/><br/>But to get back to economics, I'm not so sure about using it as a "why people play RPGs" platform, but it is definitely a useful design tool for mechanics and such like. Now, I could be off base here (see above about "not an economist") but I tend to see Economics proper not paying too much attention to people's motivation for utility, but rather how they go about achieving it. So, for example, if I find utility in pretending to be an elf because I think elves or neat, or because elves address meaningful topics to me, or whatever, I think economics could help us figure out what would best get me to be a neat elf or able to best address meaningful elf issues, but it kind of takes those desires on my part as a 'given', rather than providing a new lens for examining those desires. But I'd love to be proved wrong!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273467/#Comment_273467" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-28T11:47:52+00:00" title="May 28, 2010 11:47AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As you suggest, mathematical game theory (versus the <i>game design</i> theory we are usually talking about when we say "game theory") is economic in nature; it presumes outcomes or "payoffs" (measured in units of utility, naturally) associated with particular combinations of strategies chosen by players. But the thing about utility is that it's <i>exogenous</i> rather than <i>endogenous</i>. In other words, utility comes from <i>outside</i> the model rather than inside; there's no economic reason <i>per se</i> why a player might prefer one outcome to another. So the payoff structure in any given game must be taken as given, either as an assumption of the modeler or an empirical fact of the game. So looking to economics for an explanation of <i>why</i> people assign different values to particular outcomes strikes me as a tough row to hoe.<br/><br/>On the other hand, what game theory does give you is a much stronger sense of how to construct cycles of play that do what you want them to do. Tony Lower-Basch's <i>Capes</i> is a good example of this; I seem to recall him discussing the development of that game in game-theoretic terms at one point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273473/#Comment_273473" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-28T12:11:51+00:00" title="May 28, 2010 12:11PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Bill is right on about this. When formal game theorists talk about the maximization of utility, they're always talking about some other form of utility than that which arises from the playing of the game itself. The sad thing is, there's nothing inherent in the mathematics of Game Theory that would make it impossible to treat utility as both exogenous and and endogenous to any particular game. But who in economics departments has time to do this, while they're all so busy making minutely accurate predictions about the business cycle?

Mainstream American and Anglo economic theories (and not just these schools of thought) operate from the premise that scarcity is a fixed, unchanging fact of societies, even of life itself; operating from that basis, the field of economics focuses primarily on taking advantage of existing scarcity conditions rather than seeking to break through these barriers to make life better for humanity.<br/>In that sense, economics is very, very different from nearly every other scientific field. The medical profession, for example, seeks to change the conditions in which humans live their lives - - certainly not on its own, but with the collusion of waste management, education, and other sectors, both public and private. <br/><br/>I back up my distribution claim with the fact that economics is more properly known, at least historically, as "political economy" - the study of the manner in which political and commercial systems interact (forgive the glib definition). And personally, I think this is a fair assessment, on the basis that all transactions are exchanges between larger systems (families, businesses, neighborhoods, states, nations...), and that corporate, military, and governmental systems must have distribution systems to function, even on the smallest scale of operation.<br/><br/>Wordman, I'm really intrigued about the notion of using econ as a lens for analysis and design, but as-yet I don't see how one could go about it, short of simply teaching gamers *about* economics.
