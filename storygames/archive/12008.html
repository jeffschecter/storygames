I know that a few RPGs of such variety already exist; Mage, Ars Magica and Sorcerer. Perhaps there are others folks could tell me of?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any event, I've taken it upon myself to fiddle around with some ideas on my own approach to the idea. I draw inspiration from aforementioned games plus Magic the Gathering and Talislanta. While I like the idea of completely free form magic, I think a loose structure would go a long way to making the game mechanically/tactically interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay, so an Arcanist's Magic Style is composed of two broad categories; Methods and Realms.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Methods</b> represent training and natural ability with specific applications of magic. They are; Offensive, Defensive, Maneuver, Control and Summon.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">The <b>Offensive</b> Method is subdivided into three Forms; Hard, Soft and Area. The Hard Form represents solid attacks such as earthen spikes. The Soft Form represents spiritual, mental and similarly intangible attacks. The Area Form represents attacks that cannot be dodged or shielded against, instead one must rely on his Aura to overpower them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe <b>Defensive</b> Method is subdivided into three Forms; Shield, Barrier and Aura. The Shield Form protects against physical (Hard) attacks but is weak against Soft and Area attacks. Barrier protects against Soft attacks but is weak against Hard attacks. Aura protects against Area attacks but is weak against Hard attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe <b>Maneuver</b> Method is subdivided into three Forms; Flight, Surface and Liquid. The Flight Form allows flight (!) utilizing different approaches. Surface allows movement to be sped up in certain conditions, also allows one to meld with specific substances. Liquid allows movement to be sped up in liquid and also allows the user to augment his body with certain aspects based on the Realm used.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe <b>Summon</b> Method is subdivided into three Forms; Banish, Creature and Object. The Banish Form allows Arcanists to remove summoned creatures. The Creature Form allows Arcansists to summon living beings. The Object Form allows Arcanists to bring certain objects into existence for a limited amount of time, the more complex the littler the duration.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe <b>Control</b> Method is subdivided into four Forms; Enchantment, Shape, Transmutation and Unique. The Enchantment Form allows the Arcanist to imbue people, places and things with certain aspects. The Shape Form allows the Arcanist to control existing materials at will. The Transmutation Form allows the Arcanist to shift one material into another. The Unique Form confers special abilities based specifically on a Realm.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<b>Realms</b> represent the location from which the Arcanist is capable of drawing of power and the form of which his spells take on. They are; Air, Animals, Death, Earth, Fate, Fire, Hex, Illusions, Life, Mechanical, Mind, Plants, Shadow and Water.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, players create their Arcanist by allotting points across Attributes (not spoken of here), Methods and Realms. They then create Spells utilizing the following format; Realm -&gt; Method -&gt; Form -&gt; Spell Level -&gt; Aspects/Effects. Realm and Method rating impact Spell Level. Form and Spell Level impact Effect. All things considered impact Aspects. Aspects are one sentence descriptors of a Spell that can be used in narration. Sometimes they confer minor bonuses if the narration succeeds in pointing out a way the spell grants a special advantage in a specific situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I need help with here... is what Realms to include. I'm not sure about my list. For instance, I was thinking of making Illusions the 'Unique Form' of Mind. Also, I'm not sure about my Methods and Forms quite yet either. I only wrote this up today but I figure a fresh set of eyes will have a positive impact.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease help! Outside of my lil' questions here, I would most certainly enjoy feedback of any variety.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268756/#Comment_268756" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-24T06:11:05+00:00" title="April 24, 2010  6:11AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2010 6:13AM by Teataine.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this should go into the Praxis sister forum.<br><br>Otherwise it looks decent. For Realms I would most definitely go something more flavourful. "Illusions" just sounds kinda bland really. If this is for a generic game, then there's probably no way to go around that, but if you've got a setting and premise for this make magic that fits the world.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268763/#Comment_268763" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-24T07:19:07+00:00" title="April 24, 2010  7:19AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2010 7:20AM by MacLeod.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I never noticed the Praxis tab as the "Signed in as MacLeod (Sign Out)" text is obscuring it.

Or perhaps I should just forget this thread and create the same thing in Praxis?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as flavor/naming conventions are concerned... What would you recommend?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Methods, Forms and Realms are going to be words and ideas expressed by characters in the game's setting. Would it help to know that an Arcanist whom specializes in Mind/Illusion magic is called a Mesmer*?<br/>\n[align=right]<span style="font-family:'Geneva'">*As stolen from Guild Wars</span>[/align]<br/>\nThere will be many effects that even a lightly structured system such as this cannot achieve and that is okay with me because I think limitations will make the magic seem more 'real' in a few ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269077/#Comment_269077" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T23:15:02+00:00" title="April 26, 2010 11:15PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MacLeod</cite>I know that a few RPGs of such variety already exist; Mage, Ars Magica and Sorcerer.
