Vocal approval/disapproval ("Awesome!"/"Hmm.. I dunno.") or more subtle indications of the same are members effectively casting votes which influence events thereafter, whether or not anyone comprehends this.<br/>The latter is manifest democratic process with members of the group physically voting for or against a specific subject. This is a rarity in relaxed social conduct and express game rules both. Any reason?<br/><br/>Sorry if this is simply <i>wrong</i> in a <i>punch-the-screen-because-this-gorramed-art-student-doesn't-know-anything-about-political-science-or-sociology</i> kinda way. If you find this to be the case, I urge you to school me.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250174/#Comment_250174" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-09T13:31:10+00:00" title="January  9, 2010  1:31PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://vulpinoid.blogspot.com/2009/07/game-mechanism-of-week-29-democracy.html" rel="nofollow">My thoughts on this topic about six months ago.</a><br/><br/>I don't think they've changed much, since then.
