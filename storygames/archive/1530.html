                    Hey all, crossposting with RPGNet, but also wanted to throw it past you guys in case there's something particularly cool out there that I'm forgetting:<br/><br/>=====================<br/>Hey all, my regular gaming group just wrapped up our Time Travel game (using Primetime Adventures). Now we're looking to pick up an SF rules system for about a year for a multiple-GM (almost everyone in the group at some point or other will GM over the next year) experience.<br/><br/>* We're going to be gaming in a world which emulates the Vorkosigan Saga by Lois Bujold ( <a href="http://tinyurl.com/qkzo7" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/qkzo7</a> ). It basically lies right at the midpoint, from what I can gather, between Space Opera and Realism. No alien races (all humanity), but with some bio-engineering and weird cultures and stuff.<br/><br/>*We were going to go with a light or generic rules system like HeroQuest, but we wanted a game where there was "technical toys and goodies" (cyber arms, rocket-bikes, whatever) already in there in the rules. So Generic Rules Systems that Don't have specific tech toys in it won't work for us.<br/><br/>* We're aiming for "Rules Medium" at the most. If one of our characters die, or we change GMs, we want to have characters created and rolling in under an hour. We also don't want combat to be this bogged-down mess of modifiers.<br/><br/>* The background setting doesn't matter for the game, as long as it has tech toys, as we're gong to pretty much ignore it and roll our own way, anyway.<br/><br/>Some games we've looked at, and rejected:<br/>* STAR WARS d6: We're kinda sick of it (we played a lot of it already, and want something a teeny bit 'deeper' rulewise or whatever)<br/>* d20 Future: Two in the gaming group live levels in fantasy games, and hate them in SF.<br/>* GURPS: It's a little on the high end of rules heavy for us.<br/><br/>Games we're eyeing:<br/>* Blue Planet: Easy-medium, Solid, tons of tech goodies. The only thing we're wary of is that the combat is perhaps just a tad too gritty for what we're aiming for (might be that we could houserule it). Also, very hard to find the core books these days, and we want a game that everyone in the gaming group can purchase (or download if it's free).<br/>* I was kinda eyeing Savage Worlds, but noticed that it doesn't seem that there's an SF setting yet.<br/>* Shatterzone: But again, with the "hard to find".<br/>* The Colonies: <a href="http://www.pigames.net/store/product...products_id=40" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.pigames.net/store/product...products_id=40</a><br/>Looks good, more-or-less light, and has tech toys and stuff. Might be a little hard to break the system from the setting, as the character generation is pretty tied to specific planets with setting-specific conditions.<br/>* ICAR: <a href="http://www.icar.co.uk/index.xml" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.icar.co.uk/index.xml</a> I was a little wary at first (a friend recommended it on a simple web search), but I'm just loving that character sheet.<br/><br/>It's currently looking like a cook-off between Blue Planet and ICAR, but I wanted to gather more info from folks out there. What else would you recommend given the list of what we're looking for above, and why?                </div>

                            I have a softspot for Shatterzone.  I adore the Masterbook system.<br/><br/>Remember that recently (last two years) West End games released the d6 system with a d6 space core book.  it's pretty good.  So it's cleaned up Star Wars d6 without the Star Wars.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that <b>Burning Empires</b> will suit your needs but I think that is going to be a hard cell on all points.  Tech is not in a list but the way it's creation is handled is near genius in my book (if it's color then just describe it, if it has stats first it has to be in a scene as color and then it's built on the spot with a resource roll).  Build your worlds in minutes and use the human lifepaths.  For the most part you can even ignore the Infection rules if they don't suit you.<br/><br/>HeroQuest and The Shadow of Yesterday would do it except no laundry list.  To be honest I think all my fav sci-fi games don't have huge tech lists.  I really think HQ would rock as a sci-fi game!                        </div>

                            Yeah, I'm not too familiar with Traveller. I want something with a little kick. THe only things I know about it are:<br/><br/>1) In the oldest version, you could die in chargen (prob not accurate for a long time in newer versions).<br/><br/>2) A lot of people seemed to like the setting.<br/><br/>Since we're ditching the setting, I figured I'd aim for something snazzy.

                            To pitch my own game: <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/suffadv/" rel="nofollow">Sufficiently Advanced</a>, with some of the new mechanics stuff on the design journal and the info in the <a href="http://www.valentgames.com/download/SA_Alpha.zip" rel="nofollow">Alpha Version</a>, might work ok. No aliens, light on rules, and SA can certainly handle the technology. You might need to tone down the social tech, but statting up your own cultures and societies would be very fast. <br/><br/>Key points of the game:<br/>* Plot points let players control certain aspects of the game.<br/>* Core values tell what your characters care about, and protect them from social assaults.<br/>* Character creation balances attributes against plot points. You can get as much skill as you want, if you feel like being really old.<br/>* Flows from regular interaction into dice-based conflict and back with little to no intteruption of the game.<br/><br/>It might be a bit more in left field than you're looking for, but it fits the criteria. My older, more traditional sci-fi game (Valence) sounds more like the existing choices you have, but character creation is definitely more involved than you're looking for.                        </div>

                            Hey Andy,<br/>
<br/>
We just recently wrapped up an utterly awesome campaign of 2300AD (aka Traveller 2300). Check this out:<br/>
<br/>
http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?referrerid=&amp;t=268872<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, it was one of the best I've ever participated in. The system is 20 years old and it shows, but that said, it played pretty fast. The task resolution system it uses is quick, and combat has no real modifiers on the rolls so that goes fast too, once you get into it. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the setting is awesome and if you ignore the aliens (which is easy to do) you've got that mid-point between space opera and realism - 2300AD was maybe the only hard sci-fi rpg for a long time. The tech level gets criticized (nowadays), and so does the political situation, but it's all color, and can easily be updated on the fly to fit whatever you need it to, as we did in play. I'd compare it in some respects to Blue Planet, though it's not as dark in tone (despite the cyberpunk additions later in the line). You can add cybertchnology into it, sorta retconning on the fly for bio-tech, although it does have this in the form of alien-engineered biotech (which is totally freakin' weird and totally cool).<br/>
<br/>
It's got a lot of background but there's a large amount of space you can play in I've found, as a lot of it was never officially developed, so there are a surprising number of very active (and very cool) fan-sites that have material for these "uncharted areas" so to speak. <br/>
<br/>
It can accomodate a lot of different themes too - military, exploration, espionage, cyberpunk, and you can season it to taste (a Western-ish story like Firefly/Serenity would fit right in, as would some serious Masamune Shiro Ghost in the Shell /Appleseed action).<br/>
<br/>
Cam calls it "blue collar sci-fi" and I think he's on the mark there. It's gritty and hardcore, but not hopeless. It's like Arthur Clarke, Aasimov, Ben Bova, David Drake, Ridley Scott, and James Cameron all got together to make an RPG setting. Run with some new school techniques, I think this old school game can really deliver!                        </div>

                            Mmmm, Vorkosigan.<br/><br/>The stories range from extremely touching, even heartwrenching, to laugh-out-loud hilarious. For me, anyway - YMMV. Actually, they're often funniest when something really, really terrible is happening to the main character. Bujold said in an interview somewhere that she develops her plots by thinking of the worst thing she could possibly do to her character, and then doing it.<br/><br/>I think to capture the tone of the books you would need something where characters have deep vulnerabilities around a very solid core of firmly held values - so (by the sound of it) Sufficiently Advanced might be a fit.                        </div>

                            I've only read the first of the Vorkosigan books, but it was rather good. I know you've said no to GURPS, but isn't there a GURPS Vorkosigan already out there?                        </div>

                            Apparently the GURPS Vorkosigan is perpetually "just about to be released", like GURPS India.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            GURPS or a similar point-based system is clearly the system for the Vorkosigan books.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at the first Miles book, you can actually see the point optimizations in the character designs. (Miles and Bothari especially.)                        </div>
