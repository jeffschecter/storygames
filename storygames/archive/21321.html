Like <b>Purgatory House</b>, a quite cool Horror rpg, which sports an interesting Blackjack based system. <b>Generations</b> does intrigue me by offering a concept about characters once removed from life being reborn.  <b>Survive Et Al</b> is quite exciting, though maybe a tad boardgamey. Next to those games gamers who like Fate might fancy into the rocking mice of <b>Heavy Metal Thunder Mouse</b> or dive into the GoT inspired fantasy world of <b>Sustina</b>. There\u2019s as well a new Edition of <b>Outbreak: Undead</b>.<br/>Next to those I would like to point you to the <b>Rider of the Black Sun</b> game book by Mantikore, a book I heard is very well received, as well as the <b>Chill Undead Sourcebook</b>.<br/>There are plenty of foreign language games as well. Like, you\u2019ll find quite some projects from Germany. Like the translation of <b>Starfinder</b>, which does quite entice me. Next to this there are two full games. At the one hand <b>Fallen World</b> with a system of its own, at the other hand <b>Seelenf\xe4nger: T\xe4uscherland</b> which is based on Fate Core. Yet, the most interesting project for someone who does not speak German, is likely <b>TSUKUYUMI</b>. Not a tabletop RPG, yet an interesting game.<br/>You\u2019ll find many more projects in the list, I\u2019ll invite you to check out:<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>3 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 LARP Projects<br/>2 Various RPG Projects<br/>1 Other Game<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>3 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Fate Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Story Game Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Game Books<br/>4 Settings<br/>4 Supplements<br/>3 Supplements D&amp;D / OSR<br/>2 Supplements Science Fiction<br/>2 Supplements Part 2<br/>3 Adventures<br/>6 Dice Projects<br/>5 Accessories &amp; Containers<br/>2 RPG Calendars<br/>2 Live / Real RPG Play Projects<br/>4 Various RPG Projects<br/>2 Various Games with RPG Influences<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Supplement<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Supplement<br/>1 RPG Novel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466934/#Comment_466934" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-11T00:41:37+00:00" title="October 11, 2017 12:41AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These compendiums you share are amazing.

In general they are less like fixed categories that I'll have every crowdfunding. I'll do them to sort the mass of new role-playing games into more sizeable, digestible chunks. Thus I usually do them if I got more than one game for a category. I'd need like two gm-less games. Well or one that I do personally like veeery much ^^;                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teylen" title="Teylen"><img alt="Teylen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teylen">Teylen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467110/#Comment_467110" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-19T16:36:34+00:00" title="October 19, 2017  4:36PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I present to you the new <b><a href="https://teylen.wordpress.com/2017/10/19/crowdfunding-collection-55/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection No. 55, including every tabletop project started between 10.09 till 10.19.).</a></b><br/><br/>You\u2019ll find a few foreign language projects. The Sprawl is translated to German as <b>Der Sprawl</b>. <b>Tales of the Loop</b> will be translated to French and The Dark Eye will get a Dutch translation as <b>Het Oog des Meesters</b>. If you are curious about The Dark Eye and LARP, a crowdfunding for the (German) <b>LARP rules for The Dark Eye</b> is on its way.<br/>Though, as to get to the meat. I got enamored by <b>CATaclysm</b>. A game in which you play anthropomorphic cats, with a setting that does invoke memories of Nausica\xe4 \u2026 that\u2019s at least for me. Yet I do feel tempted by Jim Pintos <b>Praxis: Black Monk</b> game as well. I\u2019ve read one of the Praxis games and it\u2019s a really interesting concept.<br/>Then it\u2019s October again and Halloween is encroaching. Thus there are several games placed in the horror genre: <b>Don\u2019t Look Back</b> (Urban Horror), <b>Aliens &amp; Astroids</b> (SF Horror) and <b>B-Horror</b> (well d\u2019uh). Next to those, <b>The Road to Bethlehem</b> is a tabletop rpg / boardgame that caught my interest. It is the first game focused on religion, Christianity to be specific, to actually look competent and fun.<br/>There are of course more games. Like the <b>D20 / D30 RPG &amp; DCC Dice Chain Sets</b> set, which convinced me by presenting beautiful and strange dice. I am as well still considering getting the <b>Wee Beasties</b> kids book, as it looks really, really cute.<br/>Though there are plenty more cool projects, just take a look:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Fantasy Role-Playing Games<br/>3 Horror Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Story Games (GM-less)<br/>3 RPG-like games<br/>1 Supplement<br/>2 Settings<br/>2 Savage Worlds Settings<br/>4 Adventures<br/>4 Dice &amp; Coins<br/>3 RPG Accessories &amp; Aides<br/>2 Containers<br/>2 RPG Novels<br/>2 RPG Series<br/>4 Various RPG Projects<br/>5 Terrains &amp; Miniatures<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/>1 LARP Corebook<br/>1 Container<br/><br/><b>Dutch Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/>Link: <b><a href="https://teylen.wordpress.com/2017/10/19/crowdfunding-collection-55/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.wordpress.com/2017/10/19/crowdfunding-collection-55/</a></b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
