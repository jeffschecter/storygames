Have you used this in play, or is it just brainstorming/design so far?<br/><br/>You've simplified the harm move (to two options), which I like in some ways and dislike in other ways. (Mostly, the bad is that I suspect the choice will be too obvious in many situations: it won't be all that much of a choice in a lot of typical scenarios, and that could make the move less interesting.)<br/><br/>One thing your version does not allow is for a chance of death (or, alternatively, it leaves it entirely up to the MC). This could be a bug or a feature, but some more thought about how that works could be helpful. If someone shoots an arrow into my back, how do we decide whether it's deadly or not? Things could get a bit weird if I knew, for example, that the MC wouldn't kill my character on a miss, but *might* if I roll a partial hit and choose to continue fighting.<br/><br/>I've never got much use out of tags, but if they work for you, that's great. How do you use them in play? (My issue is that tags are purely narrative color, which seems unnecessary to me if I already have narrative color to begin with. If I narrate someone using a huge, heavy mace, what does it add to the game to say that it has the tag "unwieldy" or "messy", for example?)<br/><br/>The 'cross blades' move is VERY interesting! That's some new technology I haven't seen before, and it's got some very fascinating potential applications to *World moves. I'll definitely be thinking about that again! Once more, have you played with it already, or not? (I'd be tempted to add in a "secure an advantage, take +1forward" into there, so you can position yourself for a killing strike before you actually do it.)<br/><br/>Finally, I think this version of the descriptive harm could really benefit from a "fallout"-style move. Something you roll at the end, when the smoke clears, to see just how bad the damage is. That could be a good place to handle odds of death, if it's a feature of your system.<br/><br/>(And that's a solid observation about how the more unclear you make injuries/damage and the more you describe them, the more "scary" it seems, and the more "screen time" it will take up. An important consideration when making any kind of injury/harm system!)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451058/#Comment_451058" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-02T00:50:54+00:00" title="February  2, 2016 12:50AM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2016 12:52AM by Dirk.">edited February 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the thoughts, they're good ones.<br/><br/>I think that <a href="/forums/profile/Hybridartifacts">@Hybridartifacts</a> points about descriptive perspective would pair strongly with a Dogs style Fallout move. You know how things feel right away, but you have to wait till the end of a thing to actually know how bad they are.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that serves my goals here perfectly, but I'm definitely mulling over ways to incorporate something along those lines. Would love to hear proposals for how to set that up.\n<blockquote>I've never got much use out of tags, but if they work for you, that's great. How do you use them in play?

With the way defenses work, a weapon's tags mean a great deal. For example,<br/><br/>A master fencer might have the defenses: Quick evasion [  ] [  ] [  ], Armored [  ] [  ]<br/>If you...<br/>...strike at them with a hammer <i>(forceful, stunning</i>), they can avoid the attack by marking off a box of "quick evasion"<br/>...slash them with a longsword (<i>vicious</i>), they can avoid the attack, but they must mark off two boxes of an applicable defense, (because of the vicious tag.)<br/>...stab them with a rapier (<i>quick, piercing</i>), they can do nothing to avoid the attack, because it's tags make the defenses inapplicable. The quick tag counter's their quick evasion and the piercing tag punches right through the armor. So the attack stands, and the fencer takes a stab wound, the severity determined by the intent stated when triggering "cross blades."\n<blockquote>One thing your version does not allow is for a chance of death (or, alternatively, it leaves it entirely up to the MC).

The way it's handled here is by appropriately tagging monster moves. If something could kill you, it has the <i>mortal</i> tag. Could maybe expand that to a couple more tags for wounds you might take, like <i>minor, major, deadly</i> or something? I don't want to bog it down with many more rules, will have to try it out to see what feels cumbersome.<br/><br/>I've only done testing of single scenes trying out individual features, so it's hard to get a sense of how they stand up.

As you check them off, things go badly for you. "I'm nimble/I never tire/I'm alert". Each time you take a wound you cross one off. "Vicious" weapons take off two. That kind of thing.<br/><br/>I'm not into this whole "tag" approach; I find it overly mechanical. But that would fit what you've going on so far, it seems to me.

Whether the GM deals damage using numbers or description, the GM has to follow their principals to decide how deadly something is. A GM can make HP totally meaningless if they're not following their principles in deciding the numbers. A GM following their principles can't just kill you capriciously. We're relying on those principals in the same way as with HP.<br/><br/>I think the key for managing this descriptively is solid communication about the risks and potential outcomes of injury. If death is on the table, the player needs to know that when making their decisions. A revision of the Endure duress move with that in mind:\n<blockquote>When you face immediate and unavoidable injury or distress, <b>ask the GM exactly how serious it is,</b> and roll. On a 10+, both; on a 7-9, choose one:<br/>It doesn\u2019t hamper you, you can ignore it for now<br/>you\u2019ll find out later that things are less dire than it \tseems; you will recover without complication<br/><br/>On a 6 or less, you suffer the calamity in full. If it\u2019s a lasting thing, make note of it below:<br/><br/></blockquote>\nSo now between "ask the GM exactly how serious it is" and rolling is where we spend our HP/Armor points. And we know exactly what choice we're making on a 7-9.<br/><br/>As far as the NPC stuff goes, I think I'm content to can the symmetry and settle for something move abstract on that end. Maybe using a few fixed levels of damage with  fixed levels of harm that you check off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451194/#Comment_451194" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-08T16:24:38+00:00" title="February  8, 2016  4:24PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder if you saw my more recent Apocalypse World harm moves, as well?

However, I used the "visceral harm" moves in an AW campaign I ran, where they worked just great.<br/><br/>They definitely DO slow things down and shine a big spotlight on the act of being injured. I liked it for what it was, but I wouldn't want to use that in a game where people are injured on a regular basis - this made a thing to avoid and a thing to fear, which was what I wanted.<br/><br/>How did it go for you? Your experience sounds positive so far, so I wonder what your concerns are.<br/><br/>Looking at your playbooks: that's a really nice hack! There's some great stuff in there, and I really like the Bolster move. (Was it called Rally before?) Excellent stuff, I'll be thinking about it for a while.<br/><br/>When it comes to NPCs getting hurt, I'm a little confused about what you're asking. The "visceral harm" rules I wrote for AW worked with AW, where weapons have harm ratings, so that was fine. The "descriptive harm" was intended to work with DW or WoD, where PCs roll dice for damage.<br/><br/>What are you using in your hack, then? I can't tell from the playbooks. Is it the "defenses" from earlier in this thread?<br/><br/>I'd imagine that your various options you have built into the playbooks should create quite a difference between the various character types (in particular, having a bonus to cross blades is probably the biggest factor in how able you are to harm your enemies, since it allows you to choose more "attack tags" on a good roll). However, in general your hack seems like it puts the PCs very much on even footing mechanically, distinguishing them rather by the *different* things they can each do and attempt.<br/><br/>Also, I find your "cross blades" move quite interesting.

I was waffling back in the direction of using numerical harm for NPCs, but now I'm onto something totally different again.<br/><br/>RE: cross blades, the previous version with "...if you're dealing major harm, -1," etc., I couldn't figure out how to address the idea of compounding injuries on NPCs.

It's like a better, but much more limited version of parley.<br/><br/>You don't need any leverage here, but the trigger is trying to be more restrictive. <br/>It requires that you "offer honest wisdom" and that your counsel must be delivered in the form of "what would best serve" the person you counsel.<br/><br/>It's useful when you know more than someone, or are dealing with someone stubborn or foolish.<br/><br/>An example from our play test:<br/><br/>The party is aboard a ship and has discovered a treasonous plot. The sage believes that the best course of action is to turn around and return to port, disrupting the traitors' plan.<br/><br/>The sage tells this to the captain. The captain is quite reluctant to abandon the voyage, not wishing to lose money. Now, wisdom dictates that it's more important to turn around and prevent this coup, but the captain's judgement is compromised by fear or greed.<br/><br/>The sage rolls to Offer counsel, gets a 7. So the captain reluctantly accepts the sage's wisdom, but will hold the sage responsible for anything that goes wrong. The sage asks me, "how might this counsel lead to ruin?"<br/><br/>I say, "this plan hinges on whether or not you can bring the treason to light and hold the traitors to task. If their plot succeeds, they'll definitely come after the captain." So now the sage knows what they have to do to make sure their counsel doesn't backfire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
