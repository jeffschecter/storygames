After considering a bunch of alternatives, we went for HeroQuest.<br/><br/>Of course, none of us have even read the rulebook yet. I'm as far as basic magic now; it looks quite manageable, but a little starting advice wouldn't hurt.<br/><br/>We're going to start with a group of not-very-powerful Heortlings. We have no specific focus or mission statement for the campaign, we're just going where it takes us. I'm not sure how much play we'll see in the first session - we'll probably spend a lot of time creating characters. I'd like to get in a few short contests and one extended contest, though.<br/><br/>Any tips on what we might want to focus on, rules-wise? Some do's and dont's for the start of the campaign? What are the tricky parts of HeroQuest, and what are the parts I don't have to pay attention to yet? There's a lot of stuff on different kinds of magic - do I have to read it all right now, or can some of it wait?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193544/#Comment_193544" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-22T07:09:32+00:00" title="February 22, 2009  7:09AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2009 7:29AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Matthijs,<br/><br/>I GM'd a game of HeroQuest at a convention.  We made up the characters at the table, and the game shot off like a rocket.  You can find a full thread of set-up <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=25796.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>Here's a bit from that thread, which I loved -- because my players (Chris, Scott and David, three guys I'd never met before) were great:\n<blockquote><cite>From: [Orccon][HeroQuest] In Glorantha, of all places! </cite>I start breaking out the rules.  It's going to be 100-word descriptions.  There are certain games, I think, that die if you give the Players pre-generated characters.  I need to know, as a GM, that the players are getting to play what they are invested or interested in playing one way or another.  And so, for me, letting them come up with the details is really important.  Yes, we lose a lot of time doing.  But, yes, I consider it part of play -- a fun part of play -- so this is how I do it.<br/><br/>And they're looking down at their blank character sheets, and I'm like, "And personalities can be a trait, and relationships can be a trait.... And it's all about family and connections and your tribe, blah, blah, blah, Glorantha."<br/><br/>And Chris, who had never played before says, "Okay. How about if we're all family. Like I'm the father and you two are sons." <br/><br/>I jump in fast but calm: "Guys if you like that idea, cool. But we're just bouncing ideas.  Anyone can suggest anything, but if it's about your character, just so no if you're not interested and we'll keep moving on till you get what you want."<br/><br/>But Scott and David like the ideas of being sons, so we go with that. <br/><br/>Then the Chris says, "Okay. My guy?  His wife died a few months ago. And I'm already courting another woman."<br/><br/>Scott jumps in with, "And my guy, he really doesn't like that." <br/><br/>And David says, "And the woman, she's secretly worshipping the Red Goddess." <br/><br/>And Chris goes, "Great!"<br/><br/>And Scott goes, "And I'm in the secret organization getting ready for the revolt against the Empire and dad and my brother don't know." <br/><br/>And Chris goes, "And the new girlfriend I'm involved with -- she's already pregnant."<br/><br/>And I'm like trembling with an unexpected RPG con game orgasm.  I mean, how the heck did that happen?  I know we can't lose.  My players are, in fact, doing all my work for me.<br/><br/>They're underlining words in their descriptions.  We're breaking out Key Words.  We're adding new words as they start grasping the flexibility of the system.<br/><br/>Scott has <i><b>Torkan</b></i>, the younger son, and writes down "Rabble-rouser 13."<br/><br/>Chris has <i><b>Alandres</b></i>, the father and writes down, "Ashamed of Son 13"<br/><br/>Scott writes down, "Hates Father 13"<br/><br/>David creates <i><b>Iskalli</b></i>, a skal and devotee of Orlanth's aspect of Destor. <br/><br/>Alandres is courting <i><b>Daleeta</b></i>, who is both carrying Alandres' child, but also is secretly worshipping the Red Goddess.<br/><br/>Chris describes Alandres as melancholy and broken since his wife's death.  He's in mourning and it's going on too long.  He gives Alandres a Mourning Wife 13.<br/><br/>It goes like this.  We're laughing, having fun.  A couple of times the players start narrating out what happens when they found out about Daleeta, or how they'll react, but I go, "Whoa, whoa, whoa... Save it for play!"</blockquote>\nSo, for me the thing to keep in mind when starting Glorantha is that while I had no grand adventure for that convention game (see the post for full details), there's so much Situation built into the Setting that all you need to do is focus on the Religious, Occupation and Culture keywords and the Players will be cooking for gas with you.<br/><br/>Nor did I lay out all of Glorantha for the Players.  We focused on one village and I laid out some of the Big Conflict Issues that would be relevant to THAT tribe.  (Mostly problems with the Lunars.)  (Here's an essay called <a href="http://glorantha.com/support/overwhelming.html" rel="nofollow">Glorantha Will Be Overwhelming... If You Try to Do it All at Once</a> on dealing with Glorantha as as staring setting.  Stafford liked enough to put up on the <a href="glorantha.com" rel="nofollow">glorantha.com</a> website.)<br/><br/>So, when you say you want to start small and go slow, I say, "YES!"  But don't put the breaks on your players.  The convention game I played could have been the start of nine months of gaming -- and then it could have gone from there to the next big story.<br/><br/>If you have it, or can track it down, I would really recommend grabbing a copy of <i>Thunder Rebels</i>.  It's got lots of juicy color for the Players to grab onto, anchoring the setting with lots of thematic color and potential conflict even within a village.  (That's how my convention game went off.)<br/><br/>As for the Magic, I'm for keeping it simple at first.  A lot of it is tied to culture and stuff.  Use it, but assume that you and the Players will grow into it as you deepen YOUR understanding of YOUR Glorantha.<br/><br/><br/>It's really a fucking awesome game, and it's really a fucking awesome setting, and the setting and the game just dovetail so well together.  <br/><br/>Oh, and I should add: Despite the cool inter-family conflicts, there was no-face stabbing, no brutality, no abuse between players, no social violence, no cruelty between players, no emo, no tears at the table.  Just great roleplaying, storytelling and a really cool climax.  (I've written the last post for that Forge thread three times now -- and have lost it on several computer crashes.  I'm hesitant to try again... but now I'm inspired to finally write and post it fast.)  But seriously, my Players went to town with a story full of story stuff. <i> Grown-ups can handle story stuff</i>.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193546/#Comment_193546" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-22T07:24:43+00:00" title="February 22, 2009  7:24AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool!

What seems like the no-brainer loyalty in one moment might turn out to be the enemy the next, and the guy who clearly is your enemy in one case might, against an even worse threat, be a good ally.  Or you might stick to your guns and say, "We don't take help from those guys -- even if it means we're going to die."<br/><br/>It all depends on how you're setting up the game.

Have the players tie their characters into one or more characters and the campaign makes itself.<br/><br/>What's also nice, is that it creates potential allies within opposing groups and sets up the situations that Christopher is talking about.<br/><br/>Edited to add: make sure the players tie their characters into the web- by way of alliance, duty, or conflict with, and let the game write itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193619/#Comment_193619" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-22T23:54:35+00:00" title="February 22, 2009 11:54PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Chris.

You can always scan across the map, and find a new character to bring into a situation, because they're opposed to someone else.  ("...but suddenly, your ex-lover steps in front, shielding him from your finishing blow- 'He's not a good man, but I won't let you kill my brother!' - 'What?!?'") etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber" title="epweissengruber"><img alt="epweissengruber" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/epweissengruber">epweissengruber</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260611/#Comment_260611" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-07T20:32:44+00:00" title="March  7, 2010  8:32PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like Bankuei indicated, conflict webs etc. can provide a nice basis on which to run a game of HQ.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found that the 32 question questionnaire in the new Sartar book produces promising results.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what resulted from a 1 hour run through of the questions over beer and a 90 minute redaction at home by myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=503226                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
