Please don't take this as me dumping on your thread because I thought the video was funny, but I do take a few lessons from it.<br/><br/>The parody highlights the incongruity between task resolution in a narrative-oriented game. Or, basically, modern D&amp;D. The use of task resolution in this scene involves eight rolls, several of which were redundant, and it simultaneously made demands on the fiction while failing to address it.<br/><br/>"What is your character doing?" the DM asks, but then demands rolls for things the Arya's player doesn't say she does. She enters Littlefinger's room but never describes how and where she's searching, and instead the DM merely calls for an Investigation check to summarize her efforts (and then the obligatory Wisdom check to get the plot back on track).<br/><br/>In the OSR approach, Arya's player would go into detail about where she's searching in the room, opening cupboards and closets, and she would most likely be rewarded with an automatic success when she thinks of the mattress.<br/><br/>In a more narrative approach, Arya's player would describe her goals (to discover what Littlefinger is scheming) and the conflict would be resolved with appropriate consequences (that Littlefinger discovers she was rooting around his room).<br/><br/>Modern D&amp;D straddles the fence between the two, pushing for task resolution in a manner that resolves conflicts. The results are a mixed bag. If Arya's player had said "I search the mattress," how would the DM have reacted?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469728/#Comment_469728" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-07T15:57:42+00:00" title="February  7, 2018  3:57PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2018 4:08PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I am going to critique this video like a grumpy old man....</p></div></blockquote>\nHaha <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/><br/>Do you think the video is a good example of what a GM and PC would do in play?

He gave the player agency to pursue her goals and let her drive the story.

Can I find out any more?"<br/><br/>GM: "Ok, roll [ability]." <br/><br/><i>Player rolls.</i><br/><br/>GM: "Ok, now I will describe what your character does and the outcomes, often including how smart or creative or intimidating your character is."

You search the mattress and there it is!")<br/><br/><i>Players all cheer.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
