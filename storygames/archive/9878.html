They wound up making the Blaze siblings, a bold young brother and sister team in the Danger Patrol:<br/><br/>Peggy Blaze - psychic commando (Ping)<br/><br/>Billy Blaze - two-fisted daredevil (Jem)<br/><br/>My secret agenda from the start was that I wanted to have a big interplanetary invasion, native Neptunians fighting for her freedom, but I didn't want to be too rigid in my expectations since stuff the players introduce could seriously change all that. I also wanted to experiment a little with scale and type of action scenes, so we wound up with conflict that started off as a big debate to win over the rebels, plus the big interstellar war at the end.<br/><br/><b>In Media Res</b><br/><br/>We find our heroes lost in the blizzards of Neptune, slogging through waist-deep snow and blinded by flurries after their ship mysteriously lost power and forced them to land. <br/><br/>For a moment the wind stops and they can see down into the valley below... what they thought was a settlement or outpost turns out out to be a squadron of unidentified spaceships are disgorging troops and war-machines. They've stumbled on a secret invasion force!<br/><br/>(we later find out the ship's power was cut by null beams from the invaders hidden base on the Triton moon -- the invaders wanted to eliminate those pesky snooping Danger Patrollers before they spill the beans!)<br/><br/>Fixated on the invasion force, our young heroes don't notice the giant six-legged snow cats creeping up on them from the shadows, the cyber-controlled watchdogs of the invaders, until they're about to pounce!<br/><br/><b>Previously On...</b><br/><br/>Ping narrates Peggy handcuffed to an agent of the Crimson Republic, the handsome but dangerous Mikhail. They both got captured sneaking into the same [to be determined] complex, and now they have to temporarily join forces if they want to get out alive. Peggy loses her heart to the enemy, sealed with a kiss, but she can't let her brother know!<br/><br/>Jem puts Billy in the caverns beneath the jungles of Venus, on a raid to destroy the Death Ray before it can be fired. The team includes the renowned Dr. Z, long family friend and mentor to young Billy, until a cave-in buries him under tons of rock. We can't go, Dr. Z needs me! It's too late for him Billy... the team must press on, the Death Ray must be stopped.<br/><br/>I'm writing snippets and putting little checkboxes next to them so I can verify I've used them later on. So I've got:<br/>- Mikhail, beloved enemy spy<br/>- "the plans" (Ping said Mikhail was trying to steal them, but we don't know what they were or why he wanted them)<br/>- Dr Z. lost in cave-in<br/>- Death Ray on Venus<br/><br/>Now I just have to figure out how any of that fits into the icy blizzards of Neptune. <br/><br/><b>Action Scene <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> - Snow Cats</b><br/><br/>I start off simple to give them a chance to learn the system: three 3-snow cat threats. There's some daring as pouncing snow cats are dodged and flipped into ravines, and a raygun melts the ledge beneath a cat but also spawns a 3-avalanche.<br/><br/>They trounce the cats and are sneaking away, either to get a closer look at the invaders or find someone to warn, we're not sure, and I narrate a quick bit about how heavily bundled figures get the drop on them and take them prisoner. Our Heroes are marched off through the snow, coming to a hidden settlement built into the walls of a glacier rift. Their captors are native 'seidonians (aka Neptunians, Neptune -&gt; Poseidon), heavy-set blue skinned figures who eye them with considerable distrust.<br/><br/>What the heck is going on?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220535/#Comment_220535" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-24T04:03:10+00:00" title="July 24, 2009  4:03AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 24, 2009 4:55AM by Ben_Robbins.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>continued...</i><br/><br/><b>Interlude - Prisoners of Neptune</b><br/><br/>Cooling their heels under moderate guard in the hidden glacier rift city, we Interlude.<br/><br/>In the fight Peggy ripped out one of the sensor/control implants from the snow cats and now she uses her psychic powers to read its past, narrating that it was made by the Crimson Republic (dum dum dum!). They must be involved in the invasion. [and I add a checkbox]<br/><br/>Billy befriends one of their more curious guards and Jem has him reveal that this place is normally not inhabited. [and I add another checkbox]<br/><br/><b>Action Scene <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> -- Take Me To Your Leaders</b><br/><br/>Peggy and Billy are brought before the leaders for questioning. We rapidly find out that their captors aren't with the invaders, they're the native 'seidonian freedom fighters, who've led their people to this normally abandoned installation [check!] to hide out. The invaders are the hated Uranians, whose government is now merely a puppet satellite of the Crimson Republic [check!]<br/><br/>We establish that yes, this is a surprise, the Danger Patrol had no idea things in the Outer Planets were so bad. This becomes the recurring theme of the game: the idealists in the shining city on Mars might be out of touch. They assumed that because they stopped the Crimson Republic from crossing the Asteroid Belt in force, everything has settled into a nice manageable cold war, but while they're patting themselves on the back the Crimson Republic has been quietly spreading, away from the sun. They also blindly believed that all other sentients in the Solar System would see Mars as the shining beacon of freedom, and never voluntarily side with the tyrannical Republic. As it turns out, not everybody is so high-minded.<br/><br/>There is a mob of massive blue 'seidonians in the room, and they're clearly suspicious of the ex-Terrans -- after all, the other humans they've dealt with are the Republic "advisors" behind the Uranians. Conflict time!<br/><br/>I put down three threats for the debate:<br/>6-distrustful mob<br/>6-rash firebrand rebel leader<br/>3-fearful conservative rebel leader<br/><br/>Our heroes are going to have to win their trust if they want to join forces and oust the invaders... or just be crazy monkeys and break loose.<br/><br/>Just to be a total jerk, I also put down a fourth threat, 6-infiltrator saboteurs with a countdown. These infiltrators are somewhere else in the complex, sneaking around and causing trouble while this debate is going on. The players know but their characters don't, but they can metagame and narrate discovering the saboteurs if they attack them somehow. The math alone should make it clear that I'm not a nice person: two characters vs three major threats and a normal threat, plus the added cruelty that the heroes are using diplomacy, so they wind up using a lot of skills they happen to be terrible at.<br/><br/>Overall the rules worked quite well for debate combat. A little creativity required to not just keep hitting the same skills over and over ("you're arguing that you have families at home just like they do... hmm, sounds like cultural comparison, so Explorer!")<br/><br/>By the time the heroes have half won over / half busted loose to stop the saboteurs there are Uranian assault squads rushing into the complex (new spawned threats) and the Danger Patrolmen (and women) are caught in desperate firefights, micro-nukes, and booby-traps before they lead the brave 'seidonians to victory.<br/><br/>It's brutal. Billy Blaze maxes out his danger meter (and just about every box on it) and scores a new power. Peggy is close behind. They're battered and bruised, and we've still got one big fight to go... total interplanetary war.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220827/#Comment_220827" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-26T16:10:44+00:00" title="July 26, 2009  4:10PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I glossed over the talking part, but pretty much straight from the book we used:<br/><br/>Agent - deceive<br/>Detective - get at the truth, find out what people really mean<br/>Explorer - relate to strange people or cultures, finding common ground<br/>Professor - explain complicated ideas<br/>Warrior - intimidate<br/><br/>(ah, the priceless look on Jem's face when he tried to explain how their ship mysteriously lost power, and I called Professor, which he had a d4 in...)<br/><br/>But I'm guessing you could come up with talk modes for the remaining roles as well:<br/><br/>Daredevil - inspire or arouse with bold speeches<br/>Flyboy - out and out bragging, impressing with tall tales<br/>Commando - threaten                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220846/#Comment_220846" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-26T20:22:17+00:00" title="July 26, 2009  8:22PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that a lot, Ben... giving each Role a "talky" mode.

Wait, she's on Neptune now? She must leave, immediately! Why? Oh, well, y'see it was the plans for the Death Ray he was trying to steal (in "Previously On"). And he did steal them. And the Republic built one. And it's heading to Neptune, because their land invasion force recently had a big setback...

Woo hoo! Time for war.<br/><br/><br/><b>Action Scene <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> -- Let Slip the Dogs of Space War</b><br/><br/>The downtrodden 'seidonians know the only way to end the Uranian threat is to meet them in space and crush their fleet once and for all. Mikhail let slip that the Uranians have a hidden base on the moon Triton, the forward beach head of their attacks on Neptune. Taking it out will also break their chokehold on the planet, with the help of the Danger Patrol.<br/><br/>Ships launch, and battle is joined.<br/><br/>3-hidden base on Triton<br/>6-ambushed 'seidonian fleet (counter -- they blundered into a Uranian trap and will be annihilated unless someone comes to their rescue)<br/>3-Uranian war fleet (another one)<br/>... and last but not least<br/>9-Death Ray (counter -- when it gets into orbit around Neptune it's going to start eradicating cities)<br/><br/>The ships around the Death Ray carrier are actually Crimson Republic proper, not Uranian. The kid gloves are off. The Republic is taking Neptune one way or the other.<br/><br/>Each threat represents hundreds of enemy ships. It's assumed that wherever Our Heroes go, they're leading hundreds of 'seidonian ships of their own (or commandos, or boarding parties, whatever, depending on what they do). Mechanically it's exactly the same as one-on-one action. Time is also on a bigger scale -- a single round could be hours or days of war in space.<br/><br/>Jem and Ping embrace the shift in scale immediately. Peggy Blaze embraces her inner-commando and spearheads a crack squad of 'seidonians assault troops, stealth landing on Triton to sneak attack the base. Billy Blaze races to the rescue of the ambushed 'seidonian fleet with a squadron of warships.<br/><br/>We discover early on that Mikhail is on the Death Ray capitol ship advising the admiral. Is he warning his superiors about Peggy's interference, seeing through all her clever ploys because he knows her so well? Or is he keeping his mouth shut in the name of love?<br/><br/>Even worse, if Mikhail is on the Death Ray ship, Peggy can't blow it up! But how can she explain that to her brother?!?<br/><br/>Despite being physically separated, there's lots of good teamwork back and forth. After Peggy captures the base, she cracks their communication console and sends false signals to the enemy fleets, helping out Billy's whirling space battle. Peggy tries to hide that the base has fallen into enemy hands, so when the Crimson Republic admiral calls she pulls a "we're fine, we're all fine down here... how are you?" Han Solo move, which fails, so Crimson Commandos land and storm the base. The 'seidonians fight valiantly, but they're trapped with no hope of rescue... until Billy Blaze swoops down to the rescue with his victorious space fleet, strafing the commandos and breaking the siege on the base.<br/><br/>The combined 'seidonian forces confront the Death Ray fleet, racing to take it out before the counter expires and it starts pasting the cities of Neptune. Our Heroes launch a frontal assault but then stealthily board the ship in the middle of the fighting, but immediately get surrounded and captured. How did they know we were coming?!? Oh, Mikhail!<br/><br/>The Blaze sibs turn the tables on their captors and capture the bridge, but Mikhail is nowhere to be found (surprising even the CR admiral). Did he betray Peggy and scram before she could catch up with him? Or did he abandon his post rather than fight her? We'll have to tune in next time...<br/><br/>By the end of the third action scene, Peggy had spiked her Danger Meter and gotten a power too, but both of them were _covered_ in hits (literally everything short of the top two brackets).

I was definitely happy we managed to work in all six plot points they introduced (though Dr. Z was probably half credit this game).<br/><br/><i>Banking Power</i> -- The third action scene was actually easier than the second, because they were gaining power tokens very quickly at the top of the danger meter, and Billy (who spiked his meter in scene 2) had three or four tokens banked when the scene started. They had also learned the trick of not ignoring the threats -- if anything bigger than a 3 threat hadn't been hit, they'd buy a free action to attack it. Very smart.<br/><br/><i>Injury = more careful</i> -- Once people were Injured (which started in scene 2), there was a lot more pondering about how many danger dice to take -- danger dice are more likely to harm then help at that point. Maybe too much thinking and calculating. But then again they'd already had three Total Disasters, so they became very careful of figuring out what dice would lead to 5 or more danger (they got 7 danger twice in one round). That's a thematic concern: instead of getting more daring and taking more dice, once you're injured you're smarter to back off and take less dice, because the dice harm more than help.<br/><br/><i>Size of threats matters a lot less than number of threats</i> -- A single 12 threat is easy, one character can just plug away at it with tiny attacks, but that same character would get hammered by four 3 threats. That's because the size of the threat only influences danger when the threat is unharmed and gets a move, not when it's being attacked. Not sure what to do about that.<br/><br/><br/>All in all, lots of fun.

I think it would be <i>awesome</i>, and all styles/roles should have it: The Warrior is normally strong, but when the chips are down (and his meter is in the KO bracket) he becomes a unstoppable juggernaut of slaughter. The Mystic can <i>raise the dead from their graves!</i> Or something.<br/><br/>The Danger Patrol folks should be much more amazing when the danger is high. There should definitely be that tension of needing to get higher on the meter to get the job done, but know that you're courting disaster. Right now the top is a little too tilted towards caution. More power tokens help, but since you were also getting those at lower levels (and now all your dice are weaker, because you're probably injured) it isn't a clear shift into awesome.<br/><br/>If you didn't want to come up with special "limit break" powers for each, you could just make a blanket rule, like adding a free large die when you hit the upper ends of the meter (just imagine a big "d12" written in the KO section, or a d10 in KO and a d12 in vaporize). Another option would be to scale up bonus dice when you're at that level (d12-d10-d8 instead of d10-d8-d6)<br/><br/>EDIT: another strangely mean mechanic would be to just roll two dice for the skill you're testing instead of one. So near the top of the danger meter the super-commando rolls 2d12 instead of d12. The flipside is that people doing things they're bad at gets even worse (who wants 2d4)?<br/><br/><br/><i>Getting Rid of the Death Spiral</i> -- The more I think about it, the more I'm leaning towards Injury being just like Stunned: you need 5's on your next action, but then you're back to normal. Not because it's too hard, but because the death spiral doesn't fit the mood of the game -- it's not about being crippled, it's about boldly leaping into danger. Filling an injury box rather than a stun is still mechanically meaningful, because once your injuries fill the next injury rolls up to KO.<br/><br/>Even having one round where you need 5s can be pretty tense -- while you're taking a breather and rolling fewer dice, other threats are running rampant. Maybe you should risk more to take something out?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221017/#Comment_221017" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T15:19:28+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  3:19PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of higher-tier danger powers.

It is somewhat particular to this story because we happened to be separated all the time and one of the fights was social so Covering Fire didn't apply much, not to mention there is the meta thing of being hesitant to negate hits that aren't so bad.<br/><br/>However, I definitely struggled with the Command power. It seemed a waste of a Power token during Interlude scenes, and during action scenes why spend a power token to make a narrative statement that doesn't affect your dice?  In fights, there didn't seem to be an advantage to spending a token on Command when I could probably think of something interesting and psychic with the free mental powers - certainly less effective than any power that causes hits or reduced damage in some way for the same cost.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221188/#Comment_221188" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T13:34:15+00:00" title="July 28, 2009  1:34PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, a lot of the powers need a facelift.<br/><br/>I should also say in the text that swapping out your powers if you don't like them is fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221192/#Comment_221192" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T14:02:51+00:00" title="July 28, 2009  2:02PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2009 2:17PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm hoping the 2 bonus dice will change that -- it's like an attack power but random instead of automatic, which hopefully balances out that you can use it more narrative situations (combat and more subtle persuasion).<br/><br/>Another point about bonus dice powers that I missed in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9935" rel="nofollow">my fiddly power analysis</a> is that attack powers have no roll, so you can't rack up more danger/power, but powers that roll dice do.

Would Stunned be the same, but for one round? Offhand this feels good, but mathematically it'd be a much quicker spiral to the top of the danger meter and move from the Injured to the KO'd box in one roll which may not be the pacing you're looking for.<br/><br/>Sorry if this was covered elsewhere: If you take a KO hit, you're out and unconscious, right? I'd hate it if I worked so hard to get so close to the top to just be knocked out with no recourse in the penultimate box.

I think if you balance the powers such that they are all equally and mathematically cool and useful in their own way, then players will feel they can make good choices based on character concept. If you allow people to use other powers for 2 power tokens (or something), then they could have flexibility while the lure of getting a permanent new power remains strong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221202/#Comment_221202" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-28T14:42:00+00:00" title="July 28, 2009  2:42PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure you need anything to make danger happen faster once people are Injured -- they're already just a step away from KO, so even if they did play conservatively they would get there pretty quickly.<br/><br/>I'm leaning towards the carrot solution rather than the stick, tempting people with the 2x and 3x skill dice.

I like that idea. Either you have to do hits equal to their scale to keep them from making a move, or the hits you do knock down the move they can make.<br/><br/>Say you do two hits to a level three threat. Normally it can make a level 4 move, but now it can only do a level 2 move. Would that be hard to track?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221400/#Comment_221400" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T08:14:26+00:00" title="July 29, 2009  8:14AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it might be.<br/><br/>I think the secret is to always have a countdown or two on the board so the players have to make some interesting choices, or to stage the threats so you can't always get to the Master, or the Master Threat has Resistance so you may need to first go after the thing that's giving him Resistance.<br/><br/>Sure you could ping Baron Ivanov slowly if you were at a tea party, but the Baron's Death Ray is about to go off and Space Cadet Billy is being eaten by a T-Rex...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221449/#Comment_221449" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-29T11:42:13+00:00" title="July 29, 2009 11:42AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, Matthew has it right.
