Rather than playing the Gunlugger, or the Druid, or the Werewolf, players are the Greedy, or the Vengeful, or the Lonely. Motivation is often a secondary or tertiary reward mechanic (e.g. alignment) or simply assumed (e.g. classic D&amp;D characters, regardless of alignment, basically want to kill monsters and acquire riches), or implied (e.g. AW "special moves"), or even left entirely player-determined and nebulous. What if it were the primary, defining element of a "type" of character?<br/><br/>How would a game like this work? What mechanics would be required to back up the core idea? What other elements, besides class/motivation, would a character have to have on their sheet in order to make this work? (Presumably traditional sheets that tell you what you can *do* would be insufficient to support this, for all the weight that I think making motivation be the first thing a player selects would have.) What kind of stories would be best suited to this archetype? Is someone out there doing something like this already?<br/><br/>I'm interested to hear your thoughts about this.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455858/#Comment_455858" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-27T21:24:05+00:00" title="August 27, 2016  9:24PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might look at  Masks, which divides its heroes  by their social role within the team, with motivation a part of that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455859/#Comment_455859" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-27T21:24:50+00:00" title="August 27, 2016  9:24PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe swap around the XP stuff so something like:<br/><br/>Greedy<br/>When you prioritize getting coin out of the dungeon, mark XP<br/><br/>When getting coin puts another character at rick, mark XP and gain a Bond<br/><br/>When you cross the line and getting coin puts everyone's life on the line, mark 2XP<br/><br/>When you learn about an unpleasant consequence of your greedy actions, -1 XP and you can switch Motivations <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455860/#Comment_455860" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-27T21:57:34+00:00" title="August 27, 2016  9:57PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you removed all the DW class elements except for Alignment and Bonds, you'd be left with this.

If you want to build motivation into the character "playbooks", you need a flexible way to engage with that, and a way for it to change in play.<br/><br/>I could see a pretty cool system where motivations are built into the playbooks, yes, but also into each specific move. When you take a new move, you must discard an old one.<br/><br/>This means that the playbook you choose determines your starting position, so to speak, and direction. However, as you play, your direction is constantly changing. You choose new moves based on where you want your character to go.<br/><br/>There are a few good "motivation-based" playbooks in Monsterhearts (like the Mortal), but they always leave a lot flexibility in what the character's actual goals are.<br/><br/>On the other tentacle, some games are all about presenting a status quo and celebrating it. "I'm the character who is all about X." The premise is essentially static, and we just play to experience it again and again.<br/><br/>For a game like that, this idea could work really well. However, for this to work, you'd need to limit possible outcomes in some way, so that these motivations always remain relevant to play. Let me brainstorm some:<br/><br/>* The game is episodic, effectively "resetting" each time you play, so the character can always be given a way to engage with their motivation. (e.g. a different villain each session, a monster of the week, a new planet to explore, a new love interest to pursue)<br/><br/>Old-school D&amp;D is a little bit like this. The characters are always chasing treasure/XP, and it's just a different dungeon or mission each time.<br/><br/>* The object of the motivation can NEVER be reached. If your goal is Revenge, you'll spend the entire game chasing it, but actually achieving it can never be on the table.<br/><br/>I'm struggling to think of a particular example, but there are definitely some. A character like James Bond, who is always essentially the same, always dealing with the same problems, and never progresses beyond them.<br/><br/>* The object of the motivation CAN be reached. However, this is the endgame goal. Once you have reached your motivation, the game ends. (This can be a great design tool; I like games with strong endgame procedures.)<br/><br/>A nice middle ground could be found if the character changes playbooks whenever a motivation is fulfilled, of course.<br/><br/>Just be aware that you're funneling play into a very specific direction by doing this. It's certainly worth exploring, but don't go into it naively - there will be far-reaching consequences to the flow of the game. It certainly wouldn't play like AW anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455870/#Comment_455870" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-28T17:45:25+00:00" title="August 28, 2016  5:45PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2016 5:53PM by David_Berg.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One example leaps to mind, but it's from my own unpublished game <i>Delve</i>.  In brief:\n<blockquote>- Play requires that the player characters adventure together and work as a team.  Various aspects of the setting make this a sensible thing to do; beyond that, a requirement of character creation is that each character wants to pursue supernatural secrets.<br/><br/>- Reasons why a character might want to pursue supernatural secrets are divided into 4 Paths: Power, Fame, Plenty, and Humanity.  Choosing one such Path is the first step in establishing your character's personality and goals.  This is basically half your character; the other half is your adventuring capabilities.<br/><br/>- The four Paths are all relative to starting out as a poor villager, so there's plenty to do without ever getting to an endpoint*.  <b>The Path of Power</b> means striving for personal potency in the setting.  Dreamed-of end goals could be anything from "unkillable warrior" to "king".  <b>The Path of Fame</b> is pretty self-explanatory: striving to be known far and wide in the manner that you wish, whether that's with reverence or fear or something else.  <b>The Path of Plenty</b> means striving to eventually carve out a space in this hostile world where you can retire and relax in comfort, possibly with friends and family.  <b>The Path of Humanity</b> is a crusade to defend and better mankind.<br/><br/>- The reward system is about the GM presenting opportunities to further those Paths, in the form of (a) supernatural secrets which make the player characters matter in the setting in a way in which they previously didn't, and (b) setting features responsive to that newfound relevance -- impressed nobles, imperial employers, ancient priesthoods, traveling bards, lands and valuable missions for the taking, potential friends in places low and high.</blockquote>\nThat's how <i>Delve</i> works, but in another game I think it'd be easy enough to let Path, goal and personality dictate "so here are the sorts of things you've been doing and here are the sorts of adventuring skills you've picked up."  For example, it'd be simple enough to say that Power-seekers become <b>wizards</b>, Fame-seekers become <b>knights</b>, Plenty-seekers become <b>rogues</b>, and Humanity-advocates become <b>clerics</b>.<br/><br/>The reward system could be formalized into levels, which could be earned much like in some versions of old D&amp;D where you fight for loot and then spend the loot to level up.  You <b>level in Power</b> by poring over the arcana you've acquired, reading tomes, performing experiments, opening your brain, etc.  You <b>level in Fame</b> by telling the tale of your latest adventure to bards and innkeepers and travelers and town leaders.  You <b>level in Plenty</b> by securing useful connections and resources, such as by calling in favors for folks whose relatives or homes you've saved in the course of your adventuring.  Successfully negotiating imperial payment counts as a step along this Path too.  Finally, you <b>level in Humanity</b> every time you disseminate a new protection against evil or bulwark for civilization, or simply learn a new link in the chain toward safeguarding mankind's future against one or all of its many enemies.<br/><br/>As for the final piece of a core system, how the characters progress or fail to moment-by-moment, I dunno, aptitudes derived from Wizard/Knight/Rogue/Cleric might be good enough.  But if you want to boost the "all about motivation" dimension then you could rope in a "get an extra die if you can say how this action furthers your Path" mechanic.  And if you want to minimize distracting associations, you could create bundles of adventuring skills without ever naming them "Wizard" or "Knight" or anything.  Just call them Path of Power skills, Path of Fame skills, etc.<br/><br/>* I think this, plus the broad nature of the Paths, answers Paul and Hasimir's concerns about getting static or pigeonholed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jangler" title="jangler"><img alt="jangler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jangler">jangler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455877/#Comment_455877" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-28T21:49:18+00:00" title="August 28, 2016  9:49PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2016 9:50PM by jangler.">edited August 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>A different approach to motivation, which I like a lot more, are the KEYs from The Shadow of Yesterday / Solar System.<br/>They are a perfect mechanization of motivation.</blockquote>\nSeconded; I really like the Keys mechanism from TSoY. The thing is that they're mercurial, though \u2013 you can "buy off" a Key to get a bunch of XP if your character advances beyond that motivation.<br/><br/>I like David's idea but at the same time it feels like an unnecessary coupling of motivation and character abilities.

I think it's a cool thought experiment.<br/><br/>Another idea -- maybe take any skill you want, but when you choose it, you must say how you acquired it while pursuing your Path, or in order to better pursue your Path, or something else to bring it back to motivations.  And then maybe such explanations can interface with the story of "what you've done to pursue your motivation(s) thus far", which in turn can help the GM provide good Path-relevant content in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
