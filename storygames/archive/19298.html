Could be modern, 1950s British, 1930s/40s noir, etc. Just curious if anyone's seen anything like that yet, as I suspect the 10/7-9/6 system would work well re: clues, so it's not a binary state of either finding a clue or missing it? <br/><br/>Or do I stick with my Walmsley (Taste for Murder) as my go-to detective RPG?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429775/#Comment_429775" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-23T12:15:19+00:00" title="March 23, 2014 12:15PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Check out <a href="http://genericgames.co.nz/" rel="nofollow">Monster of the Week</a>! In the Files section, have a look at the Hunter basic moves. Although it styles as a "monster-hunting" game, most of the game is actually an investigation, to the point where you could run it as a straight mystery with a few tweaks to the moves. You'd just have to change the focus of the playbooks.

When it comes to creating a mystery for PCs to solve, the ice is a lot thinner.  Vincent has written some <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9cu0IVYfHtidTJxNlZQR2NRTVE/edit" rel="nofollow">Mystery rules</a> but they're quite abstract.  The goal there is structuring a Mystery as a Front.  <br/><br/>I'm building some more structuralist mystery rules myself but I don't think they're ready for reveal.  But I've also started looking at the <a href="http://www.pelgranepress.com/?p=13319" rel="nofollow">Gumshoe</a> system, and Robin Laws has some thought-provoking things to say about solving mysteries in RPGs... this often <i>sucks</i> because the players spend a lot of time failing rolls and missing clues.  Professional ass-kicking investigators wouldn't have stupid problems like that.  The AW narrative approach doesn't really have that problem, but still, approaching a mystery as a Front leaves a lot of structure up in the air, and it can be really difficult to come up with a good one.<br/><br/>As the Gumshoe rules say: "The central question a traditional RPG asks is: <i><b>Will the heroes get the information they need?</b></i>  Assuming that they look in the right place and apply appropriate abilities to the task, GUMSHOE ensures that the heroes get the basic clues they need to move through the story. The question it asks is: <i><b>What will the heroes do with the information once they\u2019ve got it?</b></i> "<br/><br/>Continuing the quote because it's pertinent:<br/>"If you think about it, this is how the source materials we base our mystery scenarios on handle clues. You don\u2019t see the forensic techies on CSI failing to successfully use their lab equipment, or Sherlock Holmes stymied and unable to move forward because he blew his Zoology roll.  You don\u2019t see this because, in a story failure to gain information is rarely more interesting than getting it. New information opens up new narrative possibilities, new choices and actions for the characters. Failure to get information is a null result that takes you nowhere."<br/><br/>So now I'm considering ways to "shoehorn the gumshoe" approach into a "powered by the apocalypse" approach.  Maybe you can get some mileage out of asking yourself the same question. :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429781/#Comment_429781" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-23T14:44:27+00:00" title="March 23, 2014  2:44PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 23, 2014 2:45PM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>So now I'm considering ways to "shoehorn the gumshoe" approach into a "powered by the apocalypse" approach.

In our MotW session, moves <i>generated</i> clues alongside their interpretation. I started by deciding the situation (a dragon had rampaged into an art gallery, before gaining control and turning back into a human, then cleaning things up in a hurry) and then seeing what questions the players asked with "Investigate a Mystery".<br/><br/>So when one of them asked "What type of creature was it?" I filled in a detail: "you find some claw marks, which were obscured by a painting". It wasn't contradicting any information given before, and it's logically connected to the questions being asked. I guess it comes with this presumption: the clues present at the scene are sufficient to provide information about what happened and who did it. I guess if you look closely enough, it doesn't make sense, but it worked out perfectly when we played.<br/><br/>There's a key difference between *World and GUMSHOE, too, and it's a difference in philosophy I agree with: <b>it's okay to fail</b>. Robin Laws didn't like failures in investigative cases, but *World games introduce the idea that failure can still advance the story and remain failure. MotW suggests several ways that can happen. If you miss an "Investigate a Mystery" roll, word gets out that you're digging into the mystery, for instance.<br/><br/>Also, the game doesn't itemize clues and skills. You just roll the same move for all clues, and specialties don't enter into it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429782/#Comment_429782" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-23T14:50:10+00:00" title="March 23, 2014  2:50PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree.
