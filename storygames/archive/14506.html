The purpose of that scene is to answer the Question, and when the Question is answered, the scene ends.<br/><br/>I was really excited about this when I played, and I still am. I just wrote a roleplaying-poem-ish game about doubt (see my notebook, in my backpack), that uses this same thing for scenes.<br/><br/>What I want to know: Is Microscope the first game to do this, to have scenes framed around a single Question? I'm also interested in Ben's influences for this scene mechanic, and if he doesn't pop in here, I'll hit him up directly and post his answer.<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330385/#Comment_330385" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-17T04:33:27+00:00" title="June 17, 2011  4:33AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was struck by the simple elegance of this procedure myself.

"what does it look like people are using for transportation?" "what kind of wildlife do we think we see?" And use randomly chosen words to inspire mysterious and baffling descriptions. The main mechanics are used to answer questions about how the world works once you have these descriptions. <br/><br/>Questions are good places to start for collaboration in a co-gm'd game. And they create openings for everyone to be surprised. Again, a good thing when there is no one person crafting a world or story elements for others to stumble upon and interact with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330437/#Comment_330437" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-17T11:21:55+00:00" title="June 17, 2011 11:21AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have no idea if Microscope is the first. It seems like a very obvious way to do things in hindsight.<br/><br/>Yep, the scene Question has been in there since the very first draft. The only thing that changed was it moved up to step one, where it always should have been: if you don't have a Question, you don't have a scene. That also helped break people of the habit of thinking of framing a scene the way they normally did and then saying "oh, wait, I don't have a question!"<br/><br/>I made it as a direct response to problems I had+saw playing other games before Microscope. Someone would frame a scene and they'd start the ball rolling and then other players would jump in and role-play. Somewhere in the middle, the person who made the scene would frown and start to pull back and say "uh that stuff with his brother is great, but actually, I made this scene because I really wanted to get at X" but by then the scene had gone in a totally different direction, because the other players had no idea that was the scene framer's unspoken agenda. Keeping the agenda hidden just seemed to invite that kind of misunderstanding.<br/><br/>As tricksy as it sounds, in hindsight I'd say the Question is different from questions in a lot of other games because it's really an answer to the unspoken question "what did you want this scene to be about?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330444/#Comment_330444" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-17T11:55:45+00:00" title="June 17, 2011 11:55AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2011 12:06PM by Hans_c-o.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Robbins</cite><br/>As tricksy as it sounds, in hindsight I'd say the Question is different from questions in a lot of other games because it's really an answer to the unspoken question "what did you want this scene to be about?"</blockquote>\nYeah, that seems to be it.

(or the issue -- know what the scene's about)<br/>* Producer frames the scene<br/>* Play out the scene until the question should be called -- sometimes that's early, sometimes you build tension first<br/>* Call question, figure out who gets the Last Word<br/>* Play out, briefly, what the audience sees in resolving the question<br/><br/>It's been incredibly brilliant. One memorable bit was in a dark sci-fi game, it was the last act of the episode. The crew were trapped in hyperspace with enemies around, and the engineer (who was playing his first episode of PTA ever) said "I guess the question is 'Do I repair the ship?'"<br/><br/>We all said "No! Of course you fix the ship, it's the final few minutes of the episode." One player proposed "Do I finally gain the respect of everyone else in this moment of crisis?" and we loved it.<br/><br/>Then we played the scene out, our job being to make the question <em>matter</em>. There was some berating in character against the engineer, the engineer sweating it out, and then he said "okay, punch the hyperdrive now!" and we called cards.<br/><br/>He fought HARD for that one, spending all his fan mail to get four cards. He won and got Last Word, so we showed the dialogue and exposition. "The hyperdrive comes up instantly, and the thrust of breaking back into normal space is felt by all, moments before the missiles would have hit." One character, the captain, said "Well done, Boone." Nods were exchanged. At the end of that episode, the marine commanded bought him a drink as the credits rolled.<br/><br/>Which is to illustrate that the power of scene questions lies in selling the importance of the question <em>and</em> showing the result of it. Both parts shouldn't be played out the exhaustion, but that's why it's a skill rather than something that we all automatically know.<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330466/#Comment_330466" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-17T13:00:40+00:00" title="June 17, 2011  1:00PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans C-O</cite>Is that exactly how it works in PTA--a question is asked, a scene is framed around it, question's answered/scene's done?</blockquote>\nNo, not explicitly.<br/><br/>You address an Issue, and there's a conflict that is addressed, but no indication that you need to kill the scene right then and there, immediately, when the conflict is addressed (which is what the Question mechanic asks you to do).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330468/#Comment_330468" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-17T13:03:37+00:00" title="June 17, 2011  1:03PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2011 1:04PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>but no indication that you need to kill the scene right then and there</blockquote>\nSomething I consider a weakness in Microscope.

You've refined it to something sharper, in effect inventing the same Question mechanic as Microscope uses. Again, not surprising, since I think it's a pretty logical next step.<br/><br/>In PTA, Agenda is what is happening in the scene, not why we are playing the scene. In Microscope, the parallel is in step 2 (establish what is going on). In PTA, "the question" emerges when you decide on the conflict during role-play, just like conflicts in most games (play the scene until you find the conflict). You don't set it when you frame the scene.<br/><br/>(to skip a lot of vague back and forth, here's the PTA text)\n<blockquote><b>Agenda:</b> The agenda is a general description of what happens in the scene. It shouldn't explain how the scene resolves, but instead should explain what the likely conflict is. An example of an agenda on the show <i>Lost</i> would be "Locke and Boone are trying to open the secret hatch they've found buried in the ground." Knowing whether the scene addresses plot or characters will tell you what sort of things should take place while they're working.</blockquote>\nI think that example makes it pretty clear they're different beasts.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>Another place where a designer threw out the baby with the bathwater that is "this skill isn't easy to master."</blockquote>\nWho, me?

A question on the other hand needs to be answered, and the fact that the scene ends when an answer is provided further suggests that the answer must be singular and final.<br/><br/>This is not a criticism of either approach, and I'm not saying that there isn't some shared history or progression there -- but Questions in Microscope have a very different feel. I <i>was</i> going to mention Sign in Stranger as the closest parallel, but Emily beat me to it. Even there though, in SiS the questions are not conclusively answered for some time -- and in fact you are explicitly forbidden from answering them at first.
