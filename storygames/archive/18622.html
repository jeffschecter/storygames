I hadn\u2019t really given the project a huge amount of thought up to now but since there\u2019s a bit of interest I\u2019ll get to work on producing a playtest draft; and, rather than starting a new thread in the Game Design Help forum, if it\u2019s ok with everyone I\u2019ll update folks on any progress in this thread.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Biest">@Biest</a> <a href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">@CarpeGuitarrem</a> Yeah, it\u2019s a very interesting period, and well worth looking at for settings and themes other than the traditional Lovecraftian ones (although those are fun too). It was the period after WWI when it really seemed as if anything was possible, particularly in terms of sexual mores and freedom of expression. Women over 30 were given the vote in the UK in 1918, with full suffrage coming a decade later; the class system began to break up, and the Labour Party made huge inroads politically. <br/><br/>It was also at this time that a discernible drug culture emerged; although people had been using cocaine and opiates recreationally since the 19C, it wasn\u2019t until the early 20C that restrictive drug laws were introduced, thereby classing their users as criminal, which in turn created a drug sub-culture that continues to this day. Syncopated Jazz became fashionable and pervasive, breaking from the tradition of the heavily orchestrated and constrained music of previous centuries, and crucially it was a musical genre that originated in African-American culture, thus allowing African-Americans to exert an unprecedented influence on Anglo- and by extension world- culture, and paving the way for the enormous variety of musical styles we have today. <br/><br/>In the US specifically, you had Prohibition, the overt and powerful gangsterism of people like Al Capone, and, as with the UK and other countries, an \u2018anything goes\u2019 mentality that was ultimately shattered by the global economic meltdown of the 1930s, which to those of a moralising disposition must have seemed like a Providential reckoning for all the cocaine-snorting, ukele-strumming Bright Young Things.  <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_Riddle">@Paul_Riddle</a> Thanks for the tip, I\u2019ll check it out. And, is this\u2026\n<blockquote>Read Baker's treatise on game design in sundered land.

What I want out of a game is usually to do with atmosphere and feel, rather than various victory conditions for the player party, which is why I\u2019m much more interested in narrative games than the more traditional \u2018I hit it with my axe\u2019 type. So I have to work out how to create the feel I\u2019m going for with Disgraceful, which is a sort of blend of Guys and Dolls, LA Confidential and Fiasco. In addition, and perhaps overriding all of the above, is the objective of attempting to recreate at the table the atmosphere of the 1920s in the UK and the US, i.e. the decadence, the gaiety, and the Twin Peaks-style surface social glitter papering over a morally bankrupt society.  <br/><br/>Oh, and add three more influences: Miller\u2019s Crossing for the political corruption (although it was set in the 1940s it\u2019s still relevant to the period we\u2019re talking about), Some Like It Hot for the sheer exuberance of the Jazz Age (and a bit of light-hearted gangsterism- remember the St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre pastiche at the beginning?) and pretty well every film starring Busby Berkeley or Eddie Cantor. I should add that in terms of the movie industry the 1920s was a period of enormous creative licence that was only brought to an abrupt halt by the promulgation of the Hayes Code in1930, which meant that forex in a bedroom scene both leads had to have at least one foot on the floor! <br/><br/>I\u2019ll get to work on trying to put in practice the above, and I\u2019ll post here from time to time to get folks\u2019 thoughts <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(And apologies for the bulky text).    <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418612/#Comment_418612" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-18T10:27:13+00:00" title="July 18, 2013 10:27AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2013 10:28AM by catty_big.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apologies dude, I didn't spot this earlier:<blockquote>One of my personal favorite shows is <i>Baccano!</i>, which is what you'd get if Quentin Tarantino directed a series about 1930s mobsters with supernatural elements.

I wanted to set the game in New York, so there could be characters (mainly the Grey Hats) who weren\u2019t necessarily involved in the film industry (or Broadway, as I was thinking at the time), but would be living there anyway. But by the 1920s the film industry was already well established in Hollywood. Solution? Have every character be involved in the film industry in some way (which would become like a \u2018beacon\u2019 of immorality throughout the entire game), and let each character have a prologue where they say why/how they came to be there, using their character sheet (dreams/ambitions and worries/fears etc.) for inspiration. <br/><br/>So, to the mechanics, and here I\u2019ve discovered something very interesting: I\u2019ve played and read about an awful of collaborative story games over the last couple of years, and looking over my notes I find that I\u2019ve pretty much taken all the mechanics I\u2019ve got from various other games. It might help orientate folks if I say which mechanic I\u2019ve taken from where. So\u2026<br/><br/><b>1. From My Life with Master</b>: each player distributes x number of points over three main stats: Fortitude, Ambition and Fear. Task resolution involves rolling against two of these (and maybe eventually some other stats). So forex, if a movie mogul is trying to get the Aspiring Starlet character to sleep with him, she rolls her FORT (ability to resist temptation) minus her AMB, against the mogul\u2019s FORT, plus or minus other hindrances/advantages that have built up in-game. <br/><b>2.\tFrom Hot War/Fiasco</b>: establish relationships with one or more other PCs, for both roleplaying and mechanical advantage/disadvantage.<br/><b>3. From MLwM</b>: establish connections with Grey Hats.<br/><b>4. From DramaSystem</b>: collect points for [not sure] which can be spent on compelling other characters to do things for you. <br/><b>5. From Montsegur 1244, Witch: the Road to Lindisfarne and other similar games</b>: questions that the characters answer through play.<br/><b>6. From Battlestar Galactica</b>: if FORT dips below a set level (Zero points?) a PC can themselves become a Black Hat, FORT immediately goes up to max level, and they can attack other characters. If FORT goes above the max level, the PC becomes a White Hat and FORT stays at max. Can then <i>help</i> other characters.<br/><br/>The above is similar to the BSG board game in that when cylons are revealed part way during the game they don\u2019t have to pretend not to be cylons anymore, and therefore can do greater damage. Not entirely sure it would work for Disgraceful though.<br/><br/>I see FORT as the pivotal stat of the game, because it\u2019s how the PCs resist temptation, and it will go up and down during the game as they wrestle with their inner demons. I\u2019m thinking of making it increase arithmetically, but decrease exponentially, so that if say they do a good turn for someone it increases by 1, whereas if they do something bad, it decreases by 1 the first time, 2 the second, and 3 the third, etc. <br/><br/>Game structure: as I\u2019ve put on the burb, I\u2019m intending to go for a lasagne-like structure, with play alternating between flavour scenes and ones where the PCs interact mechanically with the gameworld, various NPCs and each other:<br/><br/>Act  0. Prologue (no points given out).<br/>Act 1<br/>a. Scenes that establish relationships and reveal questions etc.<br/>b. \u2018Combat\u2019 with Black Hat, or interaction with Grey Hat.<br/>Act 2<br/>a. More establishing scenes, which can include stuff from both 1a and 1 b.<br/>b. More combat (plus interaction with White Hat- solicit help from WH).<br/>Interval- OOC chat*.<br/>Act 3<br/>a. As 2a.<br/>b. As 2b.<br/>4. Pulling together strands- tilt?<br/>5. Epilogues.<br/><br/><b>Possible characters</b>:<br/><b>Pink Hat</b>: Lily Fox (real name Bridget Maloney)- aspiring movie star, wants a lead role or to marry millionaire. Na\xefve. Sick mother.<br/><b>Red Hat</b>: Jimmy Drake, disgruntled former shop/hotel employee)- wants to be script-writer.  Angry at being dismissed. Impetuous, no self-control.<br/><b>Yellow Hat</b>: Billy Kowalski- gossip writer, wants a scoop. Works for tabloid paper whose editor has no morals. Weak-willed, can\u2019t say no. <br/><b>Green Hat</b>: Simeon \u2018Stookie\u2019 Michaels- cabbie, wants to own fleet of taxis. Jealous of his rich customers.<br/><br/>Finally, I'm in the process of trying to re-invigorate my blog (which is code for finally getting round to doing something with it). In general, are folks happy with the approach I've adopted thus far, i.e. every now and then do a summary of where I am with the project, as I've done here, or would they prefer a link to my blog/website when it's ready so that interested parties can go and read about it it there?

To respond to your points:\n<blockquote>I am not sure if I'd like the focus on the movie industry or Hollywood. I think a focus on the nightlife might be better, which can be different in every city and the people do not necessarily need things in common other than the party they are attending or whatever temptations are around.</blockquote>\nI had Hollywood in mind originally because of the 'casting couch' type stuff, and influences like the book Hollywood Babylon, as well as trials of noted Hollywood figures such as Busby Berkeley and Fatty Arbuckle. I also thought Broadway would be an appropriate setting (cf. Woody Allen's film Bullets Over Broadway), but I think you're right that the nightlife of a big city would provide a much better one- as you point out, the characters wouldn't have to have anything in common. Also, you could then have other characters who just happen to be there, whereas in Hollywood people are there pretty much just for the movie industry, so the focus would be too narrow. I think it would have to be a big city like New York though, so that the PCs can have gone there hoping to hit the big time, and possibly be very naive, due to their coming from a small town. <br/><br/>As for the time period, I definitely want it to be the 1920s, not just because I'm interested in the period, both musically and historically, but because it was a time when it seemed like anything was possible, and there was a general loosening of morals, followed by a crash (the Wall Street Crash and the Great Depression). I'm sure the game would be moddable to other, similar periods, such as the 1890s (Decadence in art and culture followed by WWI) or the 1960s (post-50s austerity and pre- the oil shocks and industrial strife etc. of the 70s), but the 1920s has Art Deco, Jazz music (much more original and inventive than the pop pap of the 60s), votes for women, Prohibition and the emergent drug culture.  \n<blockquote><br/>A workable playtest draft always is a good thing or a blog where you explain in greater detail.</blockquote>\nOk, I'll come back when I've got more of a handle on the mechanics; I appreciate that my brain dump earlier may not have been terribly helpful. I'm in the process of setting up a website to market this and other games, alongside a general overhaul of my blog (indyhippo.wordpresss.com) which I've hardly done anything with since I set it up at the beginning of this year <img alt=":blush:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/blush.png" title=":blush:"/>\n<blockquote>Also Boardwalk Empire is coming back for a new season in a few weeks</blockquote>\nThanks for reminding me! I never actually got round to watching the original series; I'll have to try to watch it on netflix or something.<br/><br/>Edit: I intend the temptations to be more than just sex, drugs &amp; <del>Rock &amp; Roll</del> Jazz. They could include things like the boy/girlfriend of one the characters asking them to hide a gun for them, or hide them from the police etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420595/#Comment_420595" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-22T18:19:11+00:00" title="August 22, 2013  6:19PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah definatly stick with the 1920s era for the game.

The point is the moral choice, so if there <i>is</i> any crime, it\u2019ll be in the form of an external stimulus pushing the PC to action, i.e. whether or not to resist the temptation, so the example I gave earlier- Character X\u2019s boyfriend asking her to hide a gun or knife- will lead to a skill check, the result directing Character X\u2019s roleplaying from that point on. <br/><br/><b>Fortitude sounds really out of place. Greed, Fear and Ambition? Fear and Ambition work for me. Fortitude sounds like it's wandered in from some other game system. </b><br/>Haha, yes, Fortitude doesn\u2019t have quite the right ring to it. That stat represents the characters\u2019 ability to resist the temptations, and is going to be pretty central to the system, but I agree with you that a different name would reflect its function better. Maybe Resolve, or Moral Compass? And, as I said earlier, while an increase would be arithmetic, a decrease would be exponential, representing the fact that after you\u2019ve given into temptation once, it becomes that much easier the next time, and the next, etc.<br/><br/>Ambition and Fear work for me too. I was intending Ambition to be the counterweight to Resolve (or whatever I end up calling the resistance-type stat), so if you go to a party and are offered drugs, if you have high Ambition and low Resolve you\u2019re much less likely to resist; in terms of the fiction, you\u2019ll tell yourself that going with the flow is important because if you do you\u2019ll be popular and make the right contacts etc., and you'll keep telling yourself that, until you eventually start to believe your own lies.  Essentially it\u2019s the concept of the slippery slope.<br/><br/>I mentioned MLwM in my brain dump upthread as an example of a game with minimalist statting, so Ambition, Fear and Resolve would be pretty much it. (There, it looks like Fortitude has now become Resolve). Oh, and I want to see what task resolution would be like using cards instead of dice, a la games like Duty &amp; Honour and Umlaut.   <br/><br/><b>Not sure about the black hat/white hat thing.

It\u2019s a bit of a gimmick tbh, but the idea is a serious one. The PCs are indeed a mixture of good and bad, and during the game could go either way, i.e. more good or more bad. The Black and White Hats are lead NPCs/GMCs (gang boss and priest, say), who have a very high Resolve stat, and are either very good or very bad. I\u2019m not sure yet how the PCs would interact with them mechanically, or whether the GM would introduce them in form of obstacles, or \u2018Wandering monsters\u2019 or whatever, but essentially they\u2019d be the equivalent of the Big Bad(/Big Good?) of a combat game, only they\u2019d be omnipresent in the game rather than appear at its close. <br/><br/>The Grey Hats? Well, I\u2019m less clear about their function, but atm I\u2019m thinking of them as morally ambiguous minor NPCs, who will interact with the PCs in some way, probably as in the dodgy boyfriend example mentioned above. The reason I\u2019m giving the NPCs coloured Hats is to signify that they\u2019re more rounded <i>mechanically</i>  than the Grey Hats, so forex they\u2019ll be fully statted whereas the GHs won\u2019t, but, as I say, it\u2019s a bit of a gimmick, and if folks aren\u2019t sold on the idea I could well drop it. This is the point of Open Game Design: there are a few points that are non-negotiable, but not many.<br/><br/><b>I appreciate it's on the backburner, but those are my thoughts for now anyway.</b><br/>No, that\u2019s great. This kind of feedback is enormously helpful; although the game\u2019s now on the back burner my brain will continue to accept submissions, which it will add to the pot pending its transferral back to the front burner <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420807/#Comment_420807" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-28T03:10:02+00:00" title="August 28, 2013  3:10AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a short comment to say that Resolve is much better than Fortitude.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420836/#Comment_420836" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-28T14:15:35+00:00" title="August 28, 2013  2:15PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ObXzrP4wdc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ObXzrP4wdc</a><br/>Is a video about the Algonquin Round Table and seems like an interesting source for this game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420845/#Comment_420845" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-28T17:11:12+00:00" title="August 28, 2013  5:11PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2013 5:12PM by catty_big.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks dude! That was a very interesting watch. You can never have enough Dorothy Parker IMO. And it would help to inject a lighter element: I\u2019m not aiming for it to be a massively high emotion game; nor do I intend for it to be a deeply philosophical, Tolkeinesque battle between Good and Evil, the Black and White Hats being mechanical rather than allegorical.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/D-503">@D-503</a> I agree, Resolve does sound a lot better than Fortitude. Btw I loved the way you described Fortitude as 'wandering in from some other game'.  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
