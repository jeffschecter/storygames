As I've searched the net, it seems what is closest to my vision is a parlor style LARP or a theater style LARP.  I've started a meetup group and hope to have my first "play" in a month or so. I've started developing a story and what I have so far is listed below. I'm hoping for some guidance regarding plot development, plot twists, or just feedback you have would be really appreciated. I'm trying to develop an immersive experience including sound effects and other props/effects, and VERY light on rules/systems.<br/><br/>NAME: The Conclave: Trouble in the Hidden World<br/><br/>GENRE: Blended fantasy (werewolf, vampire, fey, witch/wizard, elf, etc) in modern day setting.<br/><br/>NARRATIVE SO FAR:<br/>A group of Others meet in a dungeon or cave. It is dark, full of comforting shadows. *Me*, the wolf, has summoned them to conclave, after everyone having noted these events over the last several months. They discuss the growing danger in the world. The danger is as yet undefined, yet unsettling for most at conclave. There is a sense something is coming, but it is unclear what or why.<br/>There are signs of things amiss in the hidden world. A raven fell out of the sky. A group of tadpoles died en masse in the river, before becoming frogs. Fires take longer to stoke, and are more difficult to keep burning. Humans sometimes seem to "see" us, to recognize us, more so than is usual for them. The night is long, but somehow not as safe.<br/>And now...rabbits and deer are not as plentiful for the wolves. More humans are wearing crosses, making it difficult for the vampires to take nourishment from them. Flowers are not producing enough nector for the fey to make good honey wine. Spellcasting is becoming burdensome, taking more energy with lesser results.<br/>What is causing this? It seems to be affecting the entire Other world. Who or what is behind it? (GOAL OF EVENING)<br/><br/>STORY ARC:<br/>Weird and unsettling things are happening in the Hidden World. It has gotten to the point that a conclave is called, a gathering of Others who do not usually mingle with each other, in order to discuss the growing unease and what or who might be behind it. The goal of the evening/game is for the Others to discover the Villain-in-the-shadow, perhaps via video email announcement from the Villain at end of evening (video email could work because the setting is modern day).<br/><br/>PLOT ELEMENTS:<br/>Why is Villain casting a pall over our world? What is Villain\u2019s motivation?<br/>Subplot: One Other (unknown at first?) suspects, then accuses, another of being behind the weird and unsettling happenings. <br/>Subplot:  Vying for power or control regarding who is in charge of the plan to oust or defeat the Villain<br/><br/>SOUND EFFECTS:<br/>General cave background \u2013 non-threatening<br/>Heavy sub-bass thrum for announcement of VIS, or at various times to build ominous atmosphere<br/>Wolf howl \u2013 "Franceso", annoyed at being left out of the conclave<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425034/#Comment_425034" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-01T15:44:42+00:00" title="December  1, 2013  3:44PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello! This sounds lovely. I'd like to play.<br/><br/>One good question for players is: what do the players/characters do? If I've just started playing this game, what do I do? There's a hint of talking about the problems affecting the wolves, which I like. There's the overall goal of hunting for the villain. How does that translate to what I do in the game?<br/><br/>I think it's useful to think about games that might serve as a model. For example: is your game like Werewolf, in which you must guess who the werewolf is? Or is it like Fiasco, in which all the characters have relationships and the game emerges from those? Or is it like a British freeform, in which all the characters have goals, and the game emerges from them pursuing their goals?<br/><br/>What does it feel like to play this game? Is it a witch hunt, tense and fast, in which we hunt for the villain? Or is it slow and thoughtful, as we explore the problems affecting the wood?<br/><br/>Lots of questions! I hope you don't mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wannaplaypretend" title="wannaplaypretend"><img alt="wannaplaypretend" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wannaplaypretend">wannaplaypretend</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425037/#Comment_425037" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-01T16:10:15+00:00" title="December  1, 2013  4:10PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 1, 2013 4:17PM by wannaplaypretend.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham - <br/>Great questions! Thanks!<br/>I'm hoping to design a cooperative game, so not like Werewolf because no player will actually be VIS. My roommate (who won't play) will play VIS via video mail if needed. VIS is a separate not-on-scene character. So, one problem is, how to not make the game be too good vs. evil, but more about alliances between races that do not usually ally, and finding out who or what is disturbing their world. I'm still unsure of motivation of the VIS.<br/>I'd like to try it where the characters develop the game themselves, with me as GM throwing in a few plot elements and overall structure (which overall is, finding out the VIS is not someone in the room, who/what VIS is, and what is motivating VIS).<br/>I'm going to have food and wine, so the game will initially be about characters meeting/greeting, interacting, offering information on what they have noticed in the Hidden World, speculating on what might be going on, etc.<br/>It feels a bit like a UN meeting, I suppose, somewhat tense but a greater goal is bringing them together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425041/#Comment_425041" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-02T00:08:23+00:00" title="December  2, 2013 12:08AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I like the ideas here.  Two questions that spring to mind for me: <br/><br/>1) What are good reasons for the groups keeping apart? <br/><br/>If the groups are supposed to be coming together, there need to be good reasons to stay apart (so there is tension), but ultimately stronger reasons to make an alliance. <br/><br/>2) What is the method by which they will find out more about the Villian-in-the-Shadow?  <br/><br/>The traditional would be to scatter clues about it among different characters, which will add up to more if they pool their information - and possibly have further hints to be given later by you as organizer as the game goes on. A more story-gamish possibility is that the players can create their own information and create who the villain is through improvisation. <br/><br/>I have an old Knutepunkt article on creating larps based around different factions, though it's not an easy read.

Humans Vs Monsters Diplomacy is a great game for 6 players, and Trapped is excellent for 4. Either would be a perfect way to host a first larp. <br/><a href="http://www.interactivitiesink.com/larps/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.interactivitiesink.com/larps/</a> <br/><br/>The RPG.Net list of free larps is also a good place to look. The one's from Mike's page are repeated there, and there are many others. The ones from Shifting Forest Storyworks are particularly worth checking out.<br/><a href="http://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/LARP_Scenarios" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/LARP_Scenarios</a><br/><br/>For anyone trying out the medium of larp for the first time on their own, especially someone interested in dramatic games (as opposed to sword-fighty games), I highly recommend starting with some well-trod ground rather than trying to do everything from scratch on your own right from the start.<br/><br/>Also - campaigns (multiple, linked games) are hard. Start with one-shots. You need to learn about how certain things pace out before you can plan for a campaign arc. You would be surprised at how certain plot developments can happen lightning fast in a larp, while other things will drag on forever that you thought would take 10 minutes. And, in the end, some things are unpredictable and you need to learn to recognize how things are going and adjust on the fly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wannaplaypretend" title="wannaplaypretend"><img alt="wannaplaypretend" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wannaplaypretend">wannaplaypretend</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425256/#Comment_425256" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-04T19:21:46+00:00" title="December  4, 2013  7:21PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2013 7:29PM by wannaplaypretend.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, you are discouraging me, in fact.

I've written three and it took me several months to write the amount I did for the one shot games. The key to getting LARP to work is that you want to minimize the amount the players are dependent on you for information.  I usually accomplish this in my games by writing character summaries for each character motivations and affiliations along with knowledge they have about other characters.  I include these thing:<br/>*many different groups with motivations that can't see eye to eye.  <br/>*information in different parts to different players who want different things from the information. <br/>*reasons for the players to interact and not to want to interact in interesting combinations.<br/><br/>You've got a good setup for a lot of these. <br/><br/>I would draft half page sheets for each player including:<br/><br/>1. Name<br/><br/>2. Affiliation with Villain (You should have more than one on that side and I also agree  with one of the above posters that you should let a PC be the villain) and possibly two groups that want different things from resolution of the mystery... perhaps.. a group that wants to kill the Villain and another which wants to capture and use the power for their own ends.  Strife is the key to any LARP and the more disagreement the more discussion and character interaction you will have.<br/><br/>3. A small backstory with some events you've been privy to and some omen you saw in relation to the coming evil.  Possibly a couple of bits of information on how to stop it.<br/><br/>4. List of other characters and one line with what you know about that character (that character should know as well what they are not necessarily that others know).<br/><br/><br/>I wrote a dinner party one shot larp and went to the thrift store and picked up some cool knickknacks for a few dollars.  Each of these were used in a final ritual to banish an evil type thing.   The trick was getting them and getting them all on one side.   It's kinda important to have timed events in a one shot to pace the game.  For example, if the game will take 6 hours.  Have 6 events with pertinent information distributed every hour.  You should not be playing however.  You will be needed to answer questions and allow PC's to enact plans and off screen action.  I promise you will be too busy to play the main villain character.  Running a one shot like this is a LOT of effort in game as well as before.<br/><br/>Hope this helps to give you some ideas.  Use what you want and damn the rest!<br/><br/>The Golux                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425295/#Comment_425295" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-05T09:02:12+00:00" title="December  5, 2013  9:02AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't let Rob spoil your enthusiasm.

I'll take a look right away.<br/>Maybe part of the potential disconnect is whether I'm wanting a "freeform" or a "larp." I'm thinking freeform is a bit closer to what I had in mind; I'd like the players to co-craft the story line as well as their characters. This is a smallish type group. We'll meet in my basement. So far, I've got a werewolf, a pirate captain, a neonate vampire, and an undecided, with several more players probably/possibly coming.<br/><br/>My vision is to have people come as characters/types that interest them in particular, and have us work together to figure something out or make a plan or something. I'm definitely up for some intrigue between characters, but I was really envisioning a cooperative rather than competitive story line, thus, the off-stage villain-in-the-shadow approach. I want characters to be intrigued by each other, have some history perhaps (like I'm thinking the pirate and neonate vampire will have some history but like most relationships they don't see it the same way), but come together to work on a larger group goal that brings us together rather than ferreting out the rat, so to speak. <br/><br/>I'm definitely struggling with development, but I can't say I feel overwhelmed, I just feel excited and like things are coming together in their own time. This Event may need to be postponed until January, anyway, due to it being so close to the holidays folks are busy. Worst case scenario, which is more than 50% likely, I understand, the Event doesn't really come together all that well; but still, there will be food and alcohol, we will talk and meet like-minded others and plan for the future (hopefully), it will be fine. I'm planning to use a pre-written scenario for the next Event, and then I have an idea for another one I hope to write after that: a group of friends (some couples, some not) are traveling in a van at night, and it breaks down. They take shelter in an old hunting cabin with a fireplace. They begin bickering among themselves, issues between them get stirred up. But really what is going on, is there is a "monster" in the cave just outside the cabin (my basement, with players in the living room above). There will be weapons lying around. Players must decide what to do about the monster -- confront it or not, attack it, try to communicate with it. The monster will be a Grendel-type (from the book, not the Beowulf poem), lonely, damaged, wise, and actually not out to hurt the humans. The point is, do the humans attack without trying to understand, or do they benefit from the wisdom of the monster? I'm thinking of calling it "Broken" or something like that.<br/><br/>Here is a link to my meetup group if you want to take a look:  <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Chicagoland-Theater-of-the-Mind/" rel="nofollow">meetup.com/Chicagoland-Theater-of-the-Mind/</a><br/><br/>Thanks, Karen                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425313/#Comment_425313" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-05T12:46:05+00:00" title="December  5, 2013 12:46PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might also look at jeepform stuff, which is sorta/kinda LARP around a table, or LARP for a group of people in one room that doesn't break into separate simultaneous scenes.

But from a game design perspective, they're more like locked doors - things that need to be overcome to get to the answer.<br/><br/>It's good that you're thinking about player creativity and wanting them to have lots of input into where things go. But it's hard to be creative in a vacuum. So it's probably best to have a certain amount of planned structure that you can make use of. You can always decide to drop some or all of it on the fly if players come up with something better.<br/><br/>So you have initial information that you're giving to the players so that they can share it. Information about natural things dying or failing or whatever.<br/><br/>So brainstorm a list of places that the information they already had could lead. Things that would get them closer to the big bad guy. In particular, try to make these be things that actually feel like they are making progress - things that feel like they are hinting at who/what the villain is. Have several of these, and be prepared to implement various ones depending on how the players are going.<br/><br/>One way to structure it - no matter which thing they investigate first, they get Clue 1 out of it. Maybe Clue 1 is a letter with instructions to do some bad thing, signed vaguely (like with a single letter or something). So Clue 1 hints at what is coming, but doesn't really tell you what to do next. <br/><br/>So you randomly investigate one of the other initial pieces of information. This leads to Clue 2. Maybe Clue 2 is something a bit more specific. Maybe it's a matchbook for a bar. So now they have a specific direction.<br/><br/>So maybe when they get to the bar, someone approaches them and lets it be known that it has been noticed that they have been snooping around. So we start to have more of a direct threat.<br/><br/>And then at this point, you should come up with multiple ways that the players could push toward some sort of confrontation and conclusion with the villain.<br/><br/>Using this kind of a loose, flexible structure allows you to prepare some props in advance that guide the plot toward an interesting result, while still giving you tons of room to react to and involve the players in the creativity of the story.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Also, you could add in a physical puzzle for the players to work on solving. Those are often fun. And with a group of maybe 5 or so, it's not terribly hard to find something they can work on together.<br/><br/>An example for something like that - you could take a game like Perfection (also sold as Scramble), and hide the pieces around the basement. Once the players find all the pieces and put them in place, they have solved the puzzle. Maybe completing this will summon the villain to them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Golux" title="Golux"><img alt="Golux" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Golux">Golux</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425364/#Comment_425364" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-06T03:37:33+00:00" title="December  6, 2013  3:37AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>An example for something like that - you could take a game like Perfection (also sold as Scramble), and hide the pieces around the basement.

Characters enter, we discuss info about what each has heard is going on, and speculate on what might be happening. Food and wine is served (also soda and water will be available, and perhaps a variety of Mike's hard whatevers). Food will probably be roast chicken and vegetables (chicken/rabbit is all the wolves can find right now, no deer meat available). At some point, runes will be thrown, and/or stones with Wiccan alphabet letters will be found around the cave. (also, translation papers will be found). Rune message is something like "divisiveness, violence, bad omen". The wiccan stones will spell a particular name or value, not sure, and when players arrive at the correct de-scrambling of letters, a spirit will tell them they are creating their own bad omens and problems because they are too separate and divisive. They must work together for the sake of the entire Hidden World. We don't have to like each other or agree with each other all the time, but we MUST build an alliance among Others to survive the modern world effectively. Lame, huh?

Characters early came up with we should all work together to figure this problem out. Speculations included a disease or plague, a bad guy behind it all, or perhaps we were making mountains out of molehills and nothing too troubling was really going on.  After dinner, noise from outside cave ([I]effect of thunder tube[/I]) announced arrival of riddles on parchment, one for each participant. Each time a riddle was correctly solved, a flame in the cave would cast a fire ball up [I](effect of flash paper[/I]) and a stone would appear behind rock in cave. Stones had symbols on them, total of 7 stones, one for each riddle/player.  Symbols turned out to be witches\u2019 alphabet, and werewolf had translation paper ([I]crumpled up and a bit burnt on parchment paper[/I]) in the cave so characters could translate symbols to letters. Letters spelled out name Rodagon, and when one player held all stones and said Rodagon name, went into a trance ([I]NPC me at this time, with strobe light on me[/I]) and became Rodagon with a message for them. Rodagon message to characters was that supernatural energy was generated by free souls in the Ether , and too many humans were incarnating with souls so not enough free souls remained to generate supernatural energy or magic.  Rodagon did not incarnate since he had earned his way out of that cycle already.  Characters decided Rodagon was untrustworthy and was selfishly trying to avoid his responsibility in the cycle by being outside of the souls that could incarnate. They bound him via a short ceremony to have to incarnate, and would wait 20-30 years to see if this effort improved the troubling signs in the supernatural world or not.<br/><br/>Subplots (that mostly did not get enacted): Vampire A brought her new vampire B, who had past romantic relationship with Captain Key. Vampire B was to make sure that Captain knew Vampire A had been her maker.  Captain was to try and profit from conclave if possible. Vampire A was to talk with Captain Key about him supplying her clan with slaves; Captain Key was to find supplying humans for food repugnant, but slaves might be a different matter.  Nephilim had bought a remedy for supernatural flu from troll, for price of future favor. Troll was to discreetly remind Nephilim of payment, while Nephilim was to discreetly threaten troll to keep his mouth shut about it.<br/><br/>Perceived Positive Responses: most players seemed to have a reasonably good time, and to stay in character. The plot seemed to move along all right, and was resolved as stated above.<br/><br/>Perceived Negative Responses:  not quite enough players, needed 2-3 more players. And key player, Captain Key, was a no show/no explanation. My bad for casting him in such a major role without verifying for sure he was attending. One player made a couple of sharp comments to the point it was unclear if it was he or his character that was unhappy. Odd player showed, who clearly seemed somewhat MR or MI, but she played along to the best of her ability so no real complaints there, other than to watch out for players who may not be able to play more complex parts. One player, a assistant ST at a large-ish larp in the area, was great and very supportive, seemed to have a good time.  Another player, the HST at the same larp, seemed excited to be there at first but after an hour or so absolutely radiated (IMHO) \u201cthis is boring and beneath me\u201d and hurried her friends out the door after a brief discussion of evening. <br/><br/>Overall: I was somewhat pleased with my storyline, went to a lot of time/effort/expense to pull it together in terms of atmosphere and effects. I also felt I plotted it reasonably well, especially with the personal side plots. Unfortunately because Captain Key did not show, and because the LARP did not seem to break off into smaller groups at any point, these subplots really didn\u2019t get explored. I felt embarrassed and hurt that the HST person seemed so negative about the whole thing.<br/><br/>To do next: Do I still want to try these small parlor LARPS? Should I just get prewritten scenarios and not try to write my own at all? How to get players interested and committed to an evening? I have more of my own ideas I'd like to try, seeds of stories, but do I suck at storytelling? What to do? Worry, worry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426288/#Comment_426288" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-26T20:21:08+00:00" title="December 26, 2013  8:21PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No need to be embarrassed here! You designed a game and playtested it. Maybe it didn't go as well as expected. That's not uncommon in playtesting. People mostly had a good time, you say? Call that mostly a success then. Analyze your game, figure out what you might do to improve it next time, have more fun. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/><br/><br/>It'll probably be helpful to have some one-on-one discussions with players about the game, especially the ones you think were dissatisfied. If you have a preordained storyline and people are just playing through your story, then the question is what they bring to the table and if their choices during play matter at all. That /might/ be a source of the HST's boredom, but you'd need to talk to them to find out.<br/><br/>It can't /hurt/ to try some prewritten scenarios and run them to understand how they work. It's hard to understand how something works without actually playing it. <br/><br/>Oh, I don't know what a lot of your abbreviations stand for. HST? MR? MI? Can you clarify those? <br/><br/>Thanks for sharing!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL" title="RasmusL"><img alt="RasmusL" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL">RasmusL</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426293/#Comment_426293" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-27T01:32:33+00:00" title="December 27, 2013  1:32AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Congratulations on getting your first game going! It sounds really cool with the special effects and all and I really would love to play this game, plans on uploading it somewhere?<br/>I understand that you are not completely happy with the outcome and I recognize most of the problems that you point out from my own games. Below are what I try to keep in mind when I design a game:<br/><br/>*The players must know what do, their characters need clear goals and ways to work towards them. In many larps I as a player feel lost at the start of the game, not knowing what to do or how to do it. Giving my character an important and clear goal to strive towards helps alleviate this and I can ju,p straight into the action. How to give characters goal?:<br/> - Goals in the backstory. Doesn't get much more straight forward than this; just state the goals of the charater in his/her backstory.<br/> - Goals through outside interference. What happends during play threatens the character or creates an opportunity to act on. A bit more unreliable than putting stuff in the backstory and also more open to interpretation from the players.<br/> - Relationships as agendas. My favourite. For this I use a map of the relationships of the characters indicating characters with "dots" and relationships with "arrows connecting the dots". I divide possible relationships into three categories: "active", "reactive" and "passive". "Active" means that the relationship in itself creates a clear goal for the character (for example: "Loves and wants to marry") to work towards. "Reactive" is in itself not a goal but can be activated through what happends during play (for example "Wants to protect"). Passive relationships can often look like active or reactive ones but really gives nothing to play (for example "brother/sister of"). Passive relationships could be interpereted by the players into being active/reactive but I prefer not to gamble with that. On my relationship map I create triangles by drawing relationship arrows connecting the dots. I then fill out the relationships opting for at least one actve and one reactive relationship per triangle, always considering what could lead to dramatic conflict ("love triangles", etc). ((side note: active relationships can probably be divided into the three subcategories "wants possession of", "wants to destroy" and "wants to preserve" (this last one often lads in the reactive category though)))<br/><br/>Losing or achieving your goal can be very detrimental to play as it removes the characters'  raison d'etre. Make sure goals can not be achieved until the end or even not at all. <br/><br/>If you want characters to interact in smaller groups then you must give them strong incentives to do so. Playing in smaller groups is scary as it outs more focus on the individual players and getting a group to separate can be problematic (this has happened to me more than once when I added content that was only useful in smaller groups but no incentives to split up). Create strong goals aimed at this.<br/><br/>Those are the things i try to keep in mind.<br/><br/>Also, as you may already have done, if you want your players to be part of creating the "story" then tell them that beforehand to prevent situations where players are just waiting for the "next event" and just being reactive instead of taking the initiative and pursuing their own agendas.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wannaplaypretend" title="wannaplaypretend"><img alt="wannaplaypretend" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wannaplaypretend">wannaplaypretend</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426317/#Comment_426317" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-27T12:29:13+00:00" title="December 27, 2013 12:29PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 27, 2013 12:31PM by wannaplaypretend.">edited December 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Adam">@Adam</a>: Thanks for the support. Sorry, HST=Head Story Teller, I had to look that one up myself, it was how the player wrote about herself on my group, with initials and all. MR=Mental Retardation, MI=Mental Illness. I'm not really up for talking to the HST one-on-one, she was so rejecting and condescending.<br/><a href="/forums/profile/RasmusL">@RasmusL</a>: Thanks for the support. Thanks for the feedback and ideas, they are very helpful! Good idea about active/reactive/passive and drawing triangles between various characters. Very helpful.<br/><br/>I actually tried to avoid dictating the story too much. I gave what I thought was enough backstory for each character (minus the woodland elf, which was good because she was the MI/MR player) to pursue things on their own, even gave them each a couple of explicit objectives. I also told them what to expect and what was to happen when they got to the conclave ahead of time, via email. I was trying to straddle a balance between allowing room to co-create the story, and giving players some direction and some things to do/happen. Maybe I erred too much on the making things happen side? I kept getting forum feedback (here and rpg.net) that more had to happen than just the story, but then the HST player really did not seem to like the plot devices I introduced. She was just rejecting and condescending in general, in my opinion. I really liked my flash paper effect and she was very "oh...flash paper" about it. Any ideas how to deal with various personalities in LARP players? Such as the larp queen, the know-it-all, etc? Part of what seemed to happen is that players neglected to really read their character backstory sheet ahead of time very thoroughly (and they weren't long!), that gave them backstory, objectives, and relationships with other characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL" title="RasmusL"><img alt="RasmusL" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL">RasmusL</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426322/#Comment_426322" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-27T15:22:49+00:00" title="December 27, 2013  3:22PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dealing with tricky players: I don't know and I have given up. I try to build an argument based on different playstyles (like the creative agendas and other models dealing with the hows and whys of different playstyles and players) but in the end it usuaally comes down to me picking out the players I like and rejecting the ones I don't like. I have the luxury to be able to play with people I know play the same "game" but getting to that point can be tiresome (I find it hard to reconcile the requirement of my hobby to be fun and the fact that I some times tell people that they can't come play because they ruin the game, it makes me feel like a jerk but I have found no better way). But I guess you found some nice players during the game? Perhaps they will have friends that are of at least a similar mindset/social culture? <br/>In an ideal world these kinds of differences could probably be sorted out before the game by discussing the social contract (what goes and what doesn't, how we play and what we want to achieve, etc) but personaly I fail over and over again and of the new players I play with probably 50-70% eithere leave on their own behalf or are politely asked to find another group to play with. It may sound harsch but so far I have found no better solution that maximizes the fun of all participants.<br/><br/>I find this strange but apparently people don't read even the shortest and most important texts unless they are forced to. I find that doing workshops before the game that focus on the important aspects and information are a great tool to make sure that everyone has enough information. There are many good exercises for such workshops but an easy one could be letting the players have their printed character backround/description as support, being divided into small groups/pairs and do small exercises like introductions, briefly discussing their common past, make up a common plot aimed at another player, etc. This forces them to build on (and therefore read) the information on their printed description/backstory. I love workshops and I never trust a player to read anything (kinda sad actually. Is it because they do not respect me or my games enough? I actually don't know, but I do know they keep showing up so I must be doing something right).<br/><br/>Probably this is all pretty basic stuff for you but perhaps it will provide at least some inspiration or beginnings of ideas for how to develop your game.
