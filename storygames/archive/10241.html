I'll break up my answers into a couple of posts for readability...<br/><br/><b>[1] Why is it called "Dirty Hands"?</b><br/>When talking to Paul, I dunno a year ago or so, I kept talking about getting your hands dirty in play. I think he jokingly suggested Your Dirty Hands. Either way I liked the notion that in the game you are getting your hands dirty in play and the game is about people who get their hands dirty for something they believe in.<br/><br/><b>[2] For those who have never played or heard of the other two versions, what's the game about in brief?</b><br/>I think the new introduction says it best:\n<blockquote><em>Conspiracy of Shadows: Dirty Hands</em> is a game about taking a stand. It is about confronting something larger than yourself and saying "no further."</blockquote>\n<b>[3] Why did you take this Open Source move in the new edition?</b><br/>A bunch of long winded reasons. I'll give a bunch bullet points in short, each of which I could talk ad nauseum about:\n<ul><li>I firmly believe games should be living documents, not static texts. The idea of others contributing to it via a community is appealing to me (hence the Drupal build I am slowly developing).</li>\n<li>I am not interested in publishing "game" texts as physical artifacts.</li>\n<li>I like the idea that the text could live on somewhere else if people were so inclined, preferably evolved into something else.</li>\n<li>It is fucking easier to craft something I love this way.</li>\n<li>I would rather focus my physical publications efforts to more art oriented projects (like the hand-made book I am working on in my very spare time).</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227585/#Comment_227585" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T11:04:00+00:00" title="August 25, 2009 11:04AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part Deux<br/><b>[4] So this is effectively the third edition of the game. What were lessons you learned from the first edition? (Good and Bad, but primarily good)</b><br/>The first edition taught me a bunch of stuff:\n<ul><li>It taught me a lot of basics in writing a game.</li>\n<li>It taught me the importance of expanding your feedback circle.</li>\n<li>It got me thinking in terms of user interface with the text over my perceptions of what user interface should be.</li>\n<li>It taught a lot about how small my audience really is.</li></ul>\nI missed a bunch of lessons, but I learned them later... And some of them were painful...<br/><br/><b>[5] Lessons learned from the second edition? (Good and Bad, but primarily good)</b><br/>The second edition experience really sucked in a lot of ways:\n<ul><li>I learned that I need to listen to myself more than other people when it comes to designing my games. I do it with everything else, why the fuck did I not do it with the game... Cause I am idiot.</li>\n<li>I learned not to expect ANYTHING from the indie community.</li>\n<li>I learned that how-to guides on playing are woefully lacking in games, that writing them is hard, but damn necessary.</li>\n<li>I learned my artistic limits in regards to game design.</li>\n<li>I learned that sometimes you need to cut out those good ideas to make a great game (which I didn't do).</li></ul>\n<b>[6] Why did you rename/change up all the Eastern European countries, rather than simply fictionalize them (adding magic, etc)?  (I think the opportunity is there to get folks interested in the history of the countries under the veil, but with the renames/changes it removes that a bit; kinda like L5R. Opinion?)</b><br/>So I am a retarded history nut. I am obsessive with knowing as much as I can about any subject, but history has always been the number one thing for me. At the same time I wasn't interested in creating a game set in history for a couple of reasons.<br/><br/>For one, I wanted the creative freedom to make something my own. Sure, the setting started as serial numbers filed off, but over time it changed. They became their own thing, with their own anthropology. And in doing so, I taught myself how to avoid setting dump but still create the atmosphere I wanted.<br/><br/>I also find that in a game where players have the control to create setting as you go, it is harder to claim event X occured without it always being a secret history (ala WoD) where no one knew about it. I hate that shit. I hate the Templar's gold and the Masons, and all that pseudo-history crap that they sell in Barnes &amp; Noble as history. I wanted none of that in the game. I wanted people who play it to have the freedom to build what they wanted using the tools I provided.<br/><br/>As this thing has gone on, I have found that I don't give a fuck if people don't like the setting. I have gotten feedback asking me things like "why wouldn't I just play in medieval Europe" or that the setting is "lame." My response to the former, is "do what you gotta do" and to the latter, "fuck off and go back to sucking JRR's cock."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227588/#Comment_227588" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T11:21:05+00:00" title="August 25, 2009 11:21AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>[7] You've posted here and there about playtesting the new edition.

Everything integrates. There is no waste. No hanging chads in the mechanics. It does what I always envisioned the game doing in regards to play at the table. The previous editions did it in part, but were designed in a sort of piece-meal fashion... for a lot of reasons.<br/><br/>The strengths of the game:\n<ul><li>It captures the kinetic feel of the back and forth I want in conflicts.</li>\n<li>It provides a means for creating an entire long-form game with clear guidelines on how to do it.</li>\n<li>It addresses in-play issues that tend to get hand waved in most game texts.</li>\n<li>It focuses character creation that makes hooking everything together simple.</li>\n<li>It is a long-form game that has minimal prep requirements for the game master.</li>\n<li>It fosters investment in the setting and fiction of the game.</li>\n<li>It cleanly mixes the elements I love about it's various inspirations.</li></ul>\n<b>[8] What's something cool that happened in one of your games, in brief?</b><br/>I think the coolest thing I have seen happen with the game is a kind of technical thing. When we created the theme and the characters and the cell, we were able to hit the ground running and keep running. The keep running is the important part. My game group is a bunch of very busy guys and we often go on long hiatus. However it was easy to pick up where we left because all the pieces are very clearly labeled and all the hooks between the various elements are very clear. My experiences with programming I think helped in that regard.<br/><br/><b>[9] How come you don't reuse the awesome 1e cover? Personally, I think it's a great cover.</b><br/>It is a great piece. My friend Pat, who is a pretty successful illustrator in the industry, did that for me for a song, and I will be forever grateful to him. However, I decided with the 2nd Edition and I still agree with this, that it is really, really important that the art is consistent throughout. It isn't about the art in isolation, but about what it does to convey the ideas and atmosphere of the text. Plus I am a fucking ego maniac...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227598/#Comment_227598" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T11:49:00+00:00" title="August 25, 2009 11:49AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Follow-up question:<br/><br/>Can you elaborate on how you prep a campaign from session to session?

I kinda imply it. I am going to have to make sure that is added to the text. Your question illustrates perfectly shit I mentioned above...<br/><br/>But to answer your question, the game is broken down into what I call <em>sessions</em>. A session is kinda like a TV storyline. Sometimes it is resolved in one episode, and sometimes it takes a few. If you are between sessions, you work up the next session. If you are in the middle of a session you tweak the current session as necessary based on the events of play. I probably should choose a different word to define it, but haven't found one I like better yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230205/#Comment_230205" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-05T10:48:34+00:00" title="September  5, 2009 10:48AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ken Sentowski!</cite><br/>I learned not to expect ANYTHING from the indie community.</blockquote>\nAye Keith, what is this one about?

Don't expect ANYTHING from the indie community. It is a lot of smoke and little fire. Rely on relationships with people you know outside the online noise machine. Expecting anything from people that have no vested interest in you and/or your success is stupid. It is easy to lose sight of that.<br/><br/>Brand - Just when I think I can't love/hate you more, you make me love/hate you more. The Rules part is done. Features role out as I finish them.
