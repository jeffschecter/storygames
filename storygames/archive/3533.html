Despite the fact that it was "mandatory fun," it actually became a fairly engaging experience.  Part of the game became quickly passing up answers from the back of group to the where they could be heard  by the scorekeeper over all the shouting.  It was maybe a slightly different sort of fun than if I had played the same game with a more intimate group, but it was fun nonetheless.<br/><br/>Even on the more intimate side of things, though, whenever my entire extended family comes over for Christmas or Thanksgiving or the summer reunion, we usually end up with at <i>least</i> 10 people who want to play games at night.  There are a lot of mainstream games (usually team-based) which can accommodate this sort of thing: Trivial Pursuit, Scattergories, Outburst, Pictionary, Taboo, etc.<br/><br/>We buy such games <i>despite</i> the fact that its nearly impossible to organize huge family meetings more than 3 times a year.  We buy them because when we do finally get a chance to play them as a very, very large group, it's so much fun that the games were generally well worth the cost and the wait.<br/><br/>Now, from lurking on these forums for a while, I get the idea that avid story-gamers tend to meet each other at conventions even more often than my family gets together for holidays.  And although you don't know each other as well as I know my family, you probably do know each other better than I knew most of the 30-40 coworkers I played Outburst with.  So I suspect that if a <i>fun</i> storygame were made with very, very large groups in mind, it could potentially be worthwhile despite group organizational issues.  It might even pass as more mainstream for your own non-storygaming friends and families than a game intentionally designed for 2-6 players.  I know it's a lot easier to get my extended family to play Taboo than it is to get them to play Monopoly.<br/><br/>So, to turn this into a design discussion, suppose a storygame were designed with the idea that it would not necessarily be played more than once, ever, by a single group, but that one session/instance should provide the most possible fun for the <i>most people</i>.  What principles could guide the design of this hypothetical game to maximize its value as a storygame and as a game for a very, very large group?<br/><br/>Another aspect of this discussion could be about what limitations could exist.  Surely, for example, there would be a point where there would simply be too many players for the game mechanics to handle cohesively (as a single game session/instance).  Or is that necessarily the case?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79646/#Comment_79646" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-05T12:19:17+00:00" title="July  5, 2007 12:19PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could learn a lot from LARPs, this issue has been worked on and largely solved there for decades.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79653/#Comment_79653" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-05T12:40:15+00:00" title="July  5, 2007 12:40PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason is correct.
