How does the system mould the play experience? And more importantly, how can I modify a system to more consistently get a type of gameplay I am looking for?<br/><br/>I guess I might be treading on thin ice here, as I'm sure there are strong opinions on this type of thing, but from reading a lot of different systems, and playing a number of them, I've seen some radically different play experiences come out - and even in board games the different mechanics of the games can have effects on how the players act - and more tellingly the order of games played tends to have an overlapping effect. (Playing Battlestar galactica, or pandemic first, changes how we play munchkin next... Etc)<br/><br/>From what I gather, how a player interacts with a game, shapes their thinking about the game (almost like language theory, where structure of a language shapes the culture using it). So my belief is that how a complete cycle of interaction plays out strongly influences how a player will make following choices.<br/><br/>So what am I talking about when I say 'interaction'. When a player makes a choice, that choice is mechanically played out against the fiction, then the player gets feedback from that informs the next choice. So that feedback - how much and how often and how quickly - is part of what drives the player. <br/><br/>I say part of, because there are more things that are important - like does the player value character growth, fictional changes, winning, being in spotlight etc..<br/><br/>Anyway, enough theory, onto problem: I have a strong problem in my current group where they often state feeling aimless - and have stated that they will just follow with the group, which tends to mean the player who is most vocal/active. The basic way I've been running the game is that the whatever the players has said they are interested in, and have placed as their character's motivation, tends to get more spotlight. Because we have a demonhunter, demons keep showing up. A doctor/necromancer means people getting injured and plagues to cure. A wilderness survivor means travelling through harsh/dangerous country etc. the problem comes when the player doesn't necessarily know what they want to do, and in the system there is no mechanical incentive for this motivation. So the feedback is very slow and indirect.<br/><br/>Of course, adding to the problem is that I have a large group, so it's only possible to highlight 1 or 2 things in a session, so if the current story doesn't fit the wants of the player, they might have to wait a few sessions before it does...<br/><br/>But even so, I get 4-6 people showing up every week and asking for more sessions, as they enjoy some of the stuff - especially when they get an opportunity for their character to roll lots of dice (dice pool mechanics) as they can try to do epic stuff (things so hard that you can only suceed with huge dice pools) and look cool doing it. This often ties with the motivation I. That character skill probably has some overlap with player wants.<br/><br/>But another reason players turn up, yet feel unsatisified, might be the way I'm handling character advancement. I use a collective pool of xp that are divided up at the end of the session - xp given for 'being outmatched' ie, going against harder situation than you feel safe, 'getting into trouble' acting pulpy and doing stuff that you know isn't the best idea, and 'testing ideas' where you get an idea and see if things work like that...<br/>But I am the one that puts the XP into the pot all the time, so I'm not 100% sure all the players realise exactly what is going on, but even if their character did noting all session, they will get some xp... A I think the end feedback i am giving is just "show up as often as you can, and act like a character in a pulp story" which is not necessarily all bad, but not completely satisfying.<br/><br/>Ummm.. Ok, lost my train of thought there. Basically I want to get my players more excited about their characters, and pulsing their in-character motivations and personality more....<br/><br/>Sigh. I did go on.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437690/#Comment_437690" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-25T00:30:32+00:00" title="August 25, 2014 12:30AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right that there are some strong opinions about this. Me and Rickard (the anti-fanmail crowd) don't much like encouraging behavior through mechanical rewards. So here are the two things that come to my mind when I read this.<br/><br/>1: Make sure the characters have strong motivations. They should have goals that they strive for and feel passionate about. That should help with the aimlessness.<br/>2: Step up the social rewards. Whenever someone does something cool, say "Whoah! Awesome!" and show your appreciation and encouragement. Rather than (or as a complement to) relying on XP to mould the behavior you want, use social rewards by verbal and nonverbal appreciation, and taking the stuff they do and make up and make it important.<br/>2b: Be careful about negative feedback, but you can sometimes suggest alternatives or ask "You sure?" when people do things that aren't "pulpy". But remember that when people's tastes differ from yours you should respect that. Encourage things that THEY think are awesome, to make sure they deliver their A-game. And then take contribute with your own vision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437691/#Comment_437691" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-25T02:14:07+00:00" title="August 25, 2014  2:14AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very true.

PC death is a good one, but if that's too much for your group, threaten some NPC or aspect of the world they all care about. If they don't care enough about any of that stuff right now, you need to find ways to make them care about it, then threaten it. If the players feel like the fate of their characters -- or any part of a setting to which they are attached -- is at stake, they will become more invested. Collaborative world-building is a great way to build this investment from the outset. It's a bit harder to get them invested when it's all stuff created on the GM side, especially if it's taken from pre-published material. The <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> way to get players to care about the world is to let them have a say in the creation of that world.<br/><br/>I would try thinking less in terms of individual character goals and more in terms of collective goals and dynamics, or ways of tying individual character goals directly and dramatically into the group. If the demon hunter hunts demons, have one of his fellow PCs (choose carefully) become possessed, and let the possessed character roleplay it to the hilt. If the necromancer/doctor is supposed to cure plagues, have everyone in the party fall prey to a terrible plague with a hard countdown. Find ways to create intra-party motivation, instead of "Hey, everybody, this week we're all helping the demon hunter track down a demon."<br/><br/>Think about going big. Introduce a major threat that, unchecked, will alter the world irrevocably and for the worse. Destroy what they care about. Instill the desire for revenge; put them in a spot where to stand firm will mean certain annihilation; make them run for their lives.<br/><br/>Also, it may be a non-issue, but sometimes there's a difference between what a character wants to do based on class and and what a player wants, so you might take a look at that. Your examples of demon hunter, necromancer, and survivor describe activities to which those classes are suited, but players often have motivations beyond their class description. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_Test" rel="nofollow">Bartle Quotient</a>  of Socializer/Explorer/Achiever/Killer may have issues, but it (or other personality tests) can help you think about the psychology of your players. I wouldn't ask anyone to take a test, I would just use the idea of personality types as a lens through which to think about player behavior and motivation. The choice of character class is often a great indicator of who wants what --odds are your demon hunter is a Killer, your necromancer/doctor is an Achiever, and your survivor is an Explorer -- but sometimes those things don't line up neatly, and it can be worth examining.<br/><br/>One small thing I do to encourage investment is give out "boon tokens" whenever someone does a "Whoah! Awesome!" thing like Simon describes. They can spend the tokens to roll extra dice, and the tokens don't carry over from session to session. It's more to encourage roleplaying and creative thinking, but it does give people a charge. I make it clear that I give out the tokens at my own whim, and that I won't give them out to anyone who is obviously trying to game the mechanic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes" title="Jason_Lutes"><img alt="Jason_Lutes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes">Jason_Lutes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437698/#Comment_437698" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-25T06:56:37+00:00" title="August 25, 2014  6:56AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, and I really like Dungeon World's approach to XP -- individual awards for doing stuff based on alignment and bonds, but group awards for defeating notable enemies, finding memorable loot, and discovering new things about the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437699/#Comment_437699" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-25T07:23:36+00:00" title="August 25, 2014  7:23AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2014 4:09PM by Rickard.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want to make a game about grinding, then go ahead.

Pay especially attention to how you get loot, how important that loot is, what the restriction is for the more important loot. The game also got login rewards and rewards for coming back after a certain time. I'm playing it myself and got two classes at level 60 and one at level 40. The game isn't that fun anymore in means of challenges, but I still play it. Why? I know about the effects of the Skinner Box (or "operant conditioning" - Skinner himself didn't like the term "Skinner box") but I <i>still</i> fall for that powerful trap. I asked my guilders why they play the game, and they answered "To get better equipment". Why? They are at a certain level that they can just walk through any map and the monsters will die instantly.<br/><br/>I personally like when game design makes a task autotelic; when doing a task serves it's own purpose; when a task in itself is fun doing.  <a href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes">@Jason_Lutes</a> talked about player types, and I agree with that thinking. You should attract the right audience for your game. That's why I'm talking about the WHYs in my own <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/433053#Comment_433053" rel="nofollow">Theory of Engagement</a>. If you ever played a game and then asked yourself "Why did I do that?" and the answer was "To get a reward", then you know what I'm talking about. The time you spent on the task was meaningless. It was the reward you were after. <br/><br/>Operant conditioning is combined with our drive to make things as efficient as possible. That's why I wanted to play Kingsroad to begin with. To see how fast I could advance to level 60 (and also, add "playing MMO" to my list of my game design experience). Rewards can be used to give a good pointer what the game is about. To show other people different ways of playing. I know examples where the players started to describe the environment just because they could spend point on it, but it could as easily be that they got a reward for it instead. "Give praise and get 2 XP" is another example. But would they then do it because of the fun of it or because of the reward?<br/><br/>[edit] Added more stuff to each paragraph.

That is, if everyone pays attention to my Pick Locks roll, and a success gets me into the safe, you can bet I will repeat the behavior of rolling my Pick Locks skill.<br/><br/>Judging by your report of aimless players, I think this is one of your two primary options for a fix.  That is: use a system that produces results that people care about.  If getting into the safe or not getting into the safe is compelling to your group, "roll Pick Locks" is a good system component.  If, on the other hand, your group cares about other types of developments -- changing relationships, unfolding plot, personal quest advancement, or whatever -- then a system focused on whatever they're into would be better.  "Roll for what no one cares about" is a huge buzz kill.  How do you think your game is doing on this front?<br/><br/>The second primary option for a fix is to do some pre-play work on goals.  Elicit from the players what they're interested in, the best- and worst-case scenarios they can envision for their endeavors, etc.  If they're drawing a blank, then they need new inspiration -- either from you or from some outside material.  You could ask them what movie genre they want the game to be like, then ask them their favorite movies from that genre, and then draw inspiration from that.  You might need to make new characters.  I've seen all this stuff work at the beginning of a campaign, but I've never tried it in the middle.  <br/><br/>Anyway, once everyone's inspired, then you can go back to GMing with an eye toward character interests and it'll actually work this time, because you'll be going from stated goals like "leave the rough wilderness life behind" rather than job descriptions like "wilderness survivor".  I think a job description is only interesting when played off against other characters and situations which complicate it.  "Look at me, I'm a wilderness survivor" is only fun for a few scenes, in my experience -- after that, I need to get hit with questions like "can you still survive in this wilderness?" or "are you still a wilderness survivor now that you're offered riches to move to the city?" or something.  Tackling stuff like that might take a session or two to build momentum, but once it does, the players usually wind up with some preferences strong enough to motivate action.<br/><br/>If the players can express what they're excited about, but still can't come up with goals, then one option is for you to take the stuff they're excited about and use it to introduce dramatic situations they can't ignore.  "Deal with this important crisis" then becomes their goal.<br/><br/>If you want recommendations of games that handle particular parts of this, just let me know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437773/#Comment_437773" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T07:29:05+00:00" title="August 26, 2014  7:29AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good post, David.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437815/#Comment_437815" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T19:25:26+00:00" title="August 26, 2014  7:25PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's very easy for games to become aimless and meandering; one of the major reasons I, personally, am in the pro "mechanical rewards for doing stuff" camp is not because I think MMO-style Operant Conditioning functions in RPGs, but because tabletop RPGs often benefit from a method of keeping us all on the same page. It's like, "Are we doing that thing we all agreed we wanted to do? Oh, yep, we are, because the Fate Points / Fan Mail / Artha / etc is flowing." If it stops flowing, then it's time to re-examine what's going on, again, not in order to get people their fix, but just to make sure we're all still interested in the game's premise and stuff like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437819/#Comment_437819" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T21:46:03+00:00" title="August 26, 2014  9:46PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            yes, very good.. Lets see if I can answer this <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>I dont think its the first one. whenever the players are rlling for stuff, its because they are eager to have the dice decide something - Its pretty much - "hey, i want to try to do X, can i roll to see if i can do that" where X is something like "convince the merchant I am the best around" or "seduce the noble" or "make the enemy so impressed they hesitate to raise their swords against me". Pretty much always player initiated and derives from the fiction - and usually results in changing the direction of the story. <br/>Whenever the players are rolling they are excited and tend to be fairly driven.<br/><br/>The challenge comes that its not always everyone involved. We have a LARGE group of players. ), although we usually only have 3-6 attending any particular session. The issue is more the 2nd issue - and some other things....<br/><br/>1 player tends to be very very involved - always talking to me about things that could possibly add complication and trouble for his character. There are another couple of players who are also forward, and send mails or chats about things they would like to encounter or do in the game. The other 6 though tend to be much more reactive - when stuff happens ingame they latch on and start trying to solve those problems. A few of them dont seem to know what their character is/wants and they are the main players who say they are feeling aimless/unsatisfied/just want to do some stuff.<br/><br/>This was sortof ok, until our recent session where a major problem/plot was resolved (being hunted by evil empire assassins, who were cleverly fooled into thinking the PCs are dead, and have now left, thinking their assassinations successful). A few players (2 specifically) want to leave the land they have had 50 sessions in, abandoning all the people who are still in danger from other threats because they didn't rise up to help the PCs against the assassins... while there are another couple who desperately want to stay to protect their investments (NPC dependents, allies, businesses). The rest are undecided/dont care/dont want to take sides.<br/><br/>I've been mailing and chatting with as many players as I can - even bluntly asked on the mailing list where the group wants to go next - Thats fairly normal as I've never had a plot but built the game from the character's backgrounds and actions in game. But this time there are a lot of people who say they dont know what their character's aims are.. and those that do know are at total opposite ends...<br/><br/>I was asking about molding the game, as when the player actually interact with the rules (building dice pool to decide a fictional outcome) they are driven, and seem to love getting the XP to add more things to their sheet - or even go forth and risk things on their sheet. So I was wondering if making motivations more mechanically important would make some difference. Maybe making playing to their motivation give them more bonuses, or give XP for scenes progressing towards motivation or .. something...<br/><br/>sigh.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437821/#Comment_437821" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-26T23:28:41+00:00" title="August 26, 2014 11:28PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.

In those cases, I prefer to honor the fiction.  Let those two characters have their genuine reaction to the people not supporting them.  If it means they leave, then they leave, and those two players make new characters, with the old ones having left the scope of play.<br/><br/>(Or, you could change the game so it alternates scenes between some characters in one place and others in another, but I'm guessing that's not feasible logistically.)<br/><br/>I think I'd give the characters who want to leave an offer.  They're approached by enemies of the land, who say, "We're going to conquer these people, and we hear you're mad at them, so join us!"  Make it clear that these conquerors are too tough for these players to defeat on their own.  Then give them the following options:<br/>1) Your characters join the conquerors.  We'll see them again when the conflict begins.  In the meantime, if you want to play with the party, make new characters.<br/>2) Your characters want to stop these conquerors, so they return home to rally the rest of the party against them.  (If this is your preferred option, make the conquerors really despicable!)<br/>3) Your characters don't want any part of this situation, and move on to parts unknown.  The end.  If you want to play with the party, make new characters.<br/><br/>Another idea would be to invent some way for the dissenting characters to stick around but also exact revenge on the people who didn't support them.  Recruit them as cannonfodder, requisition their stuff, tax them, frame them for crimes, whatever.  If the rest of the party isn't amenable, then present them with secret options, like draining the people's life energy at night to restore lost hit points or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437823/#Comment_437823" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-27T00:02:24+00:00" title="August 27, 2014 12:02AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But this time there are a lot of people who say they dont know what their character's aims are.. and those that do know are at total opposite ends...</blockquote>\nI see that a lot in games with people who are unfamiliar with or unenthusiastic about a particular genre or setting (and have been one of those people myself). If you don't know what makes a good goal for that game or what kinds of things you should be doing, you tend to sit back and wait for direction. Especially if other people at the table don't seem to be having the same problem; you can just get carried along by the GM's plans or the plans of other players.<br/><br/>Also, the more that the GM stresses how important it is for you to come up with goals for your character, the harder it gets to think of one. <br/><br/><br/>So, here's a suggestion for a nice thing you could do for your players who are having a particularly difficult time answering your question: offer them a menu. Come up with 2 to 4 ideas for aims that you think they might like their characters to be interested in (ones that avoid the obvious problems like taking their character out of the game, hopefully), and ask them to pick one. Then refine it as necessary by having them pick another option from another short list of possibilities, until both of you feel like you've got enough information to work with. Hopefully the combination of personal attention and having a simple, straightforward decision to make (A or B or C) will get them engaged in ways that just letting them flounder in the middle of a big group hasn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437880/#Comment_437880" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-28T11:51:25+00:00" title="August 28, 2014 11:51AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know - thanks for the comments!
