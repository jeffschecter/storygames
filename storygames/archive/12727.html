Cultural experience in the human body goal 5: Look at the New World ... ...."<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a translation from the site conveythis.com... it really got me thinking. I think the translation at the end sounds awesome and compelling, and I love how it makes no sense, really (Space boundary conditions? goal 5?) but it makes my mind really want to make sense out of it. I was wondering if there would be a way to get at that wacky fun that comes from bad translations of movies/anime that makes them both ridiculous and ironically poetic/compelling (at least to the uninitiated viewer I was when I first saw those bad dubs!) in an RPG.

The central mechanic is that everything you say is true even if it contradicts everything else in the story. People are free to ignore it or adjust and the lies will compound with the lies so different characters have vastly different plots in the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286282/#Comment_286282" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-14T06:49:40+00:00" title="August 14, 2010  6:49AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, but how...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286319/#Comment_286319" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-14T10:30:12+00:00" title="August 14, 2010 10:30AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2010 11:18AM by Andy.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, having lived and taught in Japan, I saw this all the goddamned time. At first (as I was becoming accultured) I was "angry" that "they were dirtying my mother tongue", when it was clear that all anyone had to do was ask ANYONE around them for help/a closer look, and would have gotten help for free.<br/><br/>Then I accepted it.<br/><br/>Then I became enamored with it. Especially when combined with cultural strangeness. See<b> Metal Wolf Chaos</b> for refrence:<br/><b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Genl242_ZU8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Genl242_ZU8</a></b><br/><br/>Based on that, my enamoration/acceptance of using English as "cool decoration"/the attitude of "I know English, so I'll just write, and won't have a native check my docs or anything", and a conversation with Jerry Greyson (where all ridiculous awesome seems to spring these days), I wrote such a game.<br/><br/>The rules are not complete, it's pretty much a draft. I wrote it for Game Chef a few years back. It was a "licensed RPG" based off of a fictional video game license (in the vein of Metal Wolf Chaos, Armored Core or actually more accurately, the otaku-loved "<b>GUNPARADE MARCH</b>" series that never quite made it to the US.<br/><br/>I wrote it carefully, with a satirical pen dipped in real love for this kind of thing, only making "Japanese" English grammatical mistakes (and not just "fucking it up to make it look /foreign/": I was in fact very careful with the exact grammar usage and inconsistencies; sentence fragments, run-on sentences, pluralization, passive voice, etc etc etc).<br/><br/>Anyway, here it is: <b>Take Back of Freedom: FIRE CHRONICLE</b>.<br/><br/><b><a href="http://www.robo-christ.com/rpg/TBOF.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.robo-christ.com/rpg/TBOF.pdf</a></b><br/><br/>If anyone wants to take it and give it a system (or just use Mechaton), go for it.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/><b>EDIT:</b> I just reread this document (haven't cracked it for like 2+ years), and it lit a fire. When I'm done with Tenra, I'll have to take another look at this. It's got legs, just not in the original rules system I imagined.
