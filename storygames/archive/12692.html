If I left someone out by mistake, or if you weren't part of the playtest already but want to join in, let me know and I'll send you the download link.<br/><br/>Hopefully calling it the "final" playtest round won't jinx it. We've been playing this version locally for a few months already, and the feedback has been very good (at GPNW 2010 and elsewhere). We'll see if it withstands the slings and arrows of a larger playtest.<br/><br/>And in case you're reading this and saying "Wait, what the heck is Microscope?":\n<blockquote>Mankind spreads to the stars and founds a galactic civilization. A brilliant general conquers the world and dies young, leaving behind a fractured empire. An ancient line of dragon-kings die out as magic fades from the realm.<br/> <br/>Those are all examples of Microscope games.<br/> <br/>Microscope is a roleplaying game, but you don\u2019t have your own character. You don\u2019t play in chronological order. You know how things end before you know why they really happened. Yeah, it\u2019s a bit experimental.<br/> <br/>You start with the big picture, the grand scheme of your history, then zoom in and explore all the nooks and crannies. The more you play, the more complex the history becomes. Your once simple summary becomes a detailed tapestry, full of meaning and surprises. It\u2019s fractal gaming.<br/> <br/>Want to leap a thousand years in the future and see how an institution shaped society? Want to jump back to the childhood of the king you just saw assassinated and find out what made him such a hated ruler? That\u2019s normal play in Microscope. You have the freedom to move around and examine whatever you want, defying limits of time and space.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nocker" title="Nocker"><img alt="Nocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://sites.google.com/site/angrynocker/_/rsrc/1306682518924/jdr/images.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nocker">Nocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285119/#Comment_285119" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-10T06:45:55+00:00" title="August 10, 2010  6:45AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds great !

I appreciate the interest, but right now I'm only looking for people who'll be able to play the game -- I need to see how the text delivers, not just how it reads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
