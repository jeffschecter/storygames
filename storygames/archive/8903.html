We cooked fantastic meals, drank expensive liquor and watched interesting films (e.g. Fog of War, Catch-22, 2010: The Year We Make Contact).<br/><br/>One of the other things we did was play a game of Shock:.  My friend Dean was an old gamer buddy from high school, and Carole had dabbled a bit with some board games and a few more traditional RPG, but neither had played any of these new-fangled "story" games.  We took an entire Saturday to play, leisurely brainstorming our Shock, Issues and Minutiae.  Actual game play was spread out over the afternoon and evening, punctuated by an awesome collaboratively-created dinner.  <br/><br/>The game was fantastic, which is my default experience for Shock:.  Dean and Carole asked me to post our after action report for comment, so here it is.  <br/><br/>Warning:  It's somewhat long...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_196739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros" title="Maedhros"><img alt="Maedhros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros">Maedhros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196739/#Comment_196739" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T20:46:41+00:00" title="March 12, 2009  8:46PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS 2116</b><br/><br/><br/><b>SHOCK:</b>\tEffective immortality is possible, by means of a \u201cpersonality upload\u201d to a computer database.<br/><br/><b>ISSUES:\t</b><br/><br/>\xb7\tExtreme Inequality (Wealth):  Owned by Dean<br/>\xb7\tGovernance: Owned by Carole<br/>\xb7\tCrime and Punishment: Owned by David <br/><br/><b>MINUTIAE:</b><br/><br/>1.  The year is 2116 AD<br/><br/>2.  There was a worldwide viral outbreak a little over 100 years ago that killed over 95% of the Earth\u2019s population.  The virus was a particularly potent retrovirus that effectively merged itself with the DNA of the survivors and all of their descendents.  Some people are born with disfigurements of varying intensity.  All people, rich and poor alike, are vulnerable to these birth defects.  Plants and animals were also affected, some in very dangerous ways (e.g. large, deadly housecats).<br/><br/>3.  On Earth, the remaining population has rebuilt a few small communities.  A number of nomadic bands exist, both aggressive and otherwise.  The economy is quasi-feudal; control of arable land capable of producing food is the measure of wealth.<br/><br/>4.  Living on Earth is hard, hard work \u2013 even for those in communities and those of privilege.<br/><br/>5.  The wealthiest people live on an orbital platform, known as \u201cThe Firmament.\u201d  It is the last vestige of working high technology.  Prior to the outbreak, it was destination resort and casino.  The inhabitants of The Firmament rule over their Earth-bound subjects through the Overseers, a class of privileged vassals with absolute authority.  The Firmament is reliant on the Earthsiders for foodstuffs, raw materials and replacement electronics.  The entirety of human existences on Earth is dedicated to the perpetuation of The Firmament.<br/><br/>6.  An almost religious feeling about the orbital complex exists amongst the Earthsiders.  Those who are deemed worthy are sometimes allowed to Ascend to The Firmament by means of a space elevator known colloquially as \u201cThe Spire\u201d.  The Spire is located in what was once Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.<br/><br/>7.  The Overseers are in complete control of the Earthside settlements, but have little influence outside them.  Scavenging is a necessary, lucrative and exceedingly dangerous activity.  The only sources of electronic circuitry and advanced materials are landfills, abandoned office complexes and old microchip plants.  Bands of doughty scavengers search out and collect these materials, which are then brought back to a settlement and sold to the Overseers, who send them up The Spire to be remanufactured on The Firmament into much-needed replacement parts.<br/><br/>8.  The Firmament\u2019s computer systems are still running Windows, because that\u2019s all there is.<br/><br/>9.  The Firmament has a huge central computer complex and database, once dedicated to gambling but since re-engineered for its current purpose.  The inhabitants maintain a vast virtual world, which serves as a diversion from the day-to-day dreariness that is life aboard a satellite.  The virtual world is vulnerable to power outages and hardware failure, which is why scavenged materials are so important \u2013 they are needed to continually shore up failing systems.<br/><br/>10.  Technology has been developed that allows one to upload one\u2019s entire personality and memories into the Firmament\u2019s database, thus allowing inhabitants to Ascend to immortality.  Uploading requires complete physical destruction of the brain.  The very first commander of the orbital platform, Goren, was also the first to be uploaded.  He is in fact still in command, communicating his edicts to the Imperator who then rules in his stead.  <br/><br/>PRAXIS:\tIdealism /\t\tRebellion /<br/>\tPragmatism\tConformity                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros" title="Maedhros"><img alt="Maedhros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros">Maedhros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196743/#Comment_196743" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-12T20:59:28+00:00" title="March 12, 2009  8:59PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PROTAGS AND ANTAGS:<br/><br/><b>Barz Gittering (Protag):</b>  A uniformed magistrate in charge of protecting the Earthside facilities of The Spire from intrusion, attack and sabotage.

Both have some experience with traditional "GM + players" games, but the structure of Shock: was new to them.  Both took to it like ducks to water, and we really had no major difficulties.  We did struggle a bit with the no-mutually-exclusive-intents during conflict - the natural default answer to the intent "I am going to punch you" is "I don't get punched".  When we ran into that issue we stopped, discussed and re-evaluated.  <br/><br/>Since it was just the three of us, we ended up negotiating the outcomes of conflicts as a group (rather than having the loser narrate) and this worked for us fairly well.  I pointedly tried to drive our protagonists together, and the result was satisfying.  One thing I did that was weird:  in Carole's second scene, Clamedia helped to spirit Mannheim and Persephone away from the security forces at the elevator landing.  Carole's Intent in the conflict was "Clamedia et al. escape through the perimeter."  As Clamedia's Antag I countered with "The security forces zap Persephone with the electro-prod and kill her" - as Antag I was threatening my own (i.e. Mannheim's) Link, and I won.  I wasn't sure how to resolve this, so I just replaced it with a newfound comradery with Clamedia.<br/><br/>Dean and Carole were both impressed with the game and surprised at how dystopic the ending turned out to be.<br/><br/>Shock:?

Some thoughts:<br/><br/>We've had many discussions with Dave on the "game/simulation/story" emphases of different roleplaying games. Fortunately, Carole got the benefit of the Fudge/FATE/SOTC system, so both of us were naturally oriented toward a co-story-telling game.  Of course, it was helpful that Dave had played the game before, to lead us through any tricky parts.<br/><br/>As Dave alluded to above, it's natural to respond to "you punch me" with "you DON'T punch me".  There was only one situation where this got tricky--when Mannheim and daughter wanted to descend the spire, I had a hard time coming up with a good Antagonist response that wasn't along the lines of "you can't."  Dave finally came up with the solution: The virus "signals ahead that we're coming".  Ultimately that combination worked: They descended and the guards were waiting for them (we both succeeded in our intents).<br/><br/>This solution illustrates that if we're co-story-telling, it's not crucial that the mechanics be followed to the letter.  In fact, as Dave notes, on more than one occasion we jointly decided what would be the most "interesting" course for the story.<br/><br/>It is important, I think, to note that the rather apocalyptic outcome was the direct result of the audience's D4, and the "escalation of conflict" mechanism.  It was the audience, if I recall correctly, that created the escalation, that led to the final result of the story.  We've been chuckling about that outcome ever since and wondering if in fact (he taps his blackberry) it hasn't happened already!<br/><br/>The only comment I would make about the game: I would have preferred to have a more explicit "outline" or "flowchart" of the sequence of events.  To that end, Dave, Carole and I have developed such an outline.  I'll post it below for comment and of course criticism.  IF we've missed some important game mechanism (I'll take primary responsibility), please do let us know!
