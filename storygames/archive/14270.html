In most cases, it's the smaller companies and products which go open rather than the big ones, so the Open Game License and System Reference Document are extraordinary in that sense. I suspect that open licences give the greatest competitive advantage to smaller companies, but the rising tide of the d20 boom did seem to lift Wizards' boat along with everyone else's.  <br/><br/>Of course, they rejected an open licence for 4E. That strongly suggests that they think the OGL was a bad idea. Now that Pathfinder is such a powerful competitor, I wonder if they're even more disappointed by the OGL. <br/><br/>I do wonder what would have happened if 4E was open. I suspect that more publishers would have chosen 4E over 3E and Pathfinder would have lost a lot of its third party support. Necromancer Games is an obvious example of a <i>very</i> enthusiastic publisher who ended up rejecting 4E altogether. <br/><br/><b>Other Games</b><br/>Eclipse Phase was released under a semi-open licence, and <a href="http://www.eclipsephase.com/posthuman-2010-year-end-review" rel="nofollow">its creators are very happy about that.</a><br/><br/>Anima Prime was released under an open licence as it was published; parts of Beast Hunters were retrospectively released under an open licence. Hopefully Christian Griffen will chime in with his experiences there.<br/><br/>Time &amp; Temp is under an open licence. I know nothing about it's sales, but it's not the first game Epidiah has released under an open licence -- so I assume he was happy with the commercial success of the previous games.<br/><br/>I know nothing about the commercial success of indie games vs Monsters (open), Wushu/Wushu Open (open), The Dreaming Crucible (open) or CRN Games (Clinton Nixon's games; some are open) -- but depending on how interested you are, those are all leads you could follow up.<br/><br/><b>Ransom Model Games</b><br/>These games/supplements are only released after being funded -- in some cases, they're only <i>written</i> after being funded. Obviously that's a model where an open/semi-open licence is a lot less risky, but I think they're worth discussing.<br/><br/>4C System was released into the public domain.<br/><br/>REIGN supplements have been released under a semi-open licence, and there have been over thirteen of those -- so that licence has presumably benefited Greg Stolze (but not enough for him to release the original game). <br/><br/><b>'Third Party' Stuff</b><br/>A big chunk of the open gaming market is made up of retroclones, d20-based games and FATE games. These are by third party publishers, so that's all I'll say about them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323888/#Comment_323888" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T05:55:37+00:00" title="May 11, 2011  5:55AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My understanding is that Wizards of the Coast's D&amp;D 3E sales benefited due to the OGL. But it hurt Wizards of the Coast's financially outside of D&amp;D 3E. <br/><br/>The OGL allowed third party companies to release brand new games based on the OGL that had no connection back to D&amp;D 3E. <br/><br/>Companies were able to release OGL Superhero and Modern RPGs before Wizards of the Coast did. I don't know the numbers but the feeling at Wizards by some was that Mutants &amp; Masterminds and Spycraft hurt Wizards financially as they had plans for expansion beyond the fantasy genre (and did expand in the cases of Modern and Future D20). <br/><br/>But an even bigger impact that Wizards probably never expected is that the OGL allowed companies to make money off of their earlier editions when D&amp;D released new editions. Pathfinder has allowed D&amp;D 3E to stay alive in the wake of D&amp;D 4E and has hurt Wizards dearly. To a lesser extent, the OGL allowed small publishers to release clones of Original D&amp;D after Wizards stopped selling PDFs of older versions of the game. <br/><br/>Now the OGL wasn't the only factor. Mutants &amp; Masterminds and Spycraft were excellent games. D&amp;D 4E was a large departure from what existing fans were used to or wanted. And there were easily several other dozen business factors that shook things up. <br/><br/>That all said, Wizards is likely the biggest and most extreme example. I'd love to hear how the OGL has affected games like FATE.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323893/#Comment_323893" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T06:57:30+00:00" title="May 11, 2011  6:57AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 11, 2011 7:45AM by Simon_Rogers.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, guys, very helpful analysis.<br/><br/>Edit: I note that Eclipse Phase offers a non-commercial license.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323900/#Comment_323900" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T08:23:04+00:00" title="May 11, 2011  8:23AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's also interesting, at least to me, that the easiest way for a publisher to be hurt (rather than helped) by opening up their content is if they aren't prepared to compete successfully with or cooperate with other publishers who want to build on their material.<br/><br/>Can you imagine the superhero game that Wizards might have eventually put out? Can you imagine, in your wildest dreams, that it would be better than what Steve Kenson put together?  I can't.  Green Ronin didn't just release some half-assed d20 supers game, they released one WAY BETTER than what WOTC could have done.  And that's way more of a threat than "d20 Cybernetics Tome" or some of the other releases.<br/><br/>Really, the 4E GSL doesn't restrict publishers completely, but it does enough to make it impossible for third-parties to compete successfully with WOTC at their own game.  I think if the GSL was more open, you'd have a lot more indie game designers (since a lot of us were really excited about the direction that 4E took, design-wise) coming out with content and hacks for it that would have fixed a lot of its problems.  And that could have helped WOTC, or it could have further split up the market if the hacks were stand-alone and functioned a lot better than straight-up 4E (which wouldn't be all that hard).<br/><br/>So I think making decisions about opening up content partially depends on looking at your publishing plans and deciding whether having third-parties make their own products is going to make some of your plans irrelevant or give people the tools necessary to compete successfully with you.  And maybe you don't even care about that if what you really want is there to be high quality products for you game, whoever's making them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323905/#Comment_323905" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T09:11:38+00:00" title="May 11, 2011  9:11AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed about Mutants &amp; Masterminds.<br/><br/>Although Wizards released Modern D20 which was excellent but never caught on. Spycraft already captured the attention of people who would have played Modern D20. I knew many people who wanted to introduce Modern D20 into their groups but they had all started playing Spycraft already and switching games was non-trivial given how much investment D20 style games require.<br/><br/>That's likely another factor. If your game supports long term play, then it's a style of game where switching to different games can be difficult. Boardgame fans jump back and forth between different games all the time. But the investment in D&amp;D likely means it takes more for people to switch games. Which could exacerbate the issue Wizards experienced with the OGL. But for a game that isn't meant to be long term, you may not experience the same problems. <br/><br/>I also agree that if the GSL was more open, we would have seen more support by indie game designers. But the Character Builder would have also needed to become more open. If your content isn't in the Character Builder, that's 40,000-200,000 hardcore gamers that will never use your content. But on the flip side, Wizards is adding so much content at such a quick pace that they have already created a glut of options without including third party material. <br/><br/>Simon, I would definitely recommend contacting Fred and Rob at Evil Hat. I suspect their experience using the OGL for FATE will be a better representation of what your comany using the OGL would be like (assuming that's why you are asking).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323912/#Comment_323912" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T10:06:45+00:00" title="May 11, 2011 10:06AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            d20 Modern was also kinda weird, though, right John? I mean, their first release was Urban Arcana, which basically told you to keep playing D&amp;D, just in the modern world with killer dumpsters and stuff, maybe aimed more at the Shadowrun crowd or something.  I thought it was a really weird move.  And putting a bunch of drow gangbangers on the cover was another really odd choice ("they're black elves, get it").  Not sure what was going on there.  Were there other notable releases after that?  I'm having a hard time remembering any. d20 Future, I guess? But that kinda seemed like its own thing.  In any event, a lot of confusion in marketing there.<br/><br/>You're right that the best example in indie circles is probably Fate. Diaspora, Starblazers, and Anglerre are pretty significant third-party releases, combined with "official" ones like SOTC and Dresden. I can definitely imagine something similar happening with Trail, Esoterrorists, Mutant City Blues, Night's Black Agents, Ashen Stars, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323917/#Comment_323917" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T10:58:44+00:00" title="May 11, 2011 10:58AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're right, there were a bunch of weird factors with D20 Modern. Urban Arcana itself though was a separate book campaign setting for D20 Modern. <br/><br/>At the time Spycraft was getting huge and people kept saying, why do I need D20 Modern if I have all these other options? Additionally, there was talk of moving popular games into the D20 system which upset many people. Lots of, "leave my Shadowrun alone" comments. Cthulhu D20 failed. Deadlands D20 was controversial. There was a significant backlash. And the game definitely felt more aimed at Shadowrun or D&amp;D but now. Which people didn't want. They wanted Spycraft or they didn't see any reason to play Shadowrun in a different system. <br/><br/>I know there were plans for a D20 Supers game and D20 Modern variants but Wizards quickly refocused back to D&amp;D. Although I remember on the OGL mailinglists, the OGL was being blamed (or scapegoated). <br/><br/>Possibly a tangent, but there were also instances of people trying to take advantage of the OGL without buying into the spirit of open content. I remember Mutants &amp; Masterminds caught negative attention because they didn't have a system resource document available for their OGL content and at some point there was controversy over fans uploading Mutants &amp; Masterminds OGL content on their own\u2026 even though it was perfectly legal under the OGL. <br/><br/>Paizo on the other hand is constantly praised in the OGL community by not only using the OGL but giving back. Their online SRD is well detailed and supported by Paizo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323920/#Comment_323920" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T11:34:30+00:00" title="May 11, 2011 11:34AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When talking about the Ransom model and Reign something struck me as interesting.<br/><br/>For the first 11 supplements, it was doing pretty well. Then the 12th one came in, was set at a $900 ransom instead of the $1000 one, and it almost didn't make it. Stolze hasn't gone for a Supplement 13. All that has happened is Nain, Ardwin and Violent Planet.<br/><br/>Now with Nain there was some interest still, but since then I think it's died off too. People just aren't that interested in new content for it anymore it seems. That would also be why he hasn't released the base system. Right now it's if you buy Reign, you get a bunch of free content as well, so it's an incredibly good deal, and from there it seems to be the only source of income he has.<br/><br/>From there I'd think that a fully open license, especially with the base system doesn't benefit small writers all that much.<br/><br/>Kickstarter might have sucked it out for him as well - when he started with it, it seemed like he was one of the only guys doing it, but now with everybody using Kickstarter, it seems like he might be getting lost, and I remember ORE fans suffering a bit of fatigue with Bigger Bads coming so soon after Enchiridion, and Progenitor following Bigger Bads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_323921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323921/#Comment_323921" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T11:45:12+00:00" title="May 11, 2011 11:45AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>My understanding is that Wizards of the Coast's D&amp;D 3E sales benefited due to the OGL.

The d20 STL benefitted D&amp;D sales, the OGL didn't. I think what probably hurt them more is D&amp;D 3.5. The moment 3.5 was released people were a bit pissed off, so they started looking at other things. Mongoose's Pocket PHB was a big one there - people could get 3.5 rules for a lot cheaper. If WotC had stuck with 3e, left it flaws and all, that people would have continued to stick with it. Mongoose may have decided to release a 3e PPHB, but it probably wouldn't have taken off quite the same way since by then most people would have still had it. Continuing to sell old edition PDFs would have also taken out the appeal of retro-clones. So I think the bad results of the OGL only came because of bad decisions they made outside of the OGL.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323929/#Comment_323929" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-11T12:51:44+00:00" title="May 11, 2011 12:51PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed that the D20 STL (System Trademark License) benefited D&amp;D sales more than the OGL. But there is no STL without the Open Gaming Content which was governed by the SRD (System Reference Documents). The STL allowed 3rd party companies to brand their content with a D20 trademark as long as they followed the STL guidelines (requiring the use of the D&amp;D Player's Handbook) and restricted what material they referenced or used to Open Game Content defined by the SRD. The OGL was a separate license that drew on the same Open Gaming Content but did not require the PHB at the cost of not having access to the D20 trademark. There was also OGL content that benefited D&amp;D sales (I bought many OGL feat books that stopped using the STL because the OGL was easier) but STL content was by far the most impactful. <br/><br/>There were a long line of decisions that hurt Wizards. From D&amp;D 3.5, to pulling Dragon magazine, to discontinuing PDF sales, to the virtual tabletop being years late, to misleading customers, to terrible marketing, to abandoning popular editions of the game, to changing the focus of their main products, and alienating existing customers.

It's sold around 70 copies in its first month (though this second one is notably slower; but there also aren't reviews or AP threads yet).<br/><br/>The good that's come from it being open source is already immense, though. There's an Italian translation of the core rules, and Italy has become the second largest market by far in terms of sales. My investment in the game, financially, is much lower because people became passionate about the game during its open development and contributed a lot. So I've already more than made my financial investment back just in the first month.<br/><br/>For me personally, it feels great to know that people can read the game before putting money down. It alleviates my concern over buyer's remorse. Also, it makes the game available to people who can't otherwise afford it.<br/><br/>So, it's a total win situation for me at this point.

One of the reasons for open licences is to allow a project to be 'split' -- "We're not happy with the stuff you're writing for Apocalypse World, Vincent, so we're going to release Disaster World and market all our products as being compatible with Disaster World only". Obviously that's not possible if it needs Vincent's permission. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I don't think using someone else's open work puts any kind of moral obligation on you to make it available free-of-charge in any way. In other words, I don't think Green Ronin's refusal to release an SRD or it's request for OGC M&amp;M material to be taken down is in any way hypocritical or unreasonable. (To put it simply, there's no necessary connection between gratis [free of charge] and libre/open [you're free to use it however you want]).<br/><br/>I should have explained myself when I called Eclipse Phase 'semi-open' -- 'open source' and 'open content' works can always be sold by anyone, so semi-open is my term for works that cannot be sold. Others in the movement just lump all semi-open works in with 'proprietary' works (all rights reserved). <br/><br/>People have been talking about FATE. However, FATE is a 'third party' game in that it had to be open because Fudge (its progenitor) was open. My impression was that Simon would want us to talk about whether <b>Fudge</b> benefited from the open licence, not whether FATE did. Was I wrong, Simon?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>Really, the 4E GSL doesn't restrict publishers completely, but it does enough to make it impossible for third-parties to compete successfully with WOTC at their own game.  I think if the GSL was more open, you'd have a lot more indie game designers (since a lot of us were really excited about the direction that 4E took, design-wise) coming out with content and hacks for it that would have fixed a lot of its problems.  And that could have helped WOTC, or it could have further split up the market if the hacks were stand-alone and functioned a lot better than straight-up 4E (which wouldn't be all that hard).</blockquote>\nMy experience from 3E is that splitting is mainly illusory. Many 'self-contained games' were released using the SRD as a core (M&amp;M, Arcana Evolved, True20, Star Wars RPG, etc.) but I think that the systems were so close to 3E D&amp;D that people didn't really distinguish between D&amp;D products and products that were ostensibly for split games. But I could be wrong about that.<br/><br/>Great discussion, folks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324050/#Comment_324050" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T03:35:38+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  3:35AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2011 11:42AM by Simon_Rogers.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">@Sanglorian</a> Technically, no, but I'd still like to hear how FATE was affected commercially by its second-hand openness.<br/><br/>To be clear, as a gamer, I'm all for the OGL, but I have to be more cautious as a publisher.

Indirectly, the presence of a body of work by other publishers might possibly be one of a long list of selling points, but honestly, if theres one thing that the d20 glut and even the current Pathfinder glut has taught me (and every other gamer I know), it is to be very cautious of any third party material for any system, because it's probably mediocre.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, especially for Indie games that are only going to sell a few thousand copies, this is a question that is nearly entirely up to personal preference. I can't imagine more than a few dozen designers or loopy open source pursists who will refuse to buy a good game solely because the author wants to retain some control over their creation, or who will buy a game they otherwise don't care about solely because it is open source. My honest belief is that this is a decision that will have no material effect on sales for anyone. There is a lot of WotC talk, but figuring out what effect the OGL had on their sales involves a huge counterfactual exercise that is pure speculation. If you ask Ryan Dancey about the OGL, he will tout its huge success in making DnD the 'default operating system' for gaming for nearly a decade, retailers will tell you it did as much harm as good, Paizo will be cagey about the fact that they were basically handed their company and success on a platter by WotC, and 4e DnD sells just fine with no OGL, just not to people who were already playing 3.5, but to NEW players (and the board games have been a hit, too), the vast majority of whom just want to play DnD and do not care about whether it is open or closed or creative commons or whatever.<br/><br/>Make your game. Make it good. Then do whatever you want as far as how open it is, because that's mainly a political decision and not a sales and marketing decision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324106/#Comment_324106" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T10:40:18+00:00" title="May 12, 2011 10:40AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think trying to learn from what D&amp;D did is a little like trying to design your bike's spinners from looking at the Space Shuttle.

This allows Evil Hat to exercise quality control by holding back or granting that mark of approval -- but the content of the game, its rules and descriptions can be used by anyone for any purpose without their permission.<br/><br/>Sage, since game rules aren't covered by copyright law the mechanics of every game are 'open'. But a large part of the rules of a game are the way those rules are described and the context that they're placed in, and I think that description and context needs to be open for the rules to be usable.<br/><br/>I think you're right that the relationship between Dungeon World and Apocalypse World looks a lot like that of Mutants &amp; Masterminds and D&amp;D -- but would it still look similar if you were a commercial publisher directly competing with Vincent?

It's permission to use mechanics, the supporting structures and particular expressions free from worry of legal action. Just because mechanics aren't protected doesn't mean a company will refrain from getting litigious over them, effectively squashing anybody that doesn't have the money to mount a defense. So from that perspective, a large company like WotC/Hasbro putting the game under an OGL is pretty significant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324293/#Comment_324293" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-13T07:00:06+00:00" title="May 13, 2011  7:00AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 29, 2012 8:24PM by Wordman.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>Which, yes, gets into the whole murky area of creative rights and game design, copyright, patent, etc.</blockquote>\nAs far as procedural mechanics in a game go, this area is not that murky: <a href="http://www.godsmonsters.com/Features/why-do-we-need-open/" rel="nofollow">game mechanics cannot be copyrighted</a>.<br/><br/>Other stuff gets murkier.

As Jim Crocker noted above, as a retailer, he doesn't believe he's sold any games on the basis of them being open content. What matters for sales, I think, is "simple" -- a quality product, and gameplay and other experiences around the game that create good gaming stories that gamers feel a need to tell each other. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is possible that for some Fate players, the openness of the system is one of those other experiences. Even though it's simply true that every system there is is open to a little or a lot of homebrew tinkering for your own table of play, explicit permission to tinker still has an effect on people. When they get such permission, the potential exists that they're also getting an added sense of ownership of the game, a personal relationship with it that gets a stamp of validity. That's not nothin'. I don't know if it adds sales potential for the product itself, but I would surmise it certainly adds a greater depth of satisfaction with the product.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I'll get specific about Evil Hat for a moment here. Here's what Fate's release schedule would've looked like without an open commercial license behind it:<br/>\n<br/>\n2003: Fate 2<br/>\n2006: Spirit of the Century<br/>\n2010: Dresden Files RPG<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd ... done. That's it. Instead, we got (just to go by the RPG.net game index):<br/>\n<br/>\n2003: Fate 2<br/>\n2006: Spirit of the Century<br/>\n2008: Starblazer Adventures<br/>\n2009: Diaspora<br/>\n2009: Awesome Adventures<br/>\n2009: Free Fate<br/>\n2010: Dresden Files RPG<br/>\n2010: Legends of Anglerre<br/>\n2010: Limitless Horizons<br/>\n2010: Strands of Fate<br/>\n2011: Bulldogs! (coming this summer)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is likely incomplete (and definitely doesn't include Fate influenced non-Fate games like ICONS, Houses, Chronica, etc). So from the perspective of meeting demand that exceeded Evil Hat's ability to produce (I'm reasonably confident this has happened), the OGL worked, and since Fate is not at the core of the most popular/highest name recognition RPG product in the world, the "pile-on" volume has stayed well below the d20 glut phenomenon of yesteryear.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, commercially, the most benefit I can say Evil Hat *might* have gotten from this is "sustained interest" and/or an increased sense of Fate as a "real system" that's getting "support". (I put quotes around those simply to highlight my uncertainty about their value.) Would the DFRPG have gotten fewer sales if there'd been zero Fate activity between 2006 and 2010? Maybe? Maybe not?<br/>\n<br/>\nDownsides: Even though we inherited our system's open license stance from its predecessors, I don't regret the fact of it. But I have at times gotten to feeling sick of it -- see my December post for that: http://www.deadlyfredly.com/2010/12/confessional/ -- simply because there's been the occasional offshoot effort that either (more charitably) doesn't match my own tastes for what's to be done with the system, or (less charitably) which I think is adding nothing new or is missing the point. <br/>\n<br/>\nOpen licensing is a rough stance to take if you feel like your vision needs to be preserved. No matter how much you bake it into your system, your vision, your vibe, will get compromised when it gets munged by third-party hands. Sometimes that's for the better (Diaspora caught my attention because it was *not* the Fate I knew but was doing some new and different and in places better things), and sometimes it's not, and those "not" times may weigh on you a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes right down to it, I think it's about figuring out what compromise you want to strike between control and community. I like elements of both, so Evil Hat has often tried to sit in the middle of that compromise continuum, whether it's been via an open license or not. Too much control and you end up with fans who feel shut out, I think, which leads to waning interest. Too much community, and it gets difficult for newcomers to figure out what's wheat and what's chaff in what's available. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere's no one right answer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324374/#Comment_324374" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-13T15:39:25+00:00" title="May 13, 2011  3:39PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Aside: CoC d20 and d20 Modern sold incredibly well.

If we're not talking sales, what kind of success are we talking about?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324429/#Comment_324429" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T09:44:30+00:00" title="May 14, 2011  9:44AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2011 9:51AM by jenskot.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Buzz, good points but I didn't say we're not talking sales. I wrote: "<b>You can't compare sales alone</b> when determining if something is a success." That's a huge, huge difference. <br/><br/>Also, I'm not the one deeming d20 Cthulhu a success or failure. I was talking from the perspective of people at Wizards (at the time at Gen Con I asked them when the next Cthulhu product would be released and they said the sales and licensing restrictions didn't justify additional material and in private I was told it was considered a failure because the hope was to capture more of the existing CoC fanbase). To me personally, it was a huge success... it led to many amazing games and hours of entertainment for my friends. <br/><br/>When you look at overall success, you need to compare sales to profits to costs to effort all within the context of your long term goals. <br/><br/>For example, with a licensed product, you may be paying licensing fees, splitting royalties, production times may be longer due to extended approval processes, you may need to renegotiate your contract when looking to put out additional works based on that license, and much more. Some of this is balanced by not having to pay for art assets (although sometimes you still have to pay for these) and free marketing. But often your sales will need to be higher than they would be for a non-licensed release. Also sales in the early 2000s aren't comparable to sales in 2011. Sales for a mid-range game back then would be considered a huge success now. <br/><br/>But Migo is right, d20 CoC doesn't fit into the open gaming discussion. On the first page it explicitly says that no portion of this book is open gaming content. And unlike d20 Modern, CoC wasn't competing directly with other similar OGL works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324433/#Comment_324433" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-14T09:57:37+00:00" title="May 14, 2011  9:57AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Understood, John. <br/><br/>Apologies for the tangent, folks.
