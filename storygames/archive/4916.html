It's about fallen angels, demons and humanity. It's not important. My problem while working on the game(and why I became frustrated and abandoned it for a few months) is that I can't seem to let go of my preconceptions of how an rpg ''should be''. And by this I mean, I can only see this game as a WOD game clone. I love games like DitV, DRYH that have specific systems that don't follow the ''Abilities-Skills-Perks'' template(and have 20 of each), but when it comes to creating a game, I can't get my head around NOT going that way. <br/>So what do I do? I think im afraid that deviating from the ''traditional'' rpg model I might make a system that doesn't work or something.<br/>Help meeeeeeee!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110206/#Comment_110206" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T03:30:53+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  3:30AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I suggest you make the very best WOD game clone you can.

Since then I decided the game is a bit similar to CoC and DitV in it's heart. It's about fallen angels travelling and taking care of business with guns and powers. It's focus is on violent, gritty action but a bit on the realistic side. To draw a pararel, I'll mention Fight Club's fights and Tarantino shoot-outs. <br>My main problem is, I'm not a system guy. I don't have any specific views on systems. I'm rarely impressed by systems(though I do like alot of indie games since I've started reading them) and mostly I just go along with the system. <br>For ''Fallen'' I want something that can handle brutal and visceral fights and battles. It's a big part of the game but I want it to be more fun than realistic, so in this regard the Storyteller system(d10) works relatively well. You get to throw a shitload of d10 dice(more dice the better you are), can soak damage(fights last longer, players have more chances of surviving a fight) and is generally fun to play.<br>On the other hand, I don't really need all those abilities and skills. The game is mostly <b>investigation&gt;fight&gt;resolution/consequences.</b><br>I want some mechanics that can give me deeper gameplay when it comes to characters(right/wrong, social bonds), but it's too early for that.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110320/#Comment_110320" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T09:58:16+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  9:58AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: northerain</cite>My main problem is, I'm not a system guy.

You don't have any specific views on system? Great! Now you can steal inspiration from all of them without worrying whether they fit into your preconceived notions of what a system "should" be like. You're rarely impressed by systems? Awesome! Now you're freed from the burden of having to make your system "impressive". Mostly you just go along with the system? Perfect! Now you can just go along with the system <i>as you're creating it.</i><br><br>Imagine yourself playing a session of the game -- not the in-game fiction or the actual mechanics but just what you want the experience of sitting there playing the game to be like. It sounds like you've already got a good idea what the structure of play is like, with your investigation&gt;fight&gt;resolution/consequences, so think about how you, as a player, want to <i>do</i> those things.<br><br>Investigation, for example. Your character is investigating something; what are you doing as a player to make that happen? Are you "just talking" with the GM, waiting for him to feed you clues? Are you rolling your Investigate Stuff skill? Are you talking to NPCs to get bonuses to your Investigate Stuff skill roll? Are you playing out a full-on Investigative Combat encounter, attacking the mystery's Inscrutability Defense with your +2 Laptop of Penetrating Research? Something else altogether?<br/><br/>Wait, did I say NPCs? Where do <i>those</i> come from? Are <i>you</i> the one saying "OK, so my guy goes and chats with the sexy librarian at the university" or is the <i>GM</i> telling you "OK, so you go chat with the grumpy old occult bookstore dude"? Say your character is trying to wring information out of a reluctant source. How's that work? Are you "just talking" with the GM, waiting for him to tell you whether you win or not? Are you rolling your Wring Information skill? Are you in full-on Social Combat, attacking the guy's I Ain't Telling You Nothing Defense with a synergy bonus from your +4 Badass Leather Trenchcoat of Unspoken Menace?<br/><br/>What if your character <i>doesn't</i> succeed in wringing the information out of the source? Can you try again? Can you buy a do-over by spending a Screw You, Man, I'm a Main Character Token? What if you're out of tokens? Can another player give you one of theirs? Even if they weren't in the scene with you?<br/><br/>Wait, did I say other players? Oh yeah! What are <i>they</i> doing during your wringing information scene? Are they just listening to you and the GM while patiently waiting their turns? Are they offering you suggestions? Giving you resources? Injecting color and detail into the scene? Are they taking over NPCs? Are they <i>heckling</i> you and wagering resources on the outcome?\n<blockquote>On the other hand, I don't really need all those abilities and skills.</blockquote>\nYeah, that's a problem I have. I'm always falling into the trap of trying to put in all the abilities and traits I think I need to make a "complete character", rather than just concentrating on the ones that reflect <i>what the game is about.</i> That's where I find visualizing the act of play really helpful. By paying attention to the times when I'd want to reach for the dice/hand over a token/scribble on the character sheet/whatever, I know what rules I <i>need</i> to write in order for the game to play the way I'd like.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110324/#Comment_110324" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T10:06:00+00:00" title="November 29, 2007 10:06AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Ron said.

That is to very emphatically state:  It's okay to screw up.  It's <em>very okay</em> to make a system that doesn't work at all.  You learn from that, internalize it, and try again.  Mistakes are okay.  Our bad designs teach us a lot.  And if you feel that the system you designed has some deep, deep flaws that make it worth trashing, that's okay to do -- you're allowed to completely switch out anything when you're designing, even things you think are fundamental.<br/><br/>This is the design equivalent to the important advice in fiction: "no matter who you are, your first draft always sucks.

In short, show the situation (the shredded body, the shattered window) and have in mind the cause/case (Demon Dan the milkman has fed) and let the players suggest clues (the footprints under the window, who was around at the time of day). This could even go further: don't even have a case planned; let the players define their own opposition, organically.<br/><br/>So, if a clue would fit the case, Say Yes--they find the footprints, the foot prints lead to the curbside, the tire tracks are readable. If not, say No But--the tracks are from a step-van truck not a car, you can't follow them but can take a photo (and then, Yes, the local mechanic can recognize the tread--it's from the milk truck).<br/><br/>That way, the players are doing the investigating more than the characters (i.e. they are thinking, not rolling); and the moment they start to go too far afield, you can reign them back in a freeform manner, with a No But. "Investigation" stats are sucky, anyway: "Ooo! I'm so smart 'cause I got Investigation 25! OK, GM, tell me how it <i>all</i> happened--spare not a single detail--and then we'll get to The Real Game of Killing!" Bleh... I'll be the Dumb Brick who plays Wii while the Smart Investigator makes rolls to figure out where to Aim Me.<br/><br/>Just 2\xa2 from a GM who's written up far too many breadcrumbs, only to have the players searching for Theseus' string instead....<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
