Myself, I spend most of my prep time writing crunch (which can take however long I care to spend with it) and just do the rest of it in real-time. Then again, I know GMs who literally draw the adventure map on paper carefully (which I don't as I do the procedure in my head), give their NPCs statistics, write a bandolier of bangs and so on, all in prep time (as opposed to during the session as I tend to do myself).<br/><br/>I'd say that my general prep time for the average session is 15 minutes when I don't get on a crunch-writing binge. Even doing things in detail, I couldn't imagine spending more than an hour before the chargen, two hours before the first session and half an hour before each individual session after that. Double those for a first-timer, account for lack of inspiration and that's probably just about as high as it gets with the methods reviewed in the last chapter of the SS booklet.<br/><br/>Players don't have to do prep at all, Solar System is similar to traditional games in that regard. All the planning they need to do is "play", while much of what the SG has to do is "prep". Life is unfair that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188905/#Comment_188905" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-18T14:48:05+00:00" title="January 18, 2009  2:48PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, interesting Eero.  So If I had a R-Map, I could write up bangs in say 15-30 minutes for a good 3 hours of play?  I understand starting out may be a bit slower.  Does it afford generous Player creative authorship to where they can take the game in interesting directions?  My group would definitely not do adventure map on paper, extensive NPC stats.  Rather, I would imagine writing down a couple of scenes I had in mind and a bang or two for each player and running with it.<br/><br/>Finally, does it require much NPC crunch?  For instance, to effectively use an NPC who will enter conflict in Burning Wheel you really need to burn the NPC up and spend a decent amount of time developing them.  Is Solar System more forgiving in this regard?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188906/#Comment_188906" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-18T15:09:32+00:00" title="January 18, 2009  3:09PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            2 numbers + 2 descriptors is enough stats for a usable Solar System NPC.<br/>Meaning you can easily make those up on the fly, mechanics-wise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188909/#Comment_188909" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-18T15:27:00+00:00" title="January 18, 2009  3:27PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2009 3:27PM by JuddG.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Charles,<br/><br/>It sounds like Solar will be a good fit for you and your group.  The prep is minimal, and usually just pre-loading ideas so you don't have to pen them out during play.  No big NPC stat bases and the players do get a tremendous say in their personal stories as well as the direction of the game (mostly through the Keys they take and focus on collecting from).<br/><br/>As a first time GM, look at the Keys of the players for clues on where they want to initially push in the game and create some bangs and some NPC threads that will be likely encounters in that direction.  Also, when a player drops a Key, it usually reflects a moment where they feel they have dealt with that issue, and look for how you can help them in expressing the end of that Key as a driving factor for them.  Table chatter at such times is most informative.<br/><br/>[edited because I spell like a chimp]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188910/#Comment_188910" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-18T15:29:08+00:00" title="January 18, 2009  3:29PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you everyone, just purchased the PDF.

Jari'll get it to you tomorrow (it's 2am here in Finland now, I'm being nocturnal) I expect. I write in there about prep to some greater length than Clinton does in the old text, although yet more could easily be said. SS is very much a GM's game in that it has traditional flexibility in what you do and how you do it. I was very careful to describe my own general approach in the booklet, but there's a lot of leeway for going other ways with the method without running afoul of the rules. NPCs, for instance - I myself simply get bored with preparing stat blocks for anything at all pre-game, so I pretty much had to streamline the character rules for NPCs so that I could just prepare the character's fluff in advance (in my head, again) and thrown down mechanics on the spot if they became necessary.<br/><br/>Hey, now that I think of it, I'm actually currently writing extensively about advanced approaches to GMing the game:<br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=27307.0" rel="nofollow">Colonization of Qek</a><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=27400.0" rel="nofollow">War in Khale</a><br/>These are advanced stuff written to be playtested, so they practically require understanding how the game deals with protagonism and campaign structure in the first place - but they might give you an idea of how far a given Story Guide might go in customizing the tools they use in preparing their play. The first thread posits a primarily geography-based preparation where the SG derives his Bangs and consequences not from a relationship map but from an actual map. The second tries to visualize military scifi functionally as a genre of drama by making war room scenes a basis for scene framing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188979/#Comment_188979" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T07:26:14+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  7:26AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Charles,<br/>\n  I made my own version of an R-Map. That was all. The rest really should come from player's char sheets.<br/>\nhttp://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26976.0<br/>\n  The idea I was going for was to support different game types. Like, if the players wanted to do a dungeon delve, then there was support for doing this, the old Maldor city is nearby and some of the players on the political scene have a stake in sponsoring expeditions into the old city. Of course a setup like this easily supports any sort of political intrigue game. And with all these high rollers, this supports a heist style game. That's the idea I had.<br/>\n  Once the party was made, it was trivial to come up with some bang-like plot hooks to throw at the players.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Generally, the game supports on-the-fly chargen pretty easily. All you need to know to make an NPC is, what are their pools like (for one-shot characters, you can just give them one or no pool), What their main Ability is and what level it is. You can throw in a secret or two if necessary.to bring on a good challenge. And then determkine weapon and armor bonuses (also not necesary except for amping up the Challenge level).<br/>\n  Hope this helps you game.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189190/#Comment_189190" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-20T12:52:51+00:00" title="January 20, 2009 12:52PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I've done a few one-shots or several session runs, and I follow the advice for prep in TSOY and that's about it.

Building off what happened in the last session, I would plan an opening scene for each of the characters to hit one of his Keys.  I would also make a rough outline of things related to the overall situation that I expected to happen in the upcoming session.  This was helped by the fact that, after a certain point, all the characters had Key of the Mission, so their greater goals were pretty obvious.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the beginning of the session, I would go around the table and have one of these Key scenes with each player.  With four other players, it would take anywhere from 40 to 80 minutes to complete these.  The rest of the three- or four-hour session would concern their overall goal, although this was often colored by unpredictable consequences of the Key scenes.  Between the Keys and the general nature of the game system, the players provided most of the direction for the campaign sessions, which was enjoyable for everyone even though I was unaccustomed to doing so much work on the fly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I didn't use one for that campaign, I agree that a relationship map is a helpful tool, and that along with the characters' Keys are about all one needs to be an effective Story Guide.  As for the abilities of the Story Guide Characters, I would just eyeball them based on the qualitative rank descriptions in the book.  It can be hard to effectively challenge the characters in The Shadow of Yesterday, but then again, it's more about how the characters grow and change in the course of their adventures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
