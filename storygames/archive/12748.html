Not sure if this has more to do with the fact that he's a fugitive or an accused rapist, but both really bother me. On the other hand I'm sure there are things I enjoy from artists all over and that those artists have done things I would find morally reprehensible. Its hard to say. I think that if the persons problem is that they don't want to support someones behavior by supporting their life style now, that a good thing, but if they're saying they don't want to interact with it after they've passed on or (and maybe this is the American in me talking) paid for their crimes, I don't see the point. I do think its valid however, to consider the artist as a person when considering their art. Also, how does the chearns know what this person's views are. I know Dave Sims, the creator of the indie comic Cerebus, gets a lot of guff for being a misogynist, but the evidence people site to prove this is scant and Sims as person has spoken out against anti-feminist positions and said that he does not, himself have anything against women.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286590/#Comment_286590" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T01:08:58+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  1:08AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: timonkey</cite>4)<i>Should</i>the author's views affect peoples' purchasing habits?</blockquote>\nplenty of people vote with their dollars.  generally you have to pick and choose your ethical battles.  there are games i don't buy because the book looks like garbage or maybe it's poorly edited.  in some cases these are very successful games.  silly and destructive me for not buying a fun game for aesthetics.  in other cases still there are games that i won't play because i've had a chance to meet the designer on a number of occasions and they've acted like complete jackasses.<br/><br/>meeting the "artist" can often ruin the art.  it's a pity.  there before me lays the little fun-machine you've created and all i can do is quell the internal dialogue that screams NO.

Sometimes.  Depends on the views, depends on what I'm considering purchasing.<br/><br/>2.  Oh, it totally matters.  How could it not?  I mean, I'm not going to buy a racist/misogynist work, because I don't want to own such a thing.  If those odious views are not conveyed by that work, I might consider getting it.  (But it does seem a bit unlikely that anyone with strong, terrible opinions is going to be able to keep them from showing through in their work, so...)<br/><br/>3.  Again, that depends.  I suppose I could see a hypothetical situation where there's something I desperately want because it's awesome, but the creator is an evil person who will use any profits gained from legitimate sales to do evil work.  So I definitely won't buy it, because I don't want to give financial support to that terrible agenda; I might pirate it in that case.  But fuck, how often is that situation going to come up?  I can't think of many things that I absolutely MUST have, so in real life I could just as easily opt to do without whatever the thing is.  And most of the things out there whose sales definitely support things I disagree with turn out to be things that I don't want anyway.<br/><br/>4.  Yeah, sure, why not?  There's nothing wrong with people thinking about what they're buying before they lay their money down.  And any incentive that kind of consumer blowback creates for people to not be jerks with terrible opinions is probably a net good for society.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>i dont know, even though i like his work quite a bit, i would not want to own a Picasso or display prints of his work in my home, that guy was a total ass.</blockquote>\nHuh.  I wouldn't want to own an original Picasso because those should be in museums where everyone can see them, and also because I just don't want to own anything that's so expensive.  Prints are fine by me, though.<br/><br/>I suppose he <i>was</i> kind of a jerk, but so are a lot of people, many of whom are bigger jerks than he could ever hope to be.  And he was staunchly anti-fascist at a time when that wasn't an easy thing to be, so I have to give him points for that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286601/#Comment_286601" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T03:23:14+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  3:23AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There have been a couple of games I was pretty interested in but that weren't MUST BUY material where online conduct of the author made me not buy it.

In one case, I got rid of all my books by one author after seeing him act with complete disregard for others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286623/#Comment_286623" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T06:11:16+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  6:11AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2010 6:13AM by jenskot.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Who the author is and what their agenda is affects my choice to support them. <br/><br/>That said, it's not an on or off switch. but one factor.

Because much of the information I'll find is going to be on the designer's blog or a story-game post by it's designer, I might get a glimpse of that person's personal and ethical views. Most of the time, I've:<br/>\n<br/>\na) thought those views were awesome and totally clicked with mine (Rob Bohl, Joshua, Eero...) and that makes me more interested to find out about their games.<br/>\n<br/>\nb)not cared. Authors are human beings too, imperfect and beautiful. They're gonna be jerks sometimes. And creators can be highly emotional types carrying their heart on their sleeve. I'm fine with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm less likely to be fine with it if I'm the butt of their jerkitude, even by proxy (say, by making fun of an ideology I subscribe to, or being mean to a friend of mine). But it hasn't happened yet, and even if it did, a sincere apology or genuine retraction would do the trick.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the work itself is bigoted, I wouldn't want to buy it. But how could I know unless I read it? I usually buy games. I only file share person-to-person, and not even much of that. I take what I read on the Internet with a grain of salt. So, likely scenario:<br/>\n<br/>\na)I buy a game, and later find it's full of bigotry. Darn.<br/>\nb)A friend send it to me through file-sharing, and later find it's full of bigotry. Darn. Well, at least I didn't pay for it. However, I don't usually buy what I already have, so it's not anymore of a lost sale to the creator. Unless I was going to like the pdf so much I was going to buy the book, and now I'm not.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the creator's been long dead (the Picasso scenario) I'm probably going to dismiss any jerk views or behavior as "it was a different time" or eccentricity on the author's part.

Yes.  It's not cut and dried, but there's an influence.  I'm not aware of any authors whose views I find odious enough to consider not buying their work on those grounds whose work is of such high quality that I would consider buying it, but there are publishers and store owners that have triggered that response in me in the past.<br><br>2. This is complex, and it depends on the work and whether and how the views are apparent, and whether there's any artistic merit to the work.  <br><br>3.  No.  My views on unauthorized copying include the notion that if you use the work, you should pay the author what he asks for it somehow.  So if I download it, check it out, decide it's odious, and delete it -- that's the moral equivalent for me of picking it up in the store, flipping through it, and setting it back down in disgust.  If I download it and use it, I have an obligation to see that the author is compensated somehow.<br><br>4.  Yes.

In one of the "Stuff to Watch" threads there was this cute video of bears arguing over RPGs:<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_R1q8PEnM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_R1q8PEnM</a><br/><br/>But when it comes down to it, all that marketing speak that we see everywhere in our niches about "the long tail", "the new economy", and greater openness, visibility, and creating a connection between authors and the audience...<br/><br/>...that sword cuts both ways.<br/><br/>If the author pulls all the right levers and turns all the right knobs and I follow their blog or whatever, chances are that I'll have a connection with that author (even if it's ephemeral: Hey, it's how humans work emotionally. Just ask ELIZA). If that author seems like a nice person (regardless of political views or whatever; in my case the "highest virtue" that I look for is Empathy with others), then I'll be more inclined to check out their works. I'll look at them with rose-colored glasses, finding less flaws in their works (which may be riddled with them, see the 2002 version of Dread: Pandemonium for example).<br/><br/>If they're an asshole constantly, then I'll avoid their works. I might browse them (at the store, or on PDF or whatever), but there's so many games out there that I can easily "shut off" interest in an otherwise okay-looking game in order to play dozens of others. If I am presented with their work, I'll likely find the flaws all too easily.<br/><br/>If they were an asshole in the past, but show some redeeming qualities, I'll give them more consideration. People change, and I like that.<br/><br/>If they were a great person in the past, but turned into a bitter asshole, then I'll start to watch my wallet and find the flaws faster. Again, people change.<br/><br/>If I opened the book and found something awesome in it, chances are I'll start to reciprocally find things to respect in that author. Rarely happens, but it does happen sometimes. And if I end up actually liking the work or using it, I buy it, no question. I won't steal, even from people I don't like. I have bought works in this regard.<br/><br/>As much as I'd like to say "the work stands divorced from the creator of the work", in communities where I'm active it's not really the case. Again, it's that "using the internet/media to create a relationship between the creator and the audience" factor, and how it can be a double-edged sword if you're act like a piece of shit.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286640/#Comment_286640" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T06:48:52+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  6:48AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2010 6:52AM by Andy.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Addendum:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Epidiah Ravachol</cite>By some weird coincidence, the very few game designers who are real life giant walking bags of douche also happen to be terrifically bad at game design.

Theoretically, sure.  I'm quick to get bent out of shape over someone being evil.  If I knew about something like that, I'd stop buying their work.  But, I guess -- looking at my stuff, I'm not very choosy.  I like half(?) of the fiction of Orson Scott Card who is popularly vilified for his anti-gay stance.  And I disagree with his religion (as well as the others) and support full enfranchisement of homosexuals.  But I still read his work sometimes.  And I wouldn't give up Wagner just because he was a colossal prick, his work is too beautiful and I'm too selfish and it would be an empty gesture.  But still...I'd drop buying stuff from one of you guys if it came out that you beat up little girls or something.  *Shrug*\n<blockquote>2) Does it matter if the views are apparent in the work?</blockquote>I don't think so.  Anyone can write anything.  Right?\n<blockquote>3) Are you more likely to pirate a work you want by an author you don't like so as not to provide support?</blockquote>Maybe.

I spawned a thread!<br/><br/>Actual play, again.<br/><br/>Let's start with the book I won't name. I read it. It is not a game in itself. I think the advice is, for the most part, pretty good. I can't unlearn that advice. When I read it, I thought the author was an ok person. Between the time where I read it and I could afford it, I realized otherwise. However, this thread did make me notice that it was still on the computer; an error that has now been corrected.<br/><br/>Once I don't like someone, I do tend to download their work, often, it seems, only to remember why I don't like them. One prolific and well-regarded game designer comes to mind. As far as I can tell, he seems to believe in evolutionary psychology and all the sexist crap associated with it, making him, for all intents and purposes for me, a sexist person. I tend to download his games, look through them and realize, yep, I have no interest in playing this, regardless of whether or not the rules are interesting, because his personal views shine through.<br/><br/>Art to me is a conversation between the audience and the artist, and guess what, I'm not into conversations with people I don't like.<br/><br/>Also note, I'm not depriving myself. There are currently in existence, so many cool RPGs that I don't have a problem with (even with my very strict standards), that I wouldn't be bored in my lifetime if a new one was never made.<br/><br/>To use the Polanski example, I don't watch his movies, but I'm not losing out because there are an incredible number of awesome movies in existence. I will die before having seen every awesome movie I want to see (even with my extremely strict standards about what I'll watch).<br/><br/>So, uh, yeah, I do pirate works by people I don't want to financially support, but the result is never permanent, the games disappear from my computer.<br/><br/>On the flip side, the only games I've purchased unseen (Annalise and Breaking the Ice (pdfs in both cases)), happened because the person designing it displayed values that made me want to buy from them (and the games also happened to work well for two, which is my preference).<br/><br/>As for the last question, in my dream world, people would not financially support artists who they believe are bad people. I am far from that world though considering entire countries believe that being a "great" artist gives one the right to rape. But, most days, I believe that people already do that, and that they just don't care about issues that don't personally affect them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286684/#Comment_286684" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T08:47:29+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  8:47AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb_R1q8PEnM" rel="nofollow">this</a> sums up my feelings on the subject.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286691/#Comment_286691" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T09:03:28+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  9:03AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2010 9:08AM by chearns.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha! That video sums up my feelings as well.<br/><br/>It's a video where the male voice is right, and the female voice is an idiot (which I can tell because they are written with the intent that I will agree with the male and disagree with the female). I hate those videos (I saw the one for the iPhone as well) because they are sexist.<br/><br/>However, interestingly enough, the viewpoints _are_ slightly gendered. Men are indeed encultured to be hugely dysfunctional when it comes to their emotions, so the male bear's insistence on quashing emotions for the sake of rationality and objectivity (as if those qualities actually existed) is pretty accurate. But the female bear's healthy interest in her emotions ends up being caricatured to the point of stupidity, I can only guess because these videos tend to be written by men for men.<br/><br/>It is an interesting space of privilege to be able to say that I don't have to care about the author's views. Not all of us have that luxury. Some people have to live in this world without being white straight men.<br/><br/>EDIT: I met Luke once and I called him on his being a jerk online. His response in person and over ensuing emails we had together has me thinking he's just got a shitty internet voice. Of course, being a jerk isn't in itself a reason for me personally to avoid someone's work, but I have to admit it's the rare jerk that doesn't also express sexist, racist or homophobia views at the same time. Luke's work has never been avoided by me (well, not for idealogical reasons).

If they include that trait in the tone, subject matter or materials of a game - that's a different issue.  If you're a racist, for example, that's your damage.  Keep it to yourself.

I actually wasn't making any normative recommendation whatsoever in my earlier post. But since you ask, what I'd advise is adjusting your consumer habits where you think that the adjustment has some chance of actually making a palpable <i>difference</i> to the world. Choosing not to buy somebody's game because he/she is an asshole is profoundly unlikely to make the relevant author any less of an asshole. But buying only five of the games you think look fun instead of ten, and contributing the rest of the money to a carefully researched charity (like <a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/" rel="nofollow">these</a> guys, say) is considerably more likely to do some positive good. <br/><br/>Most consumer activism, including the type that I take Tim to be asking about here, isn't engaged in with this sort of motive at the forefront.

However, sometimes you don't feel up to the effort of making the world a better place, yet, you're going to try not to make it <i>worse</i>.<br/><br/>I'm not so prompt to dismiss personal purity as petty or frivolous, either. For many people, myself included, this is an essential part of how we build and maintain our self-esteem. If I'm very pro-feminism (which I am), and believe So-and-so is a misogynist, yet I buy his game from him anyway because it's just damn good, I'll feel like I sold my principles for a RPG, I'll feel those principles must not be worth much to me after all.

Seems like one should play it safe and not be real to avoid causing offense, you know? This seems even more sad when you consider the utterly frivolous nature of Internet offense: people get a burr up their nose from what would barely register as a rigorous coffee table debate in any civilized company I've frequented in the real world. It's a hyper-correct culture we have here. Add the fact that most often this act of not buying comes up as a self-made boycott declaration from somebody who might or might not have had any buying intent anyway, and the whole idea starts to look like a petty rhetorical stunt that only has meaning as an ultimate condemnation of somebody; it seems like this personal boycott is not for yourself, but for the purpose of making the poor guy really feel sorry for pissing in your morning cereal.<br/><br/>My own stand on this sort of thing is that humility entails respect, and respect entails engagement. In civilized society I can sit down with somebody I disagree with, and I can enjoy the message he delivers when it is done skillfully. There is nothing wrong in enjoying Dave Sim's Cerebus, for example, even if you disagree with some of its many themes. This is doubly true even if you disagree with Dave Sim's personal views expressed outside the work: are those views really so awful that you feel a need to take away basic human courtesy from the man by treating him like a pariah? My rough experience is that it's more socially acceptable to display this sort of extreme close-mindedness (moral indignation one might term it) in the USA than it is here, which might account for why I see too much of this in the Internet. For my own part somebody like Sim is not even close to losing my basic respect for him as a thinking individual, and while I disagree with his worldview, I can still respect his work as worthy opposition and enjoy it as a window to the world and experiences of somebody who thinks differently from my own convictions; this is how civilization works.<br/><br/>(Dave Sim is a good example here because I consider him one of the greatest comics-creators ever even while having a basically opposite worldview to his. The narrative of Sim's descent from liberal humanism to Abrahamic, paternalistic fundamentalism is as chilling as it is engaging. My attitude towards the man and his works is not dissimilar to the way I view C.S. Lewis - as a believer in free society and culture engendered by free exchange of ideas I can appreciate the clarity and passion these men put into their art while still disagreeing vehemently with their beliefs and conclusions.)<br/><br/>This discussion concerns many different impulses, of course. One that I find sort of understandable is the idea that if you really dislike somebody, that dislike might rub off and affect your view of their work, too. That's just psychology, not much that can be done about it if it happens. I find that I can usually forgive people when I look at their art, though, so this is not a big deal for me. Even the most annoying game designers are at their best in work created with honesty and passion.<br/><br/>Another strand aside from simple distaste here is the idea of economical support for jerks. I don't buy into this argument - I'm not paying Sim for his views, I'm paying him for the delivery. In fact, what I'm paying him for is the wonderful service he does to an open cultural environment by giving a strong argument for the things he argues for in his art. Whether I agree or disagree is besides the point. Speaking as a customer of the culture industry, I'm not in it to pay people to agree with me. That's just a childish attitude, and one that leads to cliquish, partisan thinking instead of true communication. And I specifically don't want anybody to feel like they have to agree with me or I'll go off in a huff and refuse to consider their work ever again. Keep engaging the culture in meaningful and powerful ways and I'll keep listening, no matter what your opinion. With this attitude I foster a low-tension conversation culture where people can talk with me without having to worry about offending me accidentally in some extreme I-never-want-to-see-you-again manner.<br/><br/>(In respect to Brett's cross-post and because people get burrs up their nose in the Internet, let me state that a careful reading of the above should make it clear that I am not trying to make any guesses about anybody's intelligence or virtue, even should they disagree with me. I probably come closest in the part where I say that only buying art that agrees with you is childish; I think that this is a fair opinion to hold in the abstract, without trying to particularly pin this childishness on anybody.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_287001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287001/#Comment_287001" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-17T14:33:41+00:00" title="August 17, 2010  2:33PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>(In respect to Brett's cross-post and because people get burrs up their nose in the Internet, let me state that a careful reading of the above should make it clear that I am not trying to make any guesses about anybody's intelligence or virtue, even should they disagree with me.

For me, it's personal and it's not a political or philosophical thing. It's more like meeting someone who is a total asshat. The next time you hear about a party and you hear he's invited, it dampens your enthusiasm and it may put you on the fence or tip you over that fence on whether you'll go or not. If they are a sufficient asshat, you may say, "Screw that I don't want to be around that guy and I am not going."<br/><br/>Obviously that is not the best example, but when someone calls me and my friends idiots, and by that I mean directly, not in some way where he said something vague that I took offense to and took to mean that me and my friends were idiots but a rather plain, "You, the person I am having a conversation with right now, are an idiot." And so it makes it really hard to be interested or enthusiastic about any game this person has designed because of the impossibility to divorce their work from my interpersonal interactions with them.<br/><br/>For those who can, congratulations on achieving a bodhisattva-like or Spock-like level of detachment. I can't do this. If I won a radio contest to meet my favorite band and I showed up and they stood me up (this happened to a friend of mine) I would probably enjoy them less. If I went to a book signing for my favorite author and he or she brushed me off to sign and interact with someone more attractive, it'll sour my enjoyment of their books.<br/><br/>And there's a threshold beyond this that I think is unreasonable, but I can't just tell someone, "Well, you're wrong and you should like their stuff."

No mention of actual play at all.<br/><br/>That's so at odds with my personal philosophy of gaming, with what I regard as actually being the hobby, I questioned whether that designer's work could ever be useful to me.  <br/><br/>If their genuine view was that I was a consumer of product and the product was the printed book, whereas my view is that I'm a hobbyist whose play is enabled and facilitated by the published game, then our views are so disparate I struggle to see how that person's work could ever be of use to me.<br/><br/>It's comparable to if a designer said the point of an rpg is to kill things and level up.  I don't find that offensive, but I'd be surprised if what they produced were ever of any use to me.<br/><br/>So, I now don't buy books by that designer.  It's not a personal thing, I'm not offended or angry although I do find their view a bit depressing.  I just don't see how that attitude could lead to work that will benefit my table.<br/><br/>Personal attitude therefore now does impact me if it makes a statement about design ethos.  If the designer though just posts comments on his blog saying D-503 is a dick well I probably won't like that much but it won't stop me buying their new game if it looks cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287085/#Comment_287085" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T05:28:09+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  5:28AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Answering the actual questions:<br/><br/>1) Do the personal or political views of an author affect your purchasing habits? <br/><br/>As a rule, no, but see above.<br/><br/>2) Does it matter if the views are apparent in the work?<br/><br/>Only if by doing so they undermine the work.  <br/><br/>3) Are you more likely to pirate a work you want by an author you don't like so as not to provide support?<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>4) Should the author's views affect peoples' purchasing habits? <br/><br/>That's up to each person.

There was an indie game designer that I met at a con, and he came across to me in that meeting like a total and complete asshat, to the point that not only did I never want to talk to him again, I never wanted to read anything he wrote.  But at another con I found myself at a gaming table across from him, and he was not an asshat in that session - he was actually one of the people that brought the awesome.  Meanwhile, other people whose opinions I respect were telling me how wonderful his games were, which I found hard to believe, because I mean, he was a total asshat, right, so how good could they be?  And then at another con, I wound up hanging out with the cool people, and he was there, and we wound up talking again, and he was once again not an asshat.  And the one of his games I've read is actually seriously cool and complex and it's on my list of games that must be tried.<br/><br/>So I was very wrong, and it kept me away from good games.  This hurt me a lot more than it hurt that indie game designer.<br/><br/>(Indie game designer, if you realize who you are based on this description, I apologize.

Well, it was about movies rather than games, whether or not an actor's opinions or attitudes would influence your choices of film.<br/><br/>My comment was that I go to the movies to be entertained. What the actors are like in 'real life' is immaterial, it is the characters that they are portraying and the plotline that interests me. Now, if issuing dinner invitations, yes, I would be concerned about whether or not they happened to be people I thought I'd get along with, but going to see someone give a performance, it's the performance that's important not the performer. For that matter, I have friends who are performers, but who I never see perform because I don't care for their work... but to share a beer with, they are always welcome!<br/><br/>I take the same approach to games. Now if the GAME itself was built around a premise I didn't care for, then I'd be unlikely to buy or play it. But even if I happened to know that the author held an opinion very different to mine, I wouldn't care. He's as entitled to his opinions as I am to mine, however obnoxious I might think his views are (he probably has the same approach to my opinions in that case!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287289/#Comment_287289" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T13:34:31+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  1:34PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All reasons <i>not</i> to buy things are good reasons, no matter how insane or silly they are.

Eliot (for their anti-semitic leanings), but if I had to read or teach them in a class, I would recognize that their literary qualities are what are in discussion rather than their personal views.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287330/#Comment_287330" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T15:46:29+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  3:46PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>Also, you really couldn't imagine yourself in a situation where you'd made up your mind to give someone money in exchange for a game they made and you, given your understanding of it, loved.

Normal state = not to buy.  Great.  In the hypothetical you've transcended that state of normalcy into some kind of posthuman buying entity, albeit temporarily.  You're a thing intent on buying an object.  Let's call that object 'a game'.  (It strikes me that you in particular, Jason, might have some very strong internal mechanisms against buying things.  That's fine.  It's a hypothetical.  The "you" in this situation isn't quite the "you" in actuality).  The person that made the object you had set yourself to purchase is a dick.  Does that (ignoring all those inner voices saying "NO JASON DO NOT BUY ANYTHING") make you revert back to your normal non-buying-human state or can you ignore the dick-like nature of the Object Creator and press on into your transitory purchasing future?<br/><br/>I think we agree at the core - that not to buy a thing simply because the person making it isn't a thing we would do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287346/#Comment_287346" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T16:57:32+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  4:57PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>You can't put yourself in that hypothetical situation just long enough to participate in this conversation?</blockquote>\nFor the record, I believe he <i>was</i>.

When I have my Story Games Evangelist hat on at a trad con, if I talk up the games taking a "D&amp;D sucks, this game rocks" viewpoint -- well, there's something like a 90% chance that the person I'm talking to is there specifically for D&amp;D, and that's the kiss of death.  But if I take the approach of, "You know what D&amp;D is like.... try this shiny new thing!  It's different from D&amp;D!  It's not the same kind of fun as D&amp;D, it's different fun!" I'm likely to recruit a couple people.<br/><br/>It also works for space in my head.  I really *don't* like D&amp;D4.  But instead of getting all worked up about how so many people can be so stupid as to like a game I don't like, I just let it go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287551/#Comment_287551" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T11:38:32+00:00" title="August 19, 2010 11:38AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua: Is it that different from investing time, money, and effort in telling people that you just finished making something good?<br/><br/>I mean, I've tried a couple creative endeavors in the past.  Most often they break down when they hit the point where I understand the thing I'm working on and I need to get it into shape for someone else.  If they get that far, they hit the point where I really want to just put it out into the world and let people buy it -- and I do, and nobody buys it because I'm not out telling them how cool it is.  And that's a real sticking point for me -- I have no problem at all collaring people at cons and saying YOU MUST PLAY FIASCO, IT IS SO COOL! or YOU MUST PLAY REMEMBER TOMORROW, IT IS SO COOL! but somehow when I do that with something I've made, it feels really slimy and marketroid and egotistical.<br/><br/>(Note that I have not tried this with RPGs as a creative endeavor, so this is slightly hypothetical.

In fact, it's necessary, if that artist is going to grow and keep making new and interesting stuff. Sometimes you'll end up with a record or game that you don't enjoy nearly as much as, say, the last one. And if this continues, yeah, you should probably stop buying their stuff, because now they just don't make stuff you dig anymore.

If you don't do it habitually, you <em>don't know</em> what's involved. That's the point: only making the thing to its completion teaches you what's involved.

Of course decisions are based on superiority. I think Cuban food is better than American diner food. I think movies directed by Cronenberg are better than movies directed by Spielberg.

The more vanilla you are, the more likely you will be ignored. <br/><br/>You have to stand out to make an impact, which means for a lot of people to like you, there will also be a lot of people that don't like you. If that's the case, why be dishonest? It's a lot of extra work for probably nothing. At worst, if you really think being honest about a specific topic is going to be that much of a problem, then just don't say anything about that topic. But lying is just going to get you into trouble in the long run, it's a lot of work, will probably drain you emotionally, and it sucks. <br/><br/>Ultimately you aren't guaranteed success. I would rather be honest and fail, than be something I'm not with a tiny chance of success. I'm not advocating being stupid in your communications. You can be sensitive and polite while still being honest.
