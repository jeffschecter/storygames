On the first team there was <b>Cletus Jangles</b>, the tyrannous redneck mechanic (Eoin) and <b>Taylor Tyrone</b>, the cowardly male nurse (Me).  The second team included <b>Janey Swanson</b>, the deceitful environmentalist (Susan), <b>Nicole Marx</b>, the spineless housekeeper (Daniel) and <b>James Kaneda</b>, the brutal hacktivist (Joe).<br/><br/>I suggested that the <i>Objective </i>be set on \u201cthe rooftop of the Petronas towers, Kuala Lumpur\u201d and everyone agreed (this is where our teams ended up for the bloody finale). Team Vagabond started in Tokyo, while Team Magnum started in Addis Ababa. We then went through the <i>Checkpoints</i>, and it worked out like this\u2026<br/><br/>Team Vagabond Checkpoints<br/>\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013<br/>1) Wreck a bullet train<br/>2) Burn down a Shinto temple<br/>2) Kidnap the chief of security for the Petronas Towers<br/><br/>Team Magnum Checkpoints<br/>\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013<br/>1) Assassinate Mugabe<br/>2) Steal a wmd from Bangkok<br/>3) Terrorise Kuala Lumpur<br/><br/>Ouch.

I\u2019m not going to present the AP in that form or it\u2019d get confusing. Each team will have it\u2019s own tale told\u2026]<br/><br/>The game started <b>badly </b>for Team Vagabond. Immediately Eoin knocked over the <i>Heat </i>stack, toppling dice over the table and scoring us a result of \u201c<b>Hunters</b>\u201d.  Shit! The Adversary (everyone on Team Magnum) described how SWAT rained in off helicopters from above.  Before we\u2019d even got to try and wreck a bullet train we were already under heavy fire.<br/><br/>I took a <b>3 Star Felony</b>, rolled loads of dice and scored a massive success.  When you commit a Felony you need to narrate some murder, especially a 3 Star Felony.  It was bloody.  A lot of good men died that day.<br/><br/>We then struggled with clumsy roll after clumsy roll, took a few <i>Traumas</i>, and got some interesting <i>Flashbacks</i>.  We saw a flashback of Cletus as a young boy getting beaten by his dad for \u201cspending all his time with his nose buried in books,\u201d and got a glimpse of Taylor off his face on scag, getting a delivery of his wife\u2019s fingers cus he\u2019d ratted out the mob.<br/><br/>It was a catastrophic failure, we barely managed to complete our first Checkpoint, and had to commit Felony after Felony just so we could stay in the game.  Basically it was a blast.  Shallow, gruesome, amusing creativity.<br/><br/>As for Team Magnum...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243901/#Comment_243901" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-26T17:45:17+00:00" title="November 26, 2009  5:45PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2009 5:48PM by Sebastian.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Team Magnum started off slow.  Susan messed up a roll in trying to get to the airport, and scored a Complication, so we (me and Eoin) had to come up with an interesting challenge.  The Taxi Man told the team "Shortcut," and tried to deliver them to a local gang to be robbed.  There was brutality, hijacking and so on, and the team made it to Mugabe's residence in Zimbabwe.  Suffice is to say, Mugabe was no longer the "head" of state at the end of that meeting (Bwa ha!).<br/><br/>They'd achieved their first Checkpoint.<br/><br/>Despite all our egging on and taunts, Team Magnum were able to complete the remainder of their Checkpoints quickly.  They stole some weaponised anthrax from Bangkok (?), went on TV in Malaysia and held Kuala Lumpur for ransom.  They demanded to be taken to the rooftop of the Petronas Towers.  Objective achieved.<br/><br/><b>Finale</b><br/>-------------------------------------<br/>It was a straight fight out in the finale, three against two, and we were terribly wounded.  Myself and Eoin had to throw <i>Shotguns </i>(that's when you use your Off-Hand to bowl the dice and you bowl two dice at the same time: very, very clumsy).<br/><br/>No need to get into the details.  Suffice is to say, Team Vagabond were taken care of efficiently.  All of Team Magnum survived, and we cut to the <i>Epilogue</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243904/#Comment_243904" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-26T17:55:37+00:00" title="November 26, 2009  5:55PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 26, 2009 5:56PM by Sebastian.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thoughts?<br/><br/>Myself and Eoin could have used our Victory Points more cleverly, maybe to buy some more co-operation or to hinder the weaker players on the other team.  Instead, we committed shit loads of Felonies, thereby increasing the risk when we eventually scored a Fail.  It quickly escalated into Traumas then, and once we ran out of Felonies we were screwed.<br/><br/>Although I originally intended Hell for Leather as a dark, broody query into the traumas of criminal fiction, I made the opposite.  A gut bursting, skull popping spectacle, to be enjoyed with beer and crisps.<br/><br/>As I mentioned on the Collective Endeavour,\n<blockquote>My playtesters enjoy it, even though I feel like I've somehow bent myself over and given myself one from behind. I suppose it's like the moment when a scriptwriter watches his tender adolescent love scene turned into a violent, mega lesbian fuck fest. It's not what you planned on, but by god it's entertaining.</blockquote>\nAll the best,<br/><br/>Sebastian<br/>Cobweb Games                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
