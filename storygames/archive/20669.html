My friend Mark threw out a few ideas, and I threw out a few ideas, and it quickly became clear that we were not on the same page.  I found some of his proposed character roles and abilities a bit implausible or outright nonsensical; at the same time, he found some of my ideas a bit uninspiring or outright no fun.  As we were talking through our reactions and trying to figure out where we could find common ground, we had this exchange:\n<blockquote>Dave: "It probably makes the most sense that in a small community's desperate struggle for survival, authority would get centralized.  So I think the Military Strategist should still report to the Leader, rather than being able to just declare strategic matters."<br/><br/>Mark: "Well, I'm going for that classic general type character who's reading the field and making the high-pressure calls."<br/><br/>Dave: "Oh, wait, this is a character type from fiction?"<br/><br/>Mark: "Yeah.  I think it's a perfect fit in our post-apocalypse."<br/><br/>Dave: "Oh!  See, I was going at this from, like, what would this be like in real life, and not really thinking in terms of movies or books and stuff."</blockquote>\nAnd then everything became clear.  <br/><br/>We agreed that Mark's take was more apt for this particular game, so I stopped trying to envision how everything worked and what would most likely happen, and just asked for Mark and others to fill in the blanks for certain fictional references so I could understand their appeal and better contribute.  We wound up defining some very fun and flavorful character types to run around being various sorts of awesome in our zombie hell.<br/><br/>I know it's not news that gamers can vary in taste and orientation, and that "from my favorite movie" and "from my knowledge of the real world" are two examples.  Even so, I thought it was kind of an eye-opener that Mark and I, two guys with lots of experience communicating game content to groups, wound up in a bit of a slog, and that that slog wound up being resolved by a very simple recognition.<br/><br/>"Are we working from fiction or from life here?"<br/><br/>So, that's one more for the toolkit.  I figure that asking that question will come in handy in the future.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453810/#Comment_453810" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-12T05:54:12+00:00" title="June 12, 2016  5:54AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But\u2026 seems to me that this is just one more thing to have strife over.<br/>Your disagreement was over the leader role.

I think most gamers will agree that they don't want something in the game that's so nonsensical they can't even imagine it, just as most gamers will agree that a good reference point, fictional or otherwise, can help them imagine stuff.  Mark and I just needed to communicate what route we'd take to imagining stuff.  Once we did, there was no problem.<br/><br/>I think there's a lot we can learn from <i>some</i> fiction, but a lot of the popular, pulpy fiction that makes it into my gaming is a <i>terrible</i> place to look for how real people act (e.g. superhero movies).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">@Hasimir</a>, yeah, a game book or system which helps the group cohere on style is great!  <br/><br/>As for "realism", I completely disagree that the label is meaningless, and that its historical use as a value judgment is any reason to abandon it.  <br/><br/>Mark and I were both searching for <i>orientation</i>.  When I'm making decisions about who my character is and what he does, what defines my common sense?  Should I be responding to situations with the knowledge and experience and burdens of a regular person desperate to survive?  Or should I be responding like an action movie hero?  Neither is better or worse for gaming fun, but I think we can all agree which is more realistic and which is more fiction-based.  I don't think we should be judging play by "is this realistic?", but I do think "realism" is a viable (and fun, to my taste) route to orientation in how to play a given game.<br/><br/>Having said that, I'll also opine that, once everyone's oriented enough to engage with play on the same page, it does help to be flexible.  Sometimes the GM gets a few details of airlocks wrong like <a href="/forums/profile/Paul88">@Paul88</a>, and as long as it doesn't ruin our ability to orient ourselves toward play, we should probably just roll with it for the sake of a fun encounter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453817/#Comment_453817" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-12T17:07:38+00:00" title="June 12, 2016  5:07PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If you ask me, what you individuated is a false dichotomy.<br/>What you are producing at the table is fiction.<br/>For everyone except yourself "my knowledge of the real world" <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>is</i></span></b> fiction.</blockquote>\nOK, this resonates with me, this is kinda what I feel too.\n<blockquote>I think there's a lot we can learn from <i>some</i> fiction, but a lot of the popular, pulpy fiction that makes it into my gaming is a <i>terrible</i> place to look for how real people act (e.g. superhero movies).</blockquote>\nTo me, the situation is like a chance to try different ways to act.

In my experience it seems like <i>how</i> the group and GM <i>apply</i> the rules is a huge part of the equation, though.  When the player wants his character to jump off the speeding motorcycle, do we say, "Cool, that's an athletic move that works all the time in action movies, so roll your Athletics to pull it off without a hitch!" or do we say, "That would probably kill you in real life, so roll Toughness to come away with only a few broken bones and a concussion"?  The rules for testing Athletics and Toughness can be really solid but the group still needs to agree on what fiction maps to which rules-use.  As a player, I want to know whether cinematic action stunts are going to be arbitrated like "cool!" or like "suicide!" before I start trying them.<br/><br/>Again, I'm not saying this life/fiction thing is hard to resolve!  Just pointing out that it's possible to lose track, so checking in can be handy.<br/><br/>I also think it's interesting how far apart Mark and I started.  It never occurred to him that I'd be thinking through zombie apocalypse details like, "If I were really there, what would I expect?" rather than conjuring up zombie movies I've seen.

My view of "real life" could be very different from yours, especially when we're play-pretending about things neither of us has experienced.

We learn through creating fiction, so we can put things in a context. <br/><br/>Further on, all our empiric knowledge of the world is also just how we perceive things - both by our senses and by our judgement. A Swedish racist is looking at the world through a different lens than a Tibetan monk.<br/><br/>If we talked a common objective language, then we would be able to perceive things in the same way, but we don't. Math is usually looked at as something objective, but it's still colored by how we perceive things. Euclidean math (ex. sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180\xba) isn't always true. Euclid formed these mathematical formulas based on a flat surface (the Earth) but we know now that the Earth isn't flat, it's round, and therefor the sum of all the angels can exceed 180\xba.

It's not really a metric of what's required or desired, just a constraint on what's allowed, and a fuzzy constraint at that, until further specified.<br/><br/>A long argument with Mark about what a post-apocalyptic general would <i>really</i> do would have been pretty stupid.<br/><br/>That wasn't our issue at all, though.  Neither one of us knows the answer to that question, and we were aware of that.  The issue was <i>how</i> we were going to <i>decide</i> what a post-apocalyptic general does.  And that wound up being a hint about how we were going to decide <i>everything</i>.<br/><br/>When I'm playing my character, can I work from my life experience or can't I?  "We're not going to reason out what would most likely happen in this scenario; instead we're aiming for genre satisfaction," is a pretty good hint that I can't.  Or, well, I always <i>can</i>, but it doesn't sound like a great idea here.  I'm much better served thinking in zombie movie terms.<br/><br/>Contrast this to when I run games which are not emulating particular fiction, and part of my pitch is "arbitration won't violate real-world physics" and "play your characters as real people".  Even though the game is about supernatural mystery, play unfolds <i>very</i> differently than if I were telling players "think Indiana Jones!" or something.<br/><br/>The reason I thought "Are we working from fiction or from life here?" was worth sharing here was because it helped Mark and I resolve our disconnect very efficiently.  <br/><br/>You can have a celebration of zombie apocalypse movies, or a "what would happen" zombie apocalypse thought experiment, or somewhere in between, and I don't think "What sort of fiction?" is inherently useful language for sorting that out.  I'd guess that our focus on the "what" -- zombies, apocalypses -- actually contributed to our initial failure to address the "how".  So, I'd say, if you really want to talk solely in fiction terms, try to be thorough and cover how players can/should orient themselves.<br/><br/>"Hey Dave, let's do a zombie apocalypse, with lots of gritty situations but also lots of over-the-top action and larger-than-life characters, more of an action movie ethos than digging into the details of regular people logistics and psychology," would be just fine.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453848/#Comment_453848" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-14T05:45:55+00:00" title="June 14, 2016  5:45AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2016 5:47AM by David_Berg.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't resist the bait:\n<blockquote>ALL you imagine (or even remember!) in your head, ALL of it is <b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">fiction</span></i></b>.</blockquote>\nI think this can be equally true at and away from the gaming table.  :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453858/#Comment_453858" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-14T15:40:06+00:00" title="June 14, 2016  3:40PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We usually call this "setting-logic", as in "what makes sense in this setting". Our groups tastes are somewhat similar and we have learned to adapt easily to different setting-logics. When we go for the D&amp;D feeling, anime-like physics only work when spells or other supernatural effects are involved. When things are more old-school oriented, real-world logic is more used, and so.<br/><br/>The process to detect and act according to one or another is internalized for us now, but it can be brought up easily by asking the group which kind of setting-logic is going to be used. It can be real-world, it can be narrative from X genre, whatever. But as long as it's clear and familiar for everyone, it becomes part of the unspoken rules to use it as a guide.<br/><br/>In some cases, when not everyone is familiar with this set of rulings, the most versed person on the table acts as a ruleslawyer, but then it's also expected from that person to be the facilitator, to be quite clear about the setting logic, to not expect everyone to know everything about it and to transport us into the world where this logic works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453864/#Comment_453864" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-15T13:22:32+00:00" title="June 15, 2016  1:22PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The issue was how we were going to decide what a post-apocalyptic general does.

But I find myself really really nodding along with Hasimir this time;<br/>It's like if someone says "Here is how I think this would work, log as a boat, and here's why". That's great. And yes, examples from when you went fishing with Uncle Jonah trump examples from some HBO show.<br/><br/>So I think that's a couple of things that strike me with David's original example:<br/><br/>\u2022 I have a hard time imagining myself saying "No, we deliberately want to emulate fiction <em>even when</em>, as fiction often does, we <em>know</em> the fiction contradicts reality." It was one of the things that always bugged me with GURPS bevy of "cinematic" options. Like, I like cool action too but I don't want to be reminded that it's completely unrealistic. I don't pretend that I'm a screenwriter or actor on the set of a horror movie, I pretend that I'm chased by vampires through the woods.<br/>\u2022 I see "Oh, you're thinking of how it works in <em>movies</em>. I was grounded in my thorough psychological research of human leadership in disaster situations. OK, then, I'll play along with you." as a little patronizing maybe? If you have the thorough psychological research, by all means, bake that into the game mechanically or premise-wise or teach us about it. Fiction, which RPG ultimately is, sometimes becomes even better when informed by reality. David is one of my very favorite posters on here but here is one situation where I actually would've been upset if I had been the other player.<br/>\u2022 I see it as "Not only did you find my character roles and abilities implausible and nonsensical, you had to rub it in by saying it was only a movie thing."<br/><br/>Here is what I love about Archipelago. It sucks when I get a "try it another way" card thrown at me, but it's the most respectful way I can imagine someone saying that they find my abilities implausible, and I acquiesce and try to rethink. Having someone say "Oh, you're doing a <em>movie</em> thing, now I get it, ok, go on, then", that'll likely sour me on the whole thing.<br/><br/>It's like when I'm trying to sing beautifully and someone says "Oh, you're going for the tortured cat thing, I get it, great job, carry on then".

The only wrong part for me about "try it another way" is that it's still <span style="text-decoration: underline;">blocking</span> which is why we often feel a bit bad/frustrated by it. <br/><br/>It's a ton of times better to offer the player another way to get exactly the same thing they want, that makes more sense for you. So the first step is to identify what does the player want. <br/><br/><i>Is it knowing more about the obstacle?</i> then either as a player or GM you can suggest another approach that seems more reasonable, and as a GM you can give them for free that their character realizes that approach is undoable because X and stright goes to try another approach that gives them the information they were searching for.<br/><br/><i>Is is dealing directly with the obstacle?</i> then again, let them know what their character notices and thinks according to the setting logic and how would they exactly perform a direct approach using the setting-logic. And of course you've gotta explain things before making them effective and/or before asking for any rolls. Because <br/><br/><i>Is it dealing indirectly with the obstacle?</i> since this one is more tricky you need to either figure out how to translate their approach into the current setting-logic or tell them what their character would think of that approach given the common sense of this world logic-wise.<br/><br/>All these suggestions are also meant to inform the players about the logic you're using. Like, if you see the GM use real-world logic, narrative swashbuckler logic, anime-like logic, etc, it's easier to figure out which one is currently being use. Like, if we were suddenly transported to a world where those sets of fictional rules apply we would notice not because somebody told us, but because things will start following that line of logic. Then we would put 2 and 2 together and start using that set of rules naturally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453893/#Comment_453893" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-16T17:09:48+00:00" title="June 16, 2016  5:09PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want there to only be one logic!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453897/#Comment_453897" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-16T17:46:24+00:00" title="June 16, 2016  5:46PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2016 5:49PM by David_Berg.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see that my actual play example is really pretty crappy for illustrating what I wanted to to illustrate.  Well, except for the part where, "Life or fiction?" <i>worked perfectly</i>, but even that doesn't seem to be very convincing to many respondents.  I think there's a lot of context missing from my account, so here, maybe this will help:<br/><br/>Mark and I are friends.  We've played a lot of sessions of a lot of games together.  We both GM.  We both facilitate.  We both play with friends.  We both play with strangers.  We both tinker with game design.  We both talk about roleplaying for fun.  Our tastes are very similar at times and very different at other times.  We've played games that were explicitly about emulating media, such as World Wide Wrestling, where Mark actually had to tell me things about wrestling so I could play it right.  We've also played games with an explicit ethos of realistic consequences for character actions.  So there was <i>zero, absolutely none, 0%, nada</i>, value judgment going on in our discussion of realism.  "Oh, you're working from <i>fiction!</i>" was not a criticism, it was not condescending, it was an observation that Mark I were both <i>happy</i> to have communicated once we did so.<br/><br/>I don't think "realistic" is somehow "best".  I don't think "from life" is the "best" play mode.  I do personally <i>like</i> them a lot, but that's not the same thing.  I played World Wide Wrestling, for Pete's sake!  And I enjoyed it a lot.  I just needed some grounding on <i>how</i> to enjoy it.<br/><br/>That was the issue for me and Mark.  Am I going to enjoy this like WWW, or am I going to enjoy this like Delve, or somewhere in between?<br/><br/>Perhaps our hobby is too fraught with dysfunctional "realism" baggage to have a conversation which includes that term.  For that reason, my example with the military strategist is a pretty terrible example.  Although the <i>point</i> was "How do we figure out what this role would be?", and my reasoning from life was a proposed answer, and my initial disagreement with Mark was the same sort of workshopping that goes on in most creative collaborations, I can see that the "let's try my more realistic idea over your less realistic one" dynamic is <i>super</i> distracting.  Because, y'know, we've all seen the guy who says "that's not realistic" just to get his own way, often at the expense of group fun, and apparently that image is impossible to shake no matter how many times I clarify.  (Unless I finally found the right wording in this post?  Fingers crossed!)<br/><br/>An easier example to discuss would look something like this:\n<blockquote>Mark: "The zombies on the other side of the escalator open fire!"<br/><br/>Dave: "I dive for cover!  I didn't know zombies could wield guns, and I'm kinda freaking out!  Do I have to roll to keep my wits about me?"<br/><br/>Rohit: "I kick my skateboard up onto the railing and fly by the zombies on my back, shooting them as I go!"<br/><br/>Mark: "Awesome, Rohit.  Roll to hit with Advantage!"<br/><br/>Dave: "Wait, what?  That sounds super hard and super dangerous."<br/><br/>Mark: "Yeah, but Rohit's character is badass.  You all are."<br/><br/>Dave: "Oh, wait, should I be deciding what my guy does like he's an action movie character, rather than thinking through what I'd do if I were there in real life?  Working from fiction rather than from life?"<br/><br/>Mark: "Yes!"<br/><br/>Rohit: "Obviously.  You can't use my skateboard trick, though!"</blockquote>\nDoes that help?<br/><br/>Separately, I get the vague sense that maybe some people posting here don't buy that "working from life" is actually a thing.  To cherry-pick one comment (sorry Simon, I'm aware this wasn't your main point, and I do agree with the rest of your post):\n<blockquote>I guess you could phrase it as "fiction" vs. "real life", but it seems to me it's just different genres. There's plenty of fiction that's closer to your spelunking than to the Avengers.</blockquote>No there isn't.  That fiction is just a thing I can watch or read.  My spelunking is something I <i>did</i>.<br/><br/>Roleplaying is also a thing I do.  Thinking of it solely in relation to things I've watched or read is really unappealing to me.  I've gotten great mileage out of doing the opposite.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453899/#Comment_453899" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-16T18:34:04+00:00" title="June 16, 2016  6:34PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I can see that the "let's try my more realistic idea over your less realistic one" dynamic is <i>super</i> distracting.</blockquote>\nYeah, I really got hung up on it.\n<blockquote>Dave: "Oh, wait, should I be deciding what my guy does like he's an action movie character, rather than thinking through what I'd do if I were there in real life?

It was just a verboten topic. It was intented to create more experiences from their urban exploration, larping, and dancing or other things you actually did or someone you know did.<br/><br/>And they did try out some of those wild parkour stunts, one of them (the one who told me about the rule) had his pelvis shattered from swinging into a phone boot and then falling flat on his back. Some tourists came up to him as he lay there and they asked him if he was OK.

Rohit's not going to do that skateboard move if it's going to shatter his pelvis like it would in real life; he's going to do it if it actually works like in action movies.  He needs to know what logic of consequence we're using before he can decide whether to skate or not to skate.<br/><br/>I think a lot of the frustration that comes up in RPG land around "realism" is actually about inconsistent logic of consequences.  The GM who arbitrates one action based on physics probability and another action based on thinking it sounded cool can be tough to recover from.\n<blockquote>No talking about things you've seen in fiction, whether movies, films or books. It was just a verboten topic. It was intented to create more experiences from their urban exploration, larping, and dancing or other things you actually did or someone you know did.</blockquote>I would love to do that for a bit.<br/><br/>And then, some other time, I'd also like to geek out about favorite fiction.<br/><br/>Having different niches for different games has been important to me.  I think most of the most dissatisfied roleplayers I know are the ones who really want <i>this game</i> they're playing <i>right now</i> to fulfill <i>all</i> their RPG desires.  Perhaps I am lucky that some of my RPG desires are obviously mutually contradictory; I can't <i>possibly</i> have it all at once, so I'm not tempted to try.<br/><br/>That might have been my biggest eye-opener from all the indie RPG stuff I discovered a decade ago -- "this is <i>also</i> cool, but <i>different</i>".  My desire to play stuff like Delve was not lessened, but it was clarified to be "one particular thing" rather than the definition of "fun roleplaying".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453909/#Comment_453909" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-17T01:31:28+00:00" title="June 17, 2016  1:31AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those two quotes from me were not meant to be put together                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453910/#Comment_453910" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-17T02:15:58+00:00" title="June 17, 2016  2:15AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I get the resistance to ratifying a fiction-oriented viewpoint; after thirty odd fuckin years of calling to self-satisfied pulp action fantasy novels, Tolkien's lists of things in people's backpacks and Anne Rice's dirty books, it feels like a huge step forward to just portray a perceived-as-real being, even or perhaps especially if you're just playing yourself. <br/><br/>But I think the objection also answers itself. There are so many unexplored areas of fiction that RPGs remain stolidly ignorant of  that we could play forever and never cross them all.  <br/><br/>(Hey, here's a list, pick the thing from the list that gamers would  consider the least "cinematic":<br/><br/>* A session of Feng Shui where we fight a hundred ninja<br/>* A Mike Hammer novel where he gets in a car chase while shooting people<br/>* An episode of "24" where Jack Bauer runs into a mall with a gun<br/>* An episode of the radio show "The Adventures of Sam Spade" where Sam Spade fistfights in an airship<br/>* Tarkovsky's <i>Andrei Rublev</i> )<br/><br/>It's even worse than we think, though.

If I look at you across the table and say, in all seriousness, that all virtue is compromised in the presence of the profane, and man's inhumanity is a full expression of his separation from God, and you say, in all seriousness, that religion is a mental disorder, then we're both calling to something within humanity we see as absolutely real, but we have incompatible views over what would happen (and worse, what it means). There are as many ways to see the world as there are people. Adding in fictional points of view is like adding the negative numbers to the set of counting numbers - it's still infinite and it's just as infinite as it was before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453937/#Comment_453937" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-17T17:15:36+00:00" title="June 17, 2016  5:15PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm also okey using movies or literature references to help everyone get quickly the mood, setting-logic or detail level.

As long as you and Bill and I can agree that the dungeon guard, having obvious incentives to guard his gold and fight from advantageous position, won't simply do the opposite for our adventuring party's convenience (the way an action movie mook would), then we're pretty well set.<br/><br/>Beyond that, it's on us as responsible participants not to waste the group's time with unnecessary arguments over relative likelihood.  (In my experience, most "realism" hiccups are actually <i>that</i>.)  <br/><br/>"Let's be real," when correctly parsed as, "Let's stay plausible," is extremely broad when it comes to humans.  Human behavior is so varied that the range of it which is "likely enough to accept" is enormous*.  It's not <i>infinite</i>, though, and the excluded portion is often the important one.<br/><br/>*Just to connect this back to my opening post:  Rather than revealing that we weren't on the same page, my exchange with Mark could instead have gone like this:\n<blockquote>Dave: "It probably makes the most sense that in a small community's desperate struggle for survival, authority would get centralized.

Cool."  (In my own head: "My idea still seems slightly more <i>likely</i> to me, but now I can envision Mark's too, so no need to mess with it.")

I have definitely seen some approaches to gaming which blur that line dramatically (perhaps this is Sandra's approach with her group?), however.<br/><br/>I think a big part of it is all about how we judge contributions to the imaginary space. The first - at least for me - is a matter of, "Hey, this <i>feels</i> right, and, also, it gives me stuff to build on later, makes me excited about the content of the game." The second is more open to, "Hey, I don't <i>know</i> how this would go. Let's talk it out, or do some research to find out."<br/><br/>Perhaps ironically, the actual process of playing can be quite the opposite - more "in my head" in the fiction-emulation paradigm and more "in my character's head" for the "let's make it real".<br/><br/>I think the distinction comes up especially when things break down a little bit in play, and the group tries to fix them.<br/><br/>For instance, let's say a character does something strange. Maybe the player who is acting out that character's role is new, and missed some background, so they made a strange decision. Or a game mechanic or random roll (e.g. a Reaction roll) has created something which seems strange and inexplicable.<br/><br/>In that situation, how does the group attempt to judge this action and find a way forward, back into the flow of the game?<br/><br/>Sometimes it might be a question of, "Well, that doesn't really make sense based on what we know, but it would make the character into a great villain in the next part of this story - do you guys like that twist? Ok, then, let's move ahead - we can figure out why this happened later, or just ignore it because we all like this new dramatic direction so much."<br/><br/>At other times, we might say, "Well, perhaps this means we don't know something about the character, or their circumstances. Let's look for some interesting justifications or simply accept that something is wrong here, and that we'll find out why later."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454460/#Comment_454460" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-01T20:46:11+00:00" title="July  1, 2016  8:46PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All of the various responses to your question, Paul, that I could think of, involves me repeating myself <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>Like they're in a big dam now in our game and it's completely unrealistic with flying brains and screaming wizards.
