Huh....)<br/><br/>Long story short, my life has been way too hectic for me to commit to any Gamestorm activities this year, so you won't see me there.<br/><br/>But if any of you want to get out of The Couv or away from your hotel and join me for a meal/drink/conversation in Stumptown on Thursday or Friday night, especially you folks coming from out of town, drop me a whisper.  Lot of great food in Portland - Vancouver not so much.  Maybe you've already got a plan with a half-dozen other locals - if so, let me know where the party is!
