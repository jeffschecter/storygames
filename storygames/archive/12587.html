In this light, there are a lot of "designers" who are simply cobbling a few old and new parts together, or even just veneering a new surface on the same old mechanical underpinnings. No real innovation in what they are doing, and they aren't really seeking to change the gaming world, but they're a solid presence keeping traditional gaming alive (or maybe they think they are desperately trying to prevent it's inevitable demise).<br/><br/>I guess that's probably where the Old School Renaissance crowd comes in. Instead of reaching out to new players, they're trying to lure back in the old players.<br/><br/>It's not the most effective business model, but it takes less risk than forging new paths through the creative wilderness. It's effectively saying, we can't really compete with the advertising juggernaut that is WotC, but we'll be there when people want something more, or something a bit different.<br/><br/>The irony is that many of these games and gaming accessories seem to be turning a decent income for their creators. While the true innovators are trying to work out why the hobby isn't following their lead...<br/><br/>...maybe I'm just editorialising too much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282717/#Comment_282717" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-23T21:06:47+00:00" title="July 23, 2010  9:06PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I guess that's probably where the Old School Renaissance crowd comes in.

Much like the Indie crowd, the OSR folk feel their preferred style of play is not being served by the "mainstream" industry, and are looking to create products for their own use and to bring their style of gaming to others who have never experienced it, both younger gamers, and those who have never gamed.

I've got a friend who bought the 3.5 PHB hoping to play D&amp;D but he never got the chance. Unlike the original launch of the 3e PHB, it didn't have all the info necessary to play right in it.This is why I'm glad that the Red Box is coming back (despite the evident pull towards old school players).<br/><br/>Interestingly, WW made a rather serious error in my view with nWoD LARP. I played a nMage game, and character creation was exactly like a tabletop game, to the point that I thought the group just wanted to use the new rules with LARP and WW hadn't supported it yet. That's just not that feasible, and I think they won't be drawing in as many new players anymore.<br/><br/>Something I also notice is that there isn't a well supported presence of RPGs in major stores. At my local chapters there is an incomplete line of 4e books, particularly no DMG or MM. I suppose this is part of why essentials is launching, but either the major stores are stopping bringing in new products or they've just gone for a model where they continue supporting existing customers of RPG products.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282739/#Comment_282739" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-24T10:34:44+00:00" title="July 24, 2010 10:34AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>It is possible that a lot of talk on the subject is in the air right now because some gaming blogs throw "blog carnivals" and all blog on a given subject now and again.</blockquote>\nThat had me laughing for like 30 minutes <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>I'm not sure why I find it so funny.

But currently, WotC is the only publisher equipped to support the regular creation of new GMs. The fact that anyone who might possibly be interested, even just casually, in trying out this RPG thing, knows that on any given Weds night they can go by the shop and drop into a game where we're specifically ready to help new players learn, that's a huge thing that no one else has been able to manage on a national scale, with the possible exception of GW, whose product is similar but not nearly as complex as an RPG. <br/><br/>I know the Story Games community has a complicated and occasionally ambivalent relationship with game retailers, but is is one place where the receptive and progressive stores can hopefully meet the DIY crowd halfway and serve as incubators for new players. If you want NEW people coming into the hobby, you need a transition zone between the kinds of social activity they're used to and the rarified space of dedicated gamers. Good community stores, and less regularly, large-scale venues like ComiCon, PAX, etc, are the places that can happen.<br/><br/>-Jim Crocker                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282744/#Comment_282744" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-24T11:10:02+00:00" title="July 24, 2010 11:10AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the ambivalent relationship to game retailers has to do with often being overly specialised. I remember a store that only did Magic (and a few other CCGs) and D&amp;D (and Rifts occasionally). It wasn't financially viable. The only store that still has a solid RPG support locally is one that focuses on board games. Comic stores seem to be dwindling away with RPG support, and even dedicated GW stores are closing down.<br/><br/>That's where possibly FFG has something going with WHFRP3E - it's 2-4 players by default which is a bit small, but everything is in one box for everyone, and there's much less writing down character info than with traditional RPGs, so aside from the GM, starting and set up time is about the same as another board game. Also, since it's quite possible that board game stores are the most viable places for RPGs to be presented, making an RPG more board game like makes sense (and D&amp;D does this too with 4E, my girlfriend wanted to know what an RPG was like, and she kept asking if it was like a board game, it would have been much easier to be able to say yes).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282757/#Comment_282757" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-24T14:11:36+00:00" title="July 24, 2010  2:11PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the things that got me to check out indie RPGs in the first place was the notion of finding games more compelling to my friends who have never been into RPGs. I had come to accept that roleplaying just wasn't for some people (and that might still be true), but I now realize that it was more that trad games were my whole notion of what RPGs were, and that it's not for everybody. With indie games there is an explicit move to create all kinds of games for all kinds of tastes, which can only help the chances of finding something that people new to the hobby will enjoy (e.g. maybe your brother would find an OSR game awesome, while your sister might dig Sorceror, and your dad finds out he loves Fiasco). I haven't had much opportunity to put this into practice yet, but I'll be in a position to do so in the next couple of months.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Levi Kornelsen</cite><br/>A broader social move to "grow the hobby" might do very nicely.

On the one hand, if I sell through a retailer, I effectively lose the sale, making just a couple of dollars on a copy. On the other hand, if that sale is to someone who wouldn't have bought it otherwise <em>and</em> leads to a player bringing it to his home group, who gets excited about it and either talk about it on the Internet or buy their own copies, it's a net benefit. It's a core tenet of the indie RPG phenom that the best publicity for a game is enthusiastic players, after all, and stores can make enthusiastic players. I have no doubt that in-store play and sales are more effective overall than promotional materials, and they're <em>certainly</em> more cost effective \u2014\xa0if I print posters, for instance, I pay for them, rather than vice versa. And who gets excited about a poster, seriously? Jim's got a lot of posters in his store. They make a nice ambience, but I don't actually <em>see</em> them.

What I care about is increasing the odds that, if I want to play a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">niche</span> game, I'll be able to find someone who wants to."  And honestly, I only care about it if I'm not currently in a gaming group with 3-5 other people (more than 6 total is too much, less than 4 total is not quite enough).<br/><br/>The whole idea of "expanding the hobby" doesn't feel like it has anything at all to do with me:  I'm not financially or emotionally invested in how widespread gaming is, I just want to play in a regular game with a small group of friends and that's all.  If I don't have that, I worry about how to get one or two new people to join the group, and I stop there.  Think locally, act locally.<br/><br/>But I don't mind if other people care about that stuff.  I assume they've got good reasons to care, and I have absolutely no reason to wish them anything other than success.

On these terms, <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> is currently a very successful game and I don't believe we can ever hope for more.<br/><br/>This coming from someone who loved 3E in many ways and felt 4E was a great improvement, BTW.<br/><br/>Any potential for further growth, if that's what we're really after, we shouldn't expect to squeeze out of D&amp;D anymore, as we can't hope to squeeze one more drop of support out of "boys [<i>of all ages, and some girls</i>] who like their monsters and swords": we got  'em covered. We need to cater to new, "virgin" audiences. And, in pursue of that, a whole big paradigm shift is required. Maybe akin to what the videogame industry is undergoing with the whole "casual games" thing, I don't know.<br/>Whatever: what I know is that the independent games of today hint toward a number of new ways, design-wise and topic-wise. Some of those ways may prove feasible, some may reveal disastrous. Whether WotC want to go there at all depends on how willing they're to diversify, I suppose.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283189/#Comment_283189" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-27T20:11:26+00:00" title="July 27, 2010  8:11PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Now, the thing is, Shock: is directed not at D&amp;D players, but Hard and Social SF fans.

I'm asking how the minority that are interested in working with the micro-presses and self-publishers who aren't strictly self-indulgent vanity projects can do so, hopefully to some kind of mutual benefit? I really like the SG play style and would love to see a few dozen regional scenes like we have here in Western MA grow with the stores providing marketing support and play space and the creators providing content in an effort to each support gaming on a local basis. It's not something g that's going to be widely adopted, it'd by definition be a regional grass roots thing, but I think it's one of many ways the good and progressive shops can stay relevant as the marketplace changes while giving self-publishers a platform and some marketing weight they might not have while also working a 9-to-5.<br/><br/>(And as Josh says, good hybrid book/game and comics/game shops can help work some of those non-gamer customers for you...

The first video games that really created the market where people continued playing them and wanted more and more complex games were actually very simple. Pac-Man and Space Invaders are incredibly well known games with constant pop culture references, and they were incredibly simple games. They also had a lot of hardcore appeal with trying to get the highest score possible. Over time video games became very complex to the point that they needed entire tutorial levels (every Final Fantasy game now takes easily half an hour before you can start playing the game fully, while you got started right off the bat in FF1), and similarly with RPGs you have to spend hours or days reading through the book, making sure everyone else has too, then making characters and spending time preparing adventures (even if it's a pre-made one). There's a similar disinterest among most people to put that much time into video games as there is for RPGs, and it has to do with not having enough time.<br/><br/>For RPGs to draw new people in, they just have to go back to the way they were before, where 30 minutes was very long, rather than short, for character generation, and the rules were very simple. Simple casual games are putting iOS forward as the biggest competitor Nintendo has ever seen in the handheld market. People start with the simple games like Dizzypad and then occasionally move on to more complex or hardcore games. Those simple games that most people go for are no more complex than Pac-Man, but simply more polished. A game that's as simple as D&amp;D was, but more polished and with rules that make sense to people who don't come from a wargaming background would do the trick. It would also I think have to do something video games don't already do better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283944/#Comment_283944" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-01T18:43:44+00:00" title="August  1, 2010  6:43PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tried looking through the list of other posters to see if there was anyone else name Robin, and I didn't see it, so it really seems like it's directed at me.

I played the Mentzer Red Box DnD in junior high (1988) and we always made our characters at home before the game spending a lot of time on thinking them out.<br/>\nThe "old school by-the-book roll 6 times and go" experience, if it was even suggested in the book, was never how we experienced the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, I don't think half-to-one-hour of chargen is a significant barrier to entry, especially if chargen is also fun in and of itself. Getting people to even *consider* playing an rpg is harder, especially if that rpg looks complicated and seems to require playing for a looong time as a default assumption. People will try a boardgame because it's a one evening commitment but will balk at the suggestion of "this is the game we'll play for the next year or so, every tuesday".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284401/#Comment_284401" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T08:47:20+00:00" title="August  5, 2010  8:47AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafu</cite><cite>Posted By: migo</cite>For RPGs to draw new people in, they just have to go back to the way they were before, where 30 minutes was very long, rather than short, for character generation, and the rules were very simple.</blockquote>\nExcept RPGs were<i>never</i>like that, actually.

That said, I always made stats that averaged to weaker than the other players (I was good at some things and bad at others and otherwise average, e.g. 18, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14).  I think that was also the point that I realized that both D&amp;D and my play group were not giving me what I wanted from an RPG.

When saying "Basic D&amp;D was never a quick pick-up game", Raffaele was saying, "The way<i>we</i>played Basic D&amp;D was never quick and simple," which isn't necessarily the way the game was written.</blockquote>\nNope.* Independent from my own experience playing the game, I contend that, when put under unbiased scrutiny, <b>the game design itself</b> of "old D&amp;D" or its clones (old or new) does <b>not</b> present a low entry barrier to the novice player.<br/>Specifically, in regards to creating characters, I contend that the perception of such procedure as "quick" is an effect of selectively remembering only <b>parts</b> of said procedure as such. That's to say, it's a bias. While indubitably less daunting than GURPS or Third Edition D&amp;D (which is not to say much!), creating a character for play was in many ways a daunting task for the novice. Veterans automatized large chunks of it, of course, while a new entrant into an established group was often eased through the process by co-players tutoring him, but that's beyond the point and could, in fact, happen all the same with the most esoteric of rulesets.<br/>In general, I've been struggling long time with the "old school" mentality that older was simpler, even while I now agree that "simpler" is often better. While arguably simpler than their most outrageous direct derivatives (3E D&amp;D being an egregious offender, and 4E approaching it closely), "old school" RPGs only appear "simple" to the already RPG-conditioned mind of RPG enthusiasts. Mentzger/Moldvay Basic D&amp;D, which was deliberately designed to be a simplified and accessible version, still manages to be way more intricate and complex than so many later works; it's only a quick and simple pick-up game to dedicated hardcore D&amp;D-ists (which a majority of consummate roleplayers probably are).<br/><br/>* = Should I maybe add "Japan"? ^_^;                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284529/#Comment_284529" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T20:00:33+00:00" title="August  5, 2010  8:00PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Complex character creation isn't necessarily a barrier to entry.

Namely, to weed out low-commitment or overly self-indulgent players?<br/><br/>Got to say that my Old School experience is more like Rafe's. Yeah, if you already had internalized all the customs, knew how to pick equipment and just where to look everything up, and didn't care to fiddle with your stats, it could be fast. If you came at it cold, it was maddeningly opaque.<br/><br/>But I'm not sure that "pick up and play" is really the key to attracting new players that some think. I'm much more of the opinion that RPG culture, subject matter, and most importantly the vast amount of unwritten custom that surrounds "how to play" are the real barriers to entry. That, and I doubt the activity is really appealing to more than a small proportion of people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284539/#Comment_284539" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T22:40:00+00:00" title="August  5, 2010 10:40PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2010 10:41PM by Hans_c-o.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Again, fair enough, Raffaele. I'm not trying to say you're wrong, just that, looking at, <b>specifically</b>, Moldvay Basic (and no other) D&amp;D, it seems very quick to start-up. The only D&amp;D's I've played are 2 sessions of 4e and 3 sessions as GM of 3.5. In comparison to those, how they play and <i>read</i>, Moldvay Basic is incredibly simple, and I can easily imagine creating a character in it in less than 30 minutes (but then, I'm one who'd just pick basic equipment, except for maybe one standout weapon). But I suppose I've finally gotten out what I meant to say. As I said, I'm not trying to disprove you, but rather express my point of view from my experiences. I trust yours are valid as well! If you care to continue discussing the pick-up-and-play merits of Basic D&amp;D, I'll be happy to start another thread, as we've wandered far afield from this one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284567/#Comment_284567" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T02:01:51+00:00" title="August  6, 2010  2:01AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>Aren't those rather specifically<i>intended</i>as a barrier to entry?

Stop.<br/>- S/lay w/Me: choose 2 things from a couple of short list, say who you are and what you are searching for, stop.<br/>And I am sure other can list many, many games (even traditional ones) much more fast and simple for a novice player.<br/><br/>In the "old times", when I played Basic D&amp;D, the effect of many prospective players was evident: at the end of the character creation process they were bored, exhausted, and stopped making thoughtful decisions because they wanted to PLAY, finally...  and some times all this "work" really scared some people who refused to play.<br/><br/>But nostalgia of youth could make even AD&amp;D appear as a "slim and easy system", I suppose. (but the process takes time, it' for this reason that I think we are seeing the OSR only now...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284588/#Comment_284588" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T06:59:02+00:00" title="August  6, 2010  6:59AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2010 6:59AM by cwilbur.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            hans, I think where you're getting hung up is that while Basic D&amp;D offers a few apparently-simple choices, the ramifications of those choices are really important and not at all obvious.<br/><br/>So, sure, if you don't have strong opinions about what you want to play -- roll your stats, roll hit points, roll starting money, get your basic equipment, pick a spell if you need to, and go.<br/><br/>But each one of those choices has a lot of ramifications.  Suppose we're rolling 4d6, drop the lowest, and arrange to suit.  Well, the best place for your attribute scores depends on what class you want to be, so it's not simple.  Or, well, we could just roll 4d6, drop the lowest, in order, but then you have to choose your class based on your attributes, or despite your attributes, and both of those approaches have consequences later on.  Every one of those apparently simple choices has long-term ramifications. <br/><br/>So someone who knows the game, and who more importantly has already studied and understands all of these relationships, *can* create a character really quickly.  But if that player has the slightest inclination to ponder his options, you'll be well over half an hour.  And for a novice, there's a lot to understand, so if we're talking about barriers to entry, well, those barriers are pretty high.  I noticed that with D&amp;D, as with Magic later on, a lot of the new players came to the game not by reading the books and trying it, but by being recruited and taught the basics by other players.  And I can't think of many players for which this is not the case: that their introduction to roleplaying games came not because they picked up a book and read it, but because they sought out or were found by other roleplayers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12587/is-there-talk-about-growing-the-hobby-among-players-of-d-d" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12587/is-there-talk-about-growing-the-hobby-among-players-of-d-d" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12587/is-there-talk-about-growing-the-hobby-among-players-of-d-d/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12587%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12587%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
