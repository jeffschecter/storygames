<p>We got together at Andy K's place tonight for the third playtest session of Infected, my monster-movie RPG.  It's still pretty fresh &amp; raw in my mind right now so I thought I'd throw down some first impressions before sleepy time.</p>
<p>First off, it went really well.  The pacing was perhaps a bit off in the middle of the game, but in the start and in the finish, everything felt like I imagined it should feel.  That is, a nice, slow build-up in the first act and a great cacophony of high-action in the fourth act.</p>
<p>All of the issues from  the previous two playtests seemed pretty well sewn up.  The monster combat mechanism was much smoother and much more interesting.  The simple requirement of 'frame a scene' before rolling the dice had a tremendous, if not completely satisfying, effect on how the story of the game came down.  And the ramping-up of Weapons Dice and Will To Live points provided a MUCH greater amount of enjoyment on everyone' s part, even if the ramp-up was perhaps a tad high for the Weapons Dice.</p>
<p>For my playtesters who read here, I present the list of ideas that I may try to impliment for the next playtest session.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<h4>Despair Action - Scaled.</h4>
<p>The better you roll against an individual opponent, the more you take from them.  On a 1/2/3 scale like other WTL actions.  This means, if you're trying to Despair 3 other PCs, you can earn as many as 9 WTL!  The purpose here is to make Despair a very appealing option.  Not only is player vs. player conflict fun for everyone, but every Despair action is a boon to the GM, and should therefore be much more appealing to the individual than the Relax action is.</p>
<h4>GM Dice - One extra die.</h4>
<p>The players have access to way more dice than when I originally decided the GM gets two dice as a base.  The GM should be throttling any solo PCs and scaring the crap out of any PC duo.  PCs should only have the advanage in groups of 3 or more.</p>
<h4>Combat, Disadvantage - Gives the PC one Infection Point.</h4>
<p>I believe this rules mod will kill two birds with one stone.  First, it provides for more Infection on the table early on.  An obvous issue from tonight's game.  Second, it keeps that first Disadvantage result from being a tad boring.  Also, this change means that a player would also have the option of spending a WTL to avoid the Disadvantage result as well as the Ousted result.  After all, shouldn't the player have the option of loosing a WTL (or their Dependant!) instead of taking on the infection?  I think both are equally entertaining.</p>
<h4>Arm Up - Scaled down a tad.</h4>
<p>The Two Fisted characters should have been running out of WD much faster than they did.  Even with a couple lucky rolls in there.  Next playtest I'm going to alter the Arm Up chart from 4/8/12/20 to 3/6/9/15.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>finally...</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<h4>Fan o' McGuyver - No longer half on the WD.</h4>
<p>That's just a little rough IMO.  I'm going to make it so that a McGuyver character recives one level lower than everyone else on their Arm Up rolls.  So, effectively, an Arm Up chart for the McGuyver characters would look like 3/3/6/9 instead of 3/6/9/15.  We'll see how that works.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>That's five tweaks to the rules for the next playtest.  More than enough for fine-tuning time.  I'll expect to playtest through those next time.  I think the GM could use more GM cards, but maybe just fine tuning the usefullness of the cards themselves might be enough.  I've got an idea for how to make them more interesting as a whole.  But that'll take more work than the rest of those changes.</p>
<p>Whew.  Beddie-bye time.</p>
<p>Good game tonight guys.  I'm excited about where fine-tuning might bring this thing.</p>
