Now, certainly, you can get all fancy with that, and that's great, but put that aside for a moment.  <br/><br/>Regardless of claims to how story-like an RPG is or is not, there's significant satisfaction in seeing the old shark-fin of action, climax, denoument do it's thing - rise, peak, and fall.  And I've seen that happen plenty of times in games.<br/><br/>The part of that equation I have the most trouble reliably obtaining is satisfying peaks; points where the play has clearly hit the climactic moment for one or more characters, or for the "background" thing that they're all throwing down in addition to their personal stuff.<br/><br/>I have a few very sketchy thoughts, but nothing I can really articulate or use reliably.  So, I'll ask...<br/><br/>...How do <i>you </i>do it?  Anything you can articulate?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72204/#Comment_72204" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T14:25:03+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  2:25PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen several games do this.<br/><br/>MLWM has the point where one of the minions is locked into battle with the master.  That is the tipping point for the final battle and set of scenes which lead to the epilogue or game ending.<br/><br/>Contenders also does this (and borrowed from the above) by triggering endgame when a boxer reached a rep of 10.  This triggers a final scene for each boxer and then a final set of bouts which are everyone's last chance to make Hope rise above Pain.<br/><br/>My humble Game Chef entry The Dream Merchants semi-successfully steals from *both* of these games by triggering an endgame when one character reaches the end of the star chart on any axis.  Then there's a final set of scenes before the Epilogue Chart is consulted to see how the endings play out.<br/><br/>And how can I forget The Mountain Witch??  When I read that the GM holds off the end of Act I and Act II until the proper time and saw the rules work at the table, I was amazed.  It was *real* pacing and felt like a movie because of it.  Both of TMW games I was a part of were *very* dramatic and it certainly wasn't due to any brilliance by me as a player or GM.  It was designed that way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72205/#Comment_72205" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T14:25:23+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  2:25PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you mean as a writer?

Basically, the characters feel confident that (a) they know what needs to be done and (b) they have the power (mechanical backing) to do it.<br/><br/>In <em>Sons of Liberty,</em> the Primary Objective is one of the first things created each session (before PCs, even), and the players explicitly choose when to play the final level to fulfill the primary objective (after playing levels where the Patriots have whittled down the Tory pool of Tyranny).  There is a very palpable "oh, now it's <em>on</em>" vibe to the decision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
