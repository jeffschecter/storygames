I will attempt to remedy this.<br/><br/><b>FULL DISCLOSURE: EMPIRE OF DUST</b><br/>Empire of Dust is a role-playing/tactical-skirmish-game hybrid, created by myself and miss Amy Garcia.  <br/><br/><b>Presentation</b><br/>EoD is an old-school boxed set including a heavily illustrated, 222-page rulebook, 108 full-color, die-cut counters, and a glossy b&amp;w poster map.<br/><br/><b>Setting</b><br/>The game is set on the planet Osaris, a Dune/Dark Sun-esque desert planet. Players take on the role of a character from one of three main factions:<br/>-  The Xadian Alliance:  Fighting to restore their monarchy, which was deposed by a rampaging alien entity known as "Thron."<br/>-  The Legion of Thron:  Traitors who have betrayed their human brethren in order to aid Thron in his war of conquest.<br/>-  The Free Tribes of Osaris: A coalition of tribal Bruta, Osaris' native species, who are waging a war to reclaim their tribal homelands from the humans.<br/><br/>In terms of genre, I would consider EoD to be "soft" (space-opera-style) sci-fi, mixed with fantasy elements (magic and the supernatural).  For those of you who know video games, the overall aesthetic is something like Final Fantasy meets Gears of War.<br/><br/><b>System</b><br/>EoD is the second KNRPG title (the first being The Bizenghast Adventure Game) to use our <i>Epiphany Engine</i> game system.  Epiphany Engine is in the same family as games like Burning Wheel, Fate, and Savage Worlds . . . that is, it takes "traditional" rpg elements (attributes, skills, gear, etc . . .) and twists them in various interesting, "new school" ways to achieve a unique result.  Features include:<br/>-  Dynamic Character Advancement:  When your roll matches your stat, the stat goes up by one.  In other words, your character improves organically based on his/her actions in the game.<br/>-  Banter: A mechanic the gives tactical rewards for combat dialog.<br/>-  Character Death is a Choice: When your character is taken out, you choose either to "recover" (and gain a permanent injury) or "give up the ghost" (die).<br/>-  Unique Traits:  Traits are flavorful little rules exceptions (like feats in D&amp;D or stunts in SotC).  <i>Unique traits</i> are traits that only one character can have that tie the character into the setting in interesting ways (like a streamlined version of Lore Sheets in Weapons of the Gods).<br/><br/>The iteration of Epiphany Engine used in Empire of Dust is a very robust version that focuses on combat, chases, travel, persuasion, and conquest.  The game is also very focused on <i>setting simulation</i>.  It uses a heavily integrated "random encounter" system (which is more like a random situation/content generator) to simulate a living world that the PCs can interact with in very tangible ways.  We've tried to make the table-top equivalent of various "open-world" video games (GTA, Morrowind, etc . . .)  It's not really a "story game," the focus is less on creating a narrative and more on turning your characters loose in a fun, simulated environment.  All of this means that it is very easy to play/run without prep.  It's also very fun to GM in the same way that old-school Traveller is fun (you get to come up with clever justifications for a lot of random content).<br/><br/><b>Availability</b><br/>Though we officially released the game at Gen Con, it's not currently available anywhere else.  It will be available on IPR in the very near future.  The price is $40.<br/><br/>Hopefully that should give you a basic idea, though I'd be happy to answer any more questions that you might have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus" title="Ignotus"><img alt="Ignotus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus">Ignotus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164112/#Comment_164112" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T11:43:55+00:00" title="August 21, 2008 11:43AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ask and ye shall receive. <br/>\n<br/>\nI picked up Empire of Dust at Gencon and played it with my brother last night, a solo game (the game is best suited for four to six players, but it says one is ok).  My brother isn't big into RPGs, but he enjoys them every once in a while.  We were initially just going to mess around with character creation, but he liked his so much that he wanted to play immediately.  When I was explaining the game, the thing that really caught his imagination were the unique traits - traits that only one character can have, many of which give you a powerful and established role in the setting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJosh picked the Free Tribes faction, native aliens fighting to regain control of their ancestral lands.  He also took the unique trait "Chosen One," which made him prophecied to unite the fragmented tribes and defeat the humans.  So, Josh made Spotted Cloud, last survivor of a murdered tribe, and I built Still Water, the chieftain of the tribe that had taken him in.  The Tribal Chief trait gave Still Waters a retinue of five Bruta warriors, which I figured would help compensate for the fact that we had only two PCs .  Making characters in EoD is a blast.  The game instructs you to make a character that would be an awesome '80s action figure, and it's good advice.  The traits are both flavorful and mechanically interesting, and because you only get 3 of them to start off with (and don't get more for quite some time), I didn't feel the paralysis of choice I often do when plotting out the feat progression for a new PC in D&amp;D 3.5.  Each character then gets 3 pieces of equipment, which again presents some interesting choices.  And with that, the mechanical part of character generation is done, although there are tables to randomly generate your family and birthplace and connection to other party members.  Although there's a nice sheet in the back summarizing all the weapons, however, there is nothing like that for the traits - a big oversight, which led to lots of unnecessary page-flipping.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside, the counters included with the book are really, really cool.  They look stylish and iconic, and in general represent everything one might encounter in a battle (the only things that I could see that they don't do are support battles with more than two sides, or display characters that have been gored - the step beyond injured).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the adventure, I rolled on the convenient table of Free Tribes scenarios.  Spotted Cloud would be holding a tribal summit, at which he would attempt to convince several suspicious Bruta clans to accept him as the prophesied Chosen One.  Spotted Cloud and his retinue travelled to an ancient temple complex, cleansed it of insectoid Krythids, and readied it for the summit.  The battle went fairly smoothly, and the power of basic NPCs was demonstrated - nearly all of the Krythids were killed by Still Waters' retinue (who have stats as good as a starting character).  At the summit, we broke out the persuasion mechanics, which involve making skill checks to change the attitude of one's opponents, hopefully moving them towards friendly.  Deliberations were fairly successful, as Spotted Cloud invoked the prophecies and showed the other chiefs ancient murals he discovered in burial mounds beneath the temple (including an empty tomb marked for the Chosen One).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe final conflict of the session occurred when Spotted Cloud decided to prove his claim against the pretender, Hollow Cloud, a treacherous survivor of the massacre that destroyed Spotted Cloud's tribe.  With extreme prejudice.  Guardian spirits were summoned, giant phallic swords were swung, and the two sides were pretty evenly matched.  The big problem was SC and HC dueling in the center.  SC was using a war blade and had received the Warrior's Blessing from Still Waters.  That meant that when Hollow Cloud hit, Spotted Cloud got to make 3 successive rolls to negate the hit - parry, fate and killsave.  Hollow Cloud, on the other hand, wore heavy armor that negated much of the power of Spotted Cloud's attacks.  And so they whaled on each other for something like ten minutes in real time, each unable to ding the other, even with judicious use of medals.  Eventually, out of frustration we cut out the rest of the troops and just had the two roll against each other.  Spotted Cloud's sword finally struck home, and because of his traits he instantly eviscerated his rival, tossing him into the empty tomb.  At the end of the session, we rolled to see what occurred during the adventure.  A Bruta conquest!  Josh and I decided that the brutal tribes of the Western Reclamation Zone had conquered a powerful outpost of the human Legion, growing stronger and making Spotted Cloud's quest to bring the WRZ tribes under his banner that much more complicated.<br/>\n<br/>\nJosh was having a lot of fun up until the final combat, in which he became incredibly frustrated with the high whiff factor.  This may be a corner case - only two PCs, a small battlefield, all close combat and heavy armor, but it went poorly enough to significantly dampen Josh's enthusiasm for the game.  Empire of Dust has a number of awesome features.  It has a great ability to get players to buy in tightly to its setting and create fun characters; the scenario tables, random encounters, time lapse effects, settlement/ruin generators and mostly-comprehensive list of pre-built npcs make running the game easy and intuitive.  Our problem was that EoD leans pretty heavily on its combat system, and I'm not positive that the combat can support the weight.  As a disclaimer, I've only read the book once, and there was a lot of flipping pages and looking things up as we played.  If I've missed some rule(s) that would have made things go more smoothly, I apologize and would be glad for a correction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164115/#Comment_164115" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T11:51:17+00:00" title="August 21, 2008 11:51AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sam, thanks for the very cool rundown on the game.

It doesn't sound like you did anything <i>wrong</i> rules-wise, but tactically it might have been a good idea for Hollow Cloud to target Spotted Cloud's warblade with his attacks (rather than the character himself) to get rid of that pesky parry or for Spotted Cloud to target Hollow Cloud's armor (check the Weapons and Equipment heading on page 113).<br/><br/>Thanks again for posting!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164148/#Comment_164148" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T12:44:15+00:00" title="August 21, 2008 12:44PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's funny you mention not feeling paralyzed by the trait choices.

I just finished reading the book and had trouble understanding just when would be a good time to do a time-lapse roll (aside from when the PCs do something with time-lapse duration).  I was a little concerned that there wouldn't be any time-lapse rolls if the players just go from scene to scene without doing anything of long duration.

There's nothing wrong with the GM calling for time lapses when it makes sense (even though it's not really written into the game).  That said, in playtests we had a pretty decent amount of time lapse with just the normal triggers (PCs training, being defeated/imprisoned, etc . . .) It's particularly cool when the PCs make the conscious choice to do something that triggers a lapse (as they feel more responsible for the result).<br/><br/>Edit:  The example on page 162 is a really good demonstration of what I'm talking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lexifab" title="lexifab"><img alt="lexifab" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lexifab">lexifab</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164312/#Comment_164312" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-21T22:41:21+00:00" title="August 21, 2008 10:41PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob: Oops, my mistake.

I apologize for basically falling off the Earth post Gen Con.  The release of EoD has suffered from a variety of crises (both business and personal).  Things are leveling out . . . but still the best I can say is that we'll have EoD to IPR "soon."  I have a bunch of sets in my son's closet just waiting to be shipped out as soon as we get our box manufacturing situation figured out.<br/><br/>I'll probably post here and at our KNRPG blog once everything is worked out.  In the mean time, I'd be happy to field any questions that you may have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181017/#Comment_181017" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-01T10:57:20+00:00" title="December  1, 2008 10:57AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glad to hear that things are on track for the game, it is one of the few games I an really interested in getting besides Mouse Guard. <br/><br/>If there was some sort of pre-order with PDF deal I would be on that like gangbusters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181033/#Comment_181033" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-01T11:28:34+00:00" title="December  1, 2008 11:28AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe try alternatives to the box?
