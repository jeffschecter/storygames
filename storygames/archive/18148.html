I want some compromised successes and hard bargains!</blockquote>\nI think that it could be perceived as unfair if you converted a full success into a partial so zircher's suggestion above is really good. I'd be tempted to expand the +2 to +5, after all that is still just a 25% chance of complications ie the interesting stuff!<br/>IMO a bigger, related problem under D20 etc is when failure = "nothing happens".<br/><br/>Interestingly all of this is baked into the d20 roll by Matt Finch in his quick primer for OSR gaming where he suggests that the DM add in complications/consequences for high/low rolls in combat to keep things interesting. Look what he says:\n<blockquote>It\u2019s also your job to inject events from outside the rules during combat. \u201cYou rolled a 1.<br/>Your sword goes flying.\u201d \u201cYou rolled a 1. You trip and fall.\u201d \u201cYou rolled a 1. Your<br/>sword sticks into a crack in the floor.\u201d \u201cHey, you rolled a 20. You spin around and gain<br/>an extra attack.\u201d Hey, you rolled a 20. You slay the orc, kick his body off your sword,<br/>and blood spatters into the eyes of one of the orcs behind him. He\u2019s not getting an attack<br/>this round.\u201d \u201cHey, you rolled a 20. You knock his sword out of his hand even though<br/>you didn\u2019t do enough damage to kill him.\u201d That\u2019s just a set of examples for the various<br/>ways you could handle natural rolls of 1 or 20. Each result is different, and none of them<br/>were official \u2013 you just made them up out of nowhere. You\u2019re being consistent \u2013 the<br/>high and low rolls always generate a good or bad result \u2013 but exactly what happens is<br/>pretty much a matter of you deciding what seems realistic, or really fun.<br/><br/>Also, flavorful combat isn\u2019t just in the naturally high and low rolls. A character leaps<br/>onto a table, but the table breaks. Swinging into combat on a rope succeeds \u2013 but the<br/>rope breaks and the character ends up swinging into the wrong group of monsters. A hit<br/>by a monster causes one of the characters to drop a torch. The feathered plume on<br/>someone\u2019s helmet is chopped off by a missed stroke. All these little details add to the<br/>quality of old-style combat, and change it dramatically from a sequence of d20 rolls into<br/>something far more alive and exciting. This doesn\u2019t mean, of course, that every swing of<br/>a sword blade and every step into combat must generate lavish descriptions and details<br/>from you. It\u2019s a matter of pacing, and frankly I can\u2019t explain how to do it well other than<br/>to say you\u2019ll get the hang of it.</blockquote>\nSo, this is kinda what AW etc are doing, in a more explicit way.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_409865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409865/#Comment_409865" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T04:19:34+00:00" title="March 21, 2013  4:19AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was a thing kind of like this that went with E6.

If the roll is five or below the difficulty level, it's a bad failure. If it's five above, it's a good success.<br/><br/>3. Roll an extra d20. If both dice are below the difficulty level, bad failure. If both dice are successful, good success.<br/><br/>Everything else in all three suggestions above are partial failure (No, but) and partial success (Yes, but). Bad failure and good success are "No, and" and "Yes, and".<br/><br/>4. All failed rolls creates a new obstacle instead. Examples: you have lock picked the door, but there's a guard behind the door.

My system is simple: every five points over the target number is an extra degree of success, every five points under the target number is an extra degree of failure. A natural '1' is an extra degree of failure regardless of the result (so you could still succeed if your bonuses are high enough and the task easy, but you also get a single degree of failure - sort of a mixed success outcome), a natural '20' explodes (usually providing you a relatively large degree of success).<br/><br/>(The obvious variant is that if you don't like wildly swinging degrees of success, then make a '20' just give an extra degree of success in addition to the calculated outcome - the opposite of a natural '1'. It's still a lot of success, unless you were making a desperation play of some sort.)<br/><br/>As for what the degrees of failure and success do, they work as a currency, sort of like in The Mountain Witch - you can buy all sorts of things with them. The first success or failure always goes for establishing the task result that was under consideration, but either the GM or the player can allocate the rest. For example, in combat this principle turns into "stunting", where a player declares additional facts of positioning or status attacks (disarming, tripping, pushing opponents) on the strength of their "extra" success. In information gathering the GM might declare that OK, you get one question per degree of success, choose them well.<br/><br/>My house rules also organically develop special package deals. For example, a fourth-degree success in combat is usually a "critical hit" that fells ordinary foes in one blow regardless of hitpoints. The player could also request to split that into four lesser effects, which is sometimes important tactically, if they need to e.g. defeat the foe and do something else as well at the same time.<br/><br/>When there are both success and failure involved (due to rolling a fumble, or for some more exotic reason), the currency is not neutralized if at all possible, but rather the success will be mixed with lateral failure modes. You get what you wanted, but you also get an extra complication you have to deal with now, or whatever. Resisted checks of various sorts might be resolved in this manner: give both sides as much success as their degree of success indicates, and once they've gained all the success they can lateral of each other (that is, forms of success that are not also failures of the opponent), then deduct the rest of the success from each other and award the remainder to the winner (the one with the more degrees of success) as a victory, and the opponent as a defeat.<br/><br/>What makes this a "partial success system" is the task-resolution logic: because an individual conflict can be resolved by one or more tasks, but it usually does require more than just the simple completion of a single task, the issue is often not whether you succeed in some task, but rather whether you succeed well enough to achieve conflict victory out of it. For example, if the conflict can be resolved by climbing over the wall and escaping into a crowd, then a "partial success" might be one where you "only" got a first degree of success in your climbing check; you'd have needed to get that +5 points to achieve second degree, in which case we could have established that you managed to disappear into the crowd. As it is, that partial success only buys you a venue change and perhaps a superior position from where to continue resolving the situation.<br/><br/>If nobody has a subgame in mind when a task is rolled for, the degrees do nothing - the binary success model is the fall-back. However, if somebody rolls really well or badly even in a minor task, there is a vested interest for either the player or the GM in at least quickly thinking through the situation in case some natural follow-up occurs. So basically, if you fuck up a roll spectacularly, that'll only have consequences if the GM can invent something on the spot. If not, then apparently it wasn't a very interesting topic to begin with. Sometimes the consequences of extra success or failure are much more important than other times: if the situation is complex and there are lots of interesting moving parts, it's much more important to fail or succeed big than when the stakes are small and the situation straightforward.<br/><br/>I don't know off-hand whether my system would do that well in d20. It's a pretty complete system in what it does, so I'm sure that something of this sort would fuck it up one way or another. But on the other hand, you could do interesting things with the currency. For example, my D&amp;D doesn't use skills, but if it did, like d20 does, then support skills wouldn't just give you flat bonuses; you'd instead get bonus dice equal to your degree of success, like TSoY does.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amp108" title="amp108"><img alt="amp108" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amp108">amp108</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409995/#Comment_409995" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T17:34:31+00:00" title="March 21, 2013  5:34PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a house rule, I like the idea of having a second die roll as espoused by Felan and others.<br/><br/>As a philosophical/design question, the linearity of a single-die roll is always going to model binary success-or-failure better than it does partial results, simply because any successful roll is as likely as any other successful roll, and ditto for failures. Some people like to phrase this as "with a d20, a 20 is just as likely as a 1", but what they really mean is "with a d20, a 20 is just as likely as a 19."<br/><br/>In D&amp;D, Complex skill rolls in 3.x and Skill Challenges in 4e attempt to add more options to the inherent binariness of the roll, by requiring multiple rolls and having each one turn into a partial success or failure. Skill challenges still typically rely on the result of the last roll, though. You could easily modify them so that, in addition to the final yes-or-no success roll, small penalties are incurred along the way; what those penalties are would depend on the situation.<br/><br/>Alternately, you could say that unsuccessful die rolls succeed at the task, but with some kind of consequence or penalty. So the rogue unlocks the padlock, but just as he does, some bugbear guards round the corner; or a player's reflexes really do save him from a trap, but he slips and drops a potion container. This is the basic indie-game "yes, but..." pattern as applied to saves. The best way to handle this as a GM is to negotiate for the penalty before rolling, so players know the stakes they're up against.<br/><br/>I go that way myself, but I also try to find options for the players where they have clear, unopposed actions which may themselves be successful or not. What I mean by this is, in addition to simply rolling to Detect Traps, I would allow them the option of, say, rolling a barrel down a corridor and setting off the poison darts or whatnot without being in the line of fire. That would always succeed, although deliberately springing the trap may have unintended consequences as well. But it wouldn't rely on a die roll at all: the roll is only there as a back-up.<br/><br/>Finally, consider this: basic, simple combat is a d20 system that has partial success built into it: you hit, but only do 2 damage. The orc hits and does 3 back. After 3 turns, you've succeeded at killing or driving it off, but you've taken damage yourself. The basic pattern here is success plus a point tracking system, and a chance to lose something. I don't know how to apply this to other rolls, but it's useful to think of it in this light to see that the d20 isn't <i>always</i> straight success or failure.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410027/#Comment_410027" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-21T21:39:58+00:00" title="March 21, 2013  9:39PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2013 9:41PM by Felan.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There must be some times when you don't have a good twist, right?

My earlier posts might be too broad - I definitely narrate different kinds of outcomes for different rolls. But I think the "yes, but" success with a cost or compromise is a very specific kind of outcome that isn't really accounted for with d20 vs target number, even if the GM is interpreting the results relatively. It covers "yes, and" and "no, and" just fine - but not "yes, but."<br/><br/>I would prefer to have a specific "trigger" for the "yes, but" GM action. I'm also uncertain how allowing d20 failures (ie: below the target number) be occasionally treated as compromised success in the fiction might mess with the math of the game - I feel like, according to the logic of the system, not meeting the target number should never result in a success. Likewise, I don't feel comfortable treating a roll that beats the target number as a compromised success, which just doesn't seem fair - if you beat the number, it's gotta be a full success, you've earned it.<br/><br/>Hence why I think a player-bid method of some kind works well - the player knows in advance that only a compromised success is possible, and accepts the risk. What I like about the +2/+5 player-bid method described above is that it's a clearly-defined, fairly narrow threshold that both players and GM understand and are aware of, just as clearly as &gt;DC = success. In case it's gotten lost in the shuffle, this is what I'm planning on trying:\n<blockquote>After a failed roll, the player can choose to add +2 or +5 to the total. If the new total bumps the roll over the target number, it is treated as a partial success - the degree of cost or compromise is determined by the how much the player "bids" - +2 is minor risk, +5 is a major risk.<br/><br/>In a combat situation, a minor risk might simply result in an attack of opportunity; a major risk could be a disarm, or a bull rush off a platform. Out of combat, say lockpicking, a minor risk could result in broken tools; a major risk could result in a trap being triggered.</blockquote>\n<br/>Thanks for the run-down, <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> - a much more elaborate hack than I'd be willing to experiment with (I'm trying to leave the game as unaltered as possible), but you point to some interesting techniques. <br/><br/>The various multi-dice methods suggested are cool, but for me personally, I'm trying to minimize the extra math. I feel like calculating modifiers on two dice for every roll would slow down the game too much.\n<blockquote>Finally, consider this: basic, simple combat is a d20 system that has partial success built into it: you hit, but only do 2 damage.</blockquote>\nThat's a really good point - in and of itself, that's a multi-dice approach to degrees of success and failure. It's strange to imagine what that would look like outside of combat - roll your lockpicking skill, beat the target number and succeed; then roll your lockpicking tools' "damage" rating to see exactly how successful you are.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410040/#Comment_410040" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T00:04:56+00:00" title="March 22, 2013 12:04AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a "solution" that <i>totally doesn't work</i>: if you hit your DC with <i>just</i> the die roll, you succeed.

All you need for non-binary results is a distribution of possible outcomes. Hence fail the roll, make the roll, make the roll by 5, etc is one way of specifying a distribution. Because the d20 is linear, changes to target number make linear changes to the probability of each outcome in the distribution. The nice thing about bell curves (such as the sum of two or more die rolls) is that you get non-linear adjustments to the probabilities for linear adjustments to the target numbers but this is not necessary for there to be a range of outcomes. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410048/#Comment_410048" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T02:13:19+00:00" title="March 22, 2013  2:13AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Here's a "solution" that <i>totally doesn't work</i>: if you hit your DC with <i>just</i> the die roll, you succeed.
