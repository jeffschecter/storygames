(or, occasionally, "Think of a slightly silly sounding item, name, then create an effect for it.").   <br/><br/>"Too powerful" is rarely a concern in DW, because all effects are filtered through the fiction.  Avoiding duplication of moves will require a little bit of knowledge of what the advanced moves for your characters are, but doesn't sound like an insurmountable obstacle.  A little bit of googling around seems to generate large numbers of interesting items for fairly little effort, but again, I'd suggest going from Idea to Item, rather than picking out some items/effects and then trying to insert them into your game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trollkin" title="Trollkin"><img alt="Trollkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/416/nMMC7YR4RA7NU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trollkin">Trollkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440062/#Comment_440062" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-10T19:04:25+00:00" title="November 10, 2014  7:04PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks airk <br/><br/>I feel kind of silly now I was creating my items backwards by taking an item then adding fiction to it, I guess it's an old habit from D&amp;D that I'm going to have to break if I want to create great magical items for Dw.<br/><br/>I've even started working on flow charts to help me make items through questions that I can simple go through to create new item so I can add the fiction to each item as I create it.

I reckon it's hard to stay away from the D&amp;D tradition (+1 to attacks, fire damage, +1 to CA, etc.); players tend to expect to receive magical objects at a rate similar to D&amp;D, and sometimes are not very interested in the stuff I give them, they want things that make them mechanically better.<br/><br/>The things that yielded most enthusiasm from players were "overpowered" magic items, because they instantly became a resource to be considered when facing an obstacle: a spell scroll that lets you instantly kill in flames someone anywhere in the world (only once), a ring that lets you slip into the ghost world for free, a set of two rings that can be used to divide damaged as desired between both bearers, a bracelet that, when worn, makes you immune to surprise and treachery, but also uncapable of it. That sort of stuff.<br/><br/>When in doubt, I make the item consumable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Akchizar" title="Akchizar"><img alt="Akchizar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/407/nK0KWE2DNMA2X.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Akchizar">Akchizar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440084/#Comment_440084" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-11T22:00:39+00:00" title="November 11, 2014 10:00PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think previous posters have covered DW magic item creation pretty well - here are a couple of specific techniques I've used to create "stock" magical items, and/or mirror traditional D&amp;D loot:<br/><br/><b>Charges:</b> Wands come with <i>x</i>-charge (<i>x</i>=5, 10, whatever you wish). Each wand comes with a move that starts: "When you <b>say the wand's activation phrase</b>, spend charge and roll +charge spent..."<br/><br/>(Do they know the activation phrase? No? Time to go on an adventure to find someone who does!)<br/><br/><b>Cursed items:</b> may or may not have other bonuses, but generally have a conditional XP-gain mechanic attached. For instance: "Whenever you goad someone into a fight, mark XP"; "Whenever you betray a friend, mark XP"; "Whenever you run or hide rather than fight, mark XP". This lets the player retain agency, but still encourages them to give into the curse.<br/><br/><b>Private moves:</b> I haven't done this yet, but I can imagine handing one player an index card with the move of their new magic item written on it. Now they know what it does, but the rest of the party is still amazed when they use it to summon beasts from the nether realms...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440092/#Comment_440092" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-12T03:33:15+00:00" title="November 12, 2014  3:33AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I ran "Keep on the Borderlands" in DW, one of the players rescued a hostage and got a magic dagger.
