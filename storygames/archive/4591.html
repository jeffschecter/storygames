(Since the work is the sum of its parts, actually you are destroying the whole thing, but we're just talking about parts for now.)<br/>4 - If you destroy something bad, that improves its quality.<br/><br/>Thus, bad source material leads to good gaming because you aren't losing anything when you (as you inevitably must) get rid of something the creator made.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104034/#Comment_104034" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-21T11:38:16+00:00" title="October 21, 2007 11:38AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Not a problem.</blockquote>\nThanks!

However, I would add that there is often another reason why good fiction makes for bad gaming--and that reason is efficient use of its material. <br/><br/>All the "good stuff" in a great story exists to serve a purpose in <i>that story</i>. If we try to use that as material for our new story, it probably won't work so well. Those ingredients were specially chosen to make a ratatouille--they won't make a good soup. It's hard to tell a good story about Darth Vader that doesn't have to do with his fall and redepmtion.<br/><br/>But taking the material that's kind of messed up and pointless, we can add the missing ingredient that ties into a cool Situation and have fun.<br/><br/>But... back to the topic of this thread:<br/><br/>I'll clarify why I posted this quote. It seems to me that G.K. Chesterton is saying that a bad author is one who fails to tell us something about the hero, thereby revealing his or her own lack of talent.

Surely, in all seriousness, we do learn something important about an author when we read a great work of theirs. Don't we?<br/><br/>But does reading a good novel tell us something about ourselves, the reader? Many people have been talking about how a good story game can do that.

I think G.K. was saying that a good author can make any scene in his or her book come to life, not just the ones he or she agrees with. Everyone, even the obvious villain, has something that the reader can relate to. The writer is good because even when he or she is saying something, there are still characters and events on the wrong side of the author's debate that still evoke understanding, sympathy, or at least interest from the reader.<br/><br/>The bad writer makes his thematic debate obvious, and lets you know plainly which characters are the Good Guys and which events are the Good Things, and vice versa. There is unintended caricature, which puts the reader at a remove from the story, because the people and events aren't quite as nuanced as in real life. Think Dean Koontz's later work, or Ayn Rand, or a lot of fantasy fiction. Thus the author is telling you about his personal beliefs and agendas, not about the story or what the characters believe. <br/><br/>As far as RPGs go: On the one hand we like nuanced characters, particularly NPCs, and most of us like PCs who come across as a full-fledged person. OTOH, because we like to tell ripping good stories, we instead stick to Stock Characters, and hopefully in story-games give pivotal events in the character's life that allow for growth and ambiguity and struggle to emerge naturally. I believe we start with hackneyed, clich\xc3\xa9d characters, but end up with (we hope) something more during the game session. Most stories try to make their characters nuanced from the get-go, which they can do because their character's backstory is an essential part of the story, whereas it's more-or-less a fluffy starting point in most RPGs. Hero quest helps by making the backstory pivotal in character creation, but really, until the character begins to grow during play, it can only do so much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner" title="Chris Gardiner"><img alt="Chris Gardiner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris%20Gardiner">Chris Gardiner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104051/#Comment_104051" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-21T14:42:26+00:00" title="October 21, 2007  2:42PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah - I always read that passage the same way Carl did.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have nothing more to add, save for my usual squeals of delight whenever anything Chesterton-related happens in my vicinity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104160/#Comment_104160" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T10:12:51+00:00" title="October 22, 2007 10:12AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 22, 2007 10:13AM by Max Higley.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Peter Aronson</cite><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Not a problem.</blockquote>\nThanks!

I think it makes an excellent roleplaying game for the reasons I outlined above: the characters are broadly written, and only over time do we see anything resembling nuance, growth, or development occur. (In this case, screen-time=game-time.) Yeah, the plots seemed to both veer randomly and be able to be seen coming from a mile away, which is exactly how an average RPG campaign works. This is due to odd randomizers and stock expectations of the genre involved. <br/><br/>It would be hard to do the nuance of "On the Road" with an RPG, or the writings of James Joyce, etc. because novelists control everything in the novel, revealing what they need to reveal, hiding what they need to hide, and if it's well-done, it'll come off both refreshing and comfortably expected. Neither GMs nor players usually have that much input, due to randomizers and because most people don't want that much character exploration in their games, or don't know how to pull that off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave" title="Sean Musgrave"><img alt="Sean Musgrave" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Musgrave">Sean Musgrave</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104362/#Comment_104362" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T12:20:32+00:00" title="October 23, 2007 12:20PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really see why people see the quote as a condemnation of narrativism.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fundamental principle of narrativism is "Address a broad human issue.".

If instead I "merely" end up revealing something about myself in trying to portray the character, I consider the exercise a failure, of sorts. I'd even go far as to say that I'd rather have nothing about myself revealed in the character I portray. It's all "the character," none of it me. (naturally, I usually fall short of this Platonic ideal.)<br/><br/>This is of course just one particular aesthetic ideal. Not something I think all-right-thinking people should aim for. Just something I sometimes go for, and if I understand the quote correctly, something G. K. Chesterton is also interested in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
