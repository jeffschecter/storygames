Throughout the show, Masters has refused to lie and cheat.  <br/><br/>*****SPOILER!!!*****<br/><br/>There's a scene where Masters tries to talk sense into the patient and it doesn't work.  In the next scene, she decides to cheat and rig some symptoms.<br/><br/>It was very dramatic.  She did it!  She crossed the line!  How's that gonna work out for her?  Ah, it seems that she doesn't want to be put in situations like this anymore... so she's quitting!  Nice.  My girlfriend called it: "She <i>wants</i> to be an exceptional doctor, but she <i>needs</i> her principles."<br/><br/>It was also very plausible, in the context of the show, where doctors never get sued for rigging symptoms, faking tests, etc.<br/><br/>My girlfriend and I agreed: plausible, dramatic, good episode.<br/><br/>Here's where we diverged:<br/><br/><b>Me:</b> Why wasn't Masters more resourceful in convincing the patient?  Dredge up similar cases, show the risk of death.  Explain the speed of the tumor growth, give numbers and probabilities.  Make the risk concrete, make it real, drive it home.  That's what I'd do...<br/><br/><b>Her:</b> What?  Oh.  Yeah, that makes sense.  It didn't jump out at me.  I'm not sure that I care.  Seeing what she chose and how it turned out is the important thing.<br/><br/>My attitude fits well in a Right to Dream game.  Hers fits well in Story Now.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322898/#Comment_322898" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T14:36:33+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  2:36PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2011 2:37PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I bring this up partly in response to the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14143&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">thread</a> on immersion and Story Now, specifically Chris K. and Bill W.'s comments about distance.<br/><br/>There's a reason why Ron Edwards' essays included the phrase "internal cause is king" for Right to Dream but not for Story Now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322921/#Comment_322921" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T15:37:43+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  3:37PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite><b>Me:</b> Why wasn't Masters more resourceful in convincing the patient?

Getting her to the point where she could push past her dogmatic idealism and break the rules to save a patient took a long time and a lot of effort; to get over her social ineptitude at the same time would have seemed like a bridge too far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_322935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322935/#Comment_322935" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T16:45:49+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  4:45PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For some reason I cannot think of this in GNS terms at all. I think I know why, but I'm not certain. <br/><br/>There's this distinction between how agenda has been talked about in the scope of the Big Model and how it was initially defined in the essays which I think are still much closer to rgfa GDS than how I personally understand CA. I don't really put any value in Ron's original essays.<br/><br/>"Internal cause" belongs (imo) to GDS' Simulationism, which isn't directly related to Right to Dream anymore. It's a different thing entirely. I think this is something Vincent has been trying to get across in both AW and Storming where he pairs Simulationism with both Story Now and Step on Up, respectfully.<br/><br/>And then there's this thing about how immersion in Forge theory isn't this one specific thing but merely the achievement of "flow" when the elements click together, the CA arrow isn't obstructed and the game pulls you in.<br/><br/>Character immersion, or Deep In-Character play is not necessarily related to any of those imo. It's not Sim and it's not Right to Dream. It's just one of the possible "techiques" if I may use that term. I also see the notion of "full character immersion" as being antithetical to "story" as at least a bit silly. I'll bet you that even the most hardcore roleplayers in this sense don't act out their characters taking a dump in detail: they/we editorialize, because this is a fictional reality, and we use the fictional reality <i>for</i> something, not to merely replicate reality 1:1, at which point it stops being a game. I just don't see it working practically at all in any way and I don't think how anyone who has ever sat down (or stood up) to play a game could advocate for it in a functional social setting. <br/><br/>I think character immersion gets lumped together with Sim, because well, in-world reasons for things happening go much better with it than gamey reasons for things happening or authorial reasons for things happening. That doesn't mean they're the same imo.<br/><br/>I think it gets lumped together with Right to Dream, because both Step on Up and Story Now require <b>conflict</b> and conflict must be resolved in some meta-fictional way, with some system or mechanic or agreement, which breaks immersion. Right to Dream on the other hand is "safe" in the sense that our dreams and fantasies are not contradicted, which means that we never have a conflict (or shouldn't, ideally), but we still have to editorialize, flag, communicate etc. because <i>there are other people at the table</i> so perfect in-character play is impossible even in RtD. RtD with full character immersion is impossible to achieve in a social situation, which is why I don't find it strange that Forge theory doesn't recognise it, because Forge theory is, from the start, the theory of the social dynamics in RPG play. From practice I would say it ends when one of the players leaves in tears.<br/><br/>I think what Bill is talking about in that thread is just the old Actor/Director/Pawn stance or whatever distinction, just in different terms.<br/><br/>But you know, this is all just me fitting the pieces together in a way that matters to me. As I already said, I don't really care about Ron's essays, so if we're talking about them specifically, ok, then I really don't have anything to say.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_322937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/322937/#Comment_322937" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-03T16:59:53+00:00" title="May  3, 2011  4:59PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And because I totally ignored that part...<br/><br/>If I apply my reading I'd say your approach is actually RGFA Sim (in-world resources and leverage, reasons and causes) with Forge Step on Up ("I could do it better.") and your girlfriend is Forge Story Now (see what happens, moral choices) with RGFA Drama (the in-world reasons aren't of prime importance as long as it's dramatic), if anything. <br/><br/>Unless if you read Right to Dream as "Masters should have succeeded" and you were dissatisfied with the episode because it let you down, since it didn't fit your idea about the character (basically the GM screwed with your PC concept and crossed a line).

I personally find it's a useful analytical tool to apply after a game to figure out what went on (after all, CA is concerns periods of play, not moment-to-moment in play decisions). Did I find the game satisfying? Why, why not? Did everyone else? Why?<br/><br/>I think the most simple way to put it is that <i>CA is about whether we found an instance of play satisfying or not</i>.<br/><br/>As you play a game, things will happen and things will change (maybe now you've got some new notes on your character sheet, the characters are in a different situation, their environment has changed, you're rolling a bigger die for one of your skills). Were these changes, overall, over the course of this session, satisfying?<br/><br/>A metaphor for an unfulfilled agenda would be someone going to a hockey match only to find a figure skating competition going on. Things are still happening, things are changing, skaters are getting points, some people are enjoying it but you'll probably still walk out bored.<br/><br/>--<br/>As for clashes, I could cite some recent examples from my games but I don't know if that will be useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
