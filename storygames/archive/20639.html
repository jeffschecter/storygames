According to the person who mentioned it, however, it was an *actual game* at some point about ten years ago or so. In either case, here it is - because it's pretty thought-provoking:<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>A game is designed and sold, with a very unusual clause:<br/><br/><b><i>The players of this game will never fully know the rules of the game.</i></b><br/><br/>What you do is you buy a booklet which explains the basics of play, and then download a sort of program or app which can be installed on mobile devices (like smartphones*).<br/><br/>The visible rules of the game just tell you when to engage the real system, which is in the software.<br/><br/>For instance, you could have a rule which says, "When you attack someone, enter your character's weapon and target into the program and hit 'Calculate'."<br/><br/>The program then returns a result, perhaps something like: "You've hit the Orc, and wounded him heavily."<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The GM and players all use the program instead of dice - it calculates odds and stats and all that kind of stuff - but none of them, not even the GM, know what's happening behind the scenes, inside "the box". Perhaps your character writeup says that you're a "competent warrior", but you don't know what that really means. Perhaps your character details say you can use your psionic powers, and, to do so, specify if you're trying a) just a little, b) pretty hard, c) or really really pushing with everything you've got, and then enter your attempt into the program. <br/><br/>Finally, it tells you what the results are.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><br/><br/>*: At the time this game was published - if it is indeed real - there were no smartphones; the game was expected to run on PDAs, Palm Pilots, and/or laptops.<br/><br/>Note: Apparently, you *could* pay extra money to buy "developer" status and then you'd have access to the actual rules and the code for the software. But that's neither here nor there for our purposes, as it makes this a *less* interesting thought experiment, not *more* so.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452918/#Comment_452918" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T03:16:08+00:00" title="May  4, 2016  3:16AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What would playing this game be like?<br/><br/>Would you agree to play?<br/><br/>Would you agree to pay money for this game?<br/><br/>Would your friends believe you that you do not know the rules?<br/><br/>The idea of a GM and players exploring a fictional world without either side really knowing how things might turn out at any given moment, but learning it over time, is pretty fascinating.

I like PbtA games because they tend not to have that problem -- I can make my character how I like and be reasonably confident that they'll do what they should.<br/><br/>I guess this kind of a game would work if the fear and uncertainty was the whole point, like a game set in the Lovecraftian Dreamlands or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lacuna</span>, where I just don't know the mechanics and have to enjoy the helplessness. But that kind of enjoyment is not very immersive, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452925/#Comment_452925" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T05:20:33+00:00" title="May  4, 2016  5:20AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not only would this work for an enormous audience, fairly soon, it will.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452926/#Comment_452926" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T06:56:15+00:00" title="May  4, 2016  6:56AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like the basic idea is "fiction in, fiction out," which I totally love.

And enough people are serious about understanding the mechanisms underlying any game they play that it's unlikely that anyone who genuinely wants to know how things work will be unable to find out: within a month, whatever they're interested in will be on a wiki somewhere.<br/><br/>But not everyone is actually all that interested in understanding the mechanics of a game, and if the game itself isn't heavily tilted towards giving an advantage to players who understand the mechanics, then it's really a non-issue: if people who know the rules change their behavior, it's not going to put pressure on people who don't know the rules to change their behavior the same way. You might be happier knowing that you have made the best possible warrior within the system, but your friend can be just as happy playing their own character without the benefit of your painstaking research.<br/><br/>The problem comes when a game <i>does</i> give a significant advantage to system mastery, even if it's just in terms of avoiding dead-ends or "trap skills." If knowing the rules gives a recognizably better experience than not knowing them, even the people who don't care about the rules are at the very least going to start following the lead of the people who do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454065/#Comment_454065" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-22T17:56:23+00:00" title="June 22, 2016  5:56PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As we're discussing transparency of method as a tool for building trust at the gaming table, this thread seems quite relevant once more!<br/><br/>What would it take for you to jump into this kind of game and be ready to enjoy it?<br/><br/>I like the idea of the program allowing customized rules, as well. In other words, I could prepare a set of rules/settings and then upload them for my friend to use in his game. Meanwhile, he would do the same for me. Now we're both playing with a ruleset we're not familiar with. While very bizarre, there could be room for a whole other school of design thought to emerge from this kind of approach to game design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
