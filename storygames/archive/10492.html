Ralph asked me to break that down.  So it here goes, concrete examples and everything!<br/><br/>A group of Mouse Guard players get into a heated argument with the mayor of the town.  We go into an Argument Conflict (i.e. MG version of Dual of Wits).  We each say what we want.  The guard mice want the mayor to recognize their authority in the situation at hand.  The mayor wants to put the mice in their place since they technically have no jurisdiction inside of his town.  Great.<br/><br/>We execute the Conflict procedures.  We script things.  Each action we reveal what we\u2019re doing.  We roll dice.  We add or subtract disposition.  Helping dice are passed around.  Narration is limited to, \u201cOkay, this action I attack with my deceiver skill\u201d and \u201cYeah, I\u2019m helping with Politian-wise because I know how this stuff works!\u201d and so on.  In other words we have only the vaguest sense of what\u2019s happening moment to moment.<br/><br/>In the end, things resolve the mayor is either cowed or has asserted his dominance and which ever side lost adjust their next action accordingly and play proceeds.  This is IIEE w/o Teeth.  We jumped from \u201cthe Guard and Mayor are fighting over authority\u201d to \u201cthe Mayor is cowed and submits to the Guard\u201d with no real idea how that was accomplished.  *How* did the Guard mice cow the Mayor is completely lost except for some vague notions about \u201cthey argued.\u201d  In Mouse Guard maintaining those details requires the discipline Vincent talks about.<br/><br/>This, however, isn\u2019t Storyboarding because we\u2019re still in the realm of the characters want x and the force that opposes them wants y and here is which gets what and to what degree.  We\u2019re losing the details but narrative motion and creative input authority are maintained.  Storyboarding (as I mean it) requires one player reaching over and moving around bits that don\u2019t belong to him in order to establish a plot point of their personal preference.<br/><br/>Example: \u201cOkay, so Joe and I are finally in that dual we\u2019ve been threatening to have happen when Mary walks in the middle of it and I accidentally stab her!\u201d  What I\u2019ve done here is completely walked all over whatever Joe may have wanted out of having a duel with my character in the first place in favor of jumping to some other point of drama.  Not only have we lost the details of the duel, we\u2019ve lost the whole duel and any emotional content it may have had.  Joe is now put in the position of having to socially defend the creative validity of the duel as its own thing.<br/><br/>Where I\u2019ve seen this most often are players over stating the Agenda part of scene requesting in Primetime Adventures.  For example even this milder form, \u201cThe Agenda is Joe and I are having a duel when Mary walks in on us\u201d shifts focus away from the duel an on to Mary\u2019s discovery of the duel in progress again losing all the emotional content of the duel.<br/><br/>Does that make the distinction clear?<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233121/#Comment_233121" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T18:18:28+00:00" title="September 18, 2009  6:18PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2009 6:21PM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, it sounds like a distinction between players who are more "contained" by the perspective/dramatic concerns of their characters, and players who are not. <br/><br/>Am I with ya? If I am, then it sounds like you're describing an issue of Stance - Director vs. Author, perhaps. <br/><br/>Actually, beyond that, it sounds like you're also not a fan of players whose narrative decisions make what they want "spill over" onto other players' turf - <blockquote> <b>Jesse said:</b> What I\u2019ve done here is completely walked all over whatever Joe may have wanted out of having a duel with my character in the first place in favor of jumping to some other point of drama.</blockquote> comes to mind ^_^<br/><br/>I can't say I've actually seen this version of "story boarding" encouraged in any games, although admittedly I have a shallow knowledge of what's out there. Still, this seems like the kind of thing to be avoided, rather than something anyone's system would really discourage. <br/><br/>To quibble, I would define story-boarding more like the Mouse Guard example - the act of pulling away from the moment to moment concerns of the scene in favor of the overall "movements" of the scene - movements as in sections of a classical orchestral piece. I've experienced this definition of story-boarding while playing Spirit of the Century, although arguably that had more to do with circumstantial factors, like I mentioned when posting the experience to Story-Games.<br/><br/>OK, to be fair - what we're discussing here is kind of distinct from IIEE concerns; as I see it, IIEE refers to actions taken by the character, as opposed to meta-narrative actions taken by the player. In that case, SotC is off the hook for dodging proper IIEE, for now... ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233122/#Comment_233122" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T18:39:26+00:00" title="September 18, 2009  6:39PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zac,<br/><br/>What I'm describing is completely distinct from Stance as defined in the Big Model.

I'd be intrigued to consider a game that's sort of the inverse of Polaris, w.r.t. how characters are handled - instead of several full-on Protagonists running in tandem, maybe the players join up to form a sort of Directors' Guild, where they make a bevy of characters to use for different scenes and stuff?<br/>Would thinly-spread, or perhaps rotating, protagonization do anything to move away from a character-centric approach? Think about the show Grey's Anatomy - unlike Scrubs or House, it gives us a suite of characters who all have their own stuff going on. You could assign player responsibilities and powers such that everyone was a co-GM with everyone else, able to introduce characters from the Character Stable, pop in new conflicts, escalate existing ones, resolve ones that have plateau'd (sp?), etc.<br/><br/>Or does this still linger in what you feel is a character-focused mentality/language? Personally, I have a hard time seeing stories happen without characters. Does "spreading the wealth" of protagonism do anything about this, in your views?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233131/#Comment_233131" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T19:13:13+00:00" title="September 18, 2009  7:13PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have seen this at a distance once and up close once.<br/><br/>At a distance, a friend talked about a PTA game where the group brainstormed  storyboard-style their way through what should have been three seasons of PTA play and wondered why their session was flat.  It was because they needed to stop brainstorming/storyboarding and start-a-playing.<br/><br/>Up close was really interesting.  I wanted to show my dad the Dictionary of Mu, how it worked.  So, he made up a character, a real bastard too.  My dad's character was almost too evil to be a character.  The guy was just awful.<br/><br/>And when he was done and we made up his demon he said something like, "This guy has strong control of his demon.  If he loses control of that demon; he's fucked."<br/><br/>And I said, "AHA! And that fucked state is where the game happens, dad.  That is where the drama's at and where things get interesting."<br/><br/>And I could see him get kind of edgy and uncomfortable, which was interesting.  I had encouraged him to create this thing and he had never played these games.  The boundaries of who controlled what was not clear to him.  When he lost control of that demon, he got uncomfortable (and rightfully so).<br/><br/>It was an awesome response.

This is the essence of improvisation. You say something, then I add what happens next, then you declare the next event, etc. (RPGs certainly allow for open negotiation, but the point is that normal RPG play doesn't revisit an event after it's been established.) This is why the entire concept of IIEE---a sequence outlining how events are established---exists.<br/><br/>Story-boarding (in my mind) represents those times when the players abandon the "sequential" process and just start brainstorming or negotiating events.<br/><br/>So Jesse's "IIEE w/o teeth" example isn't story-boarding because the IIEE process was maintained, even if details were left out. His later examples are story-boarding because the IIEE process was basically thrown out the window.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233189/#Comment_233189" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-19T10:25:24+00:00" title="September 19, 2009 10:25AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wouldn't that make Polaris a storyboarding game?<br/><br/>"I kill your demon steed"<br/>"But only if your lover who is 5,000 miles away dies of plague"<br/>"But only if there's an earthquake that causes the north tower to collapse"<br/>"But only if you marry Cerberus's sister"<br/>etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233209/#Comment_233209" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-19T13:44:58+00:00" title="September 19, 2009  1:44PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2009 7:08AM by timfire.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: demiurgeastaroth</cite>Wouldn't that make Polaris a storyboarding game?</blockquote>\nIf you played <i>Polaris</i> like that, I think it would feel very story-board-y (as I understand the term). But is that type of negotiation actually acceptable according to rules? It's been quite awhile since I played the game or read the book, but my memory is that negotiations should represent some sort of natural extension or consequence of the conflict at  hand.<br/><br/>If the negotiations remain confined to fleshing out the conflict at hand, than <i>Polaris'</i> Key Phrases are just a way of structuring the informal negotiations that happen all the time in RPGs. It's when players begin trying to suggest stuff outside the current conflict/situation that I feel play begins crossing the line into story-boarding.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?<br/><br/>[edit]<br/>So using your example, "your lover who is 5,000 miles away dies of plague" is in no way a logical extension or consequence of "I kill your demon steed". Thus I would consider that story-boarding.<br/><br/>Compare that to "I kill your demon steed... but only if your starlight sword is destroyed (in the process)... but only if you get lost in the wastelands (without your steed to guide you)". Those two conditions would seem to be very logical consequences of an attack on the player's demon steed.<br/>[/edit]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233238/#Comment_233238" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-19T22:22:55+00:00" title="September 19, 2009 10:22PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tim has nailed my take on Polaris.

Hopefully, he'll correct me if I'm wrong.<br/><br/>When people make statements like those I suggested, one of two things usually happens IME: *someone* finds a way to tie them into causality or continuity (maybe the person who proposed them has a plan and introduced them for a reason, or maybe someone else sees the opportunity to incorporate and build on them), or they just sort of die, ignored because no-one really cares (kind of like capes when you suggest conflicts no-one is interested in).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233437/#Comment_233437" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T09:52:22+00:00" title="September 21, 2009  9:52AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2009 9:53AM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Demi,<br/><br/>One cool thing that could happen, maybe maybe, is using your version of continuity for Polaris (i.e. not strictly causal) but then using a time lapse.<br/><br/>In this example (told as continuous narrative): Sir Pictor the Star Knight has finally caught up to the demon-ridden ghoul who was once his sworn brother-in-arms, Sir Octans. They fight, and Sir Pictor lands a lethal blow on the mount of Sir Octans, slaying the beast instantly; this of course cements his victory over his foe. Upon returning home, aglow with quiet triumph, Sir Pictor's joy is dashed upon learning that plague has broken out in the West Tower, where his new wife was awaiting his return. He tears away his armor in a rush, charges up the stairs to their room, and throws open the door... only to find a physician-priest already administering Last Rites to the sweet young woman, her face and limbs ravaged by the plague.<br/><br/>So that's a thing - maybe if you establish the threat of plague, in advance of the actual discovery of said lover dying of said plague, then this could work. All you'd have to do, in effect, is to solidify your "But Only If ... your lover, 5000 miles away, dies of plague" with Key Phrases like "But Only If ... you hear rumors of plague in the West", and maybe "But Only If... the illness takes young and old alike". <br/><br/>I'm more or less saying that there's a difference between being totally disconnected and actually using the emotional pitch of a situation to create some kind of counterpoint - Sir Pictor's player will know well in advance that the Lady Corvus (we'll say) is doomed to die of plague; the intervening scenes between that But Only If statement and the in-game revelation of her death need to help establish plague, where the plague struck, etc. <br/><br/>This is somewhat akin to the tone of the Questing Beast mechanic of the Idea - you're struck by inspiration but can't necessarily tie things into the immediate circumstances or scene, so you hold off until you can properly introduce the new plot point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233458/#Comment_233458" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T11:33:19+00:00" title="September 21, 2009 11:33AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2009 12:15PM by timfire.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If we're just talking about isolated instances of seemingly random "But Only If..." conditions, the discussion is going to become murky rather quickly.

Typically, a situation like that would be role-played out, with players advocating for the Heart / Moons / Mistaken, before having its own dedicated conflict negotiation. But the players are skipping over the normal play procedure, and just outlining how they want events to unfold.

Its exactly this freedom that enables you to be really aggressive in asking "even NOW?" as you push your opponent's buttons.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes it work particularly well in Polaris is that there is the entire fate / destiny mythical quality to the setting.  That sort of inevitability of the end means there really aren't any unrelated events.  OF COURSE, the rift between the royal couple was triggered by the death of the demon steed...no one else may realize it but in the mythical setting of the Far North things like that just happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the Mistaken represents all of the karmic forces of the universe that are out to screw your character.  It may seem, from the narrow perspective of your character that things are unrelated...but to the the demonic forces who are omni aware and omni present...its all part of the same beat down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly in PTA the tropes of playing a TV show and the tacit recognition that OF COURSE that's the kind of discussion teams of script writers have as they plot point out the next several episodes make it easy to do as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther games might not have such ready made points of entry for such overt storyboarding tactics, but that just means you need to be a little more careful and subtle in how you go about it.

Or if I'm the 2, the scene was framed for someone else's issue and my involvement is secondary.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither way, this scene, for me, is definitively NOT about busting some thugs or sniffing out a stash.  That's merely the excuse for ramping up the tension on my issue.  So...how could a scene about confronting an armed thug on the street get amped up in a way that would draw the ire of the chief?..."how about he shoots my dog, which is a violation of procedure because I should have ensured the scene was secure before bringing out the dog, and that violation comes to the Chief's attention and he uses it to throw the book at me?"  would absolutely be something I'd be comfortable offering out as stakes...what's at stake is "do I give my boss another excuse to ream me out".<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd also be comfortable with a little bit of brainstorming around the table to refine it further...especially in terms of discussing the ramifications for the overall spot light arc.  If this was my SpotLight 3 episode then actually getting fired over the issue would be more reasonably on the table than if this was my SpotLight 2 episode.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's what I mean by the central conceit of PTA being a TV show making it easy and completely sensible to be thinking about things in this fashion.  I personally, can't concieve of NOT thinking about things this way when playing PTA...for me that would defeat the whole point of playing PTA...might as well play some other game that isn't about making it feel like a TV show.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for me its a different conceit than Polaris, but its the same idea.  The game's core premise lends itself very well to being thought about in this broader arc fashion.  PTA because its a TV show with all of the structure around determining "who shot J.R." that a TV show involves.  Polaris because its a deeply symbolic mythical almost dream like setting where such seeming incongruencies feel completely natural.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233538/#Comment_233538" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T17:17:51+00:00" title="September 21, 2009  5:17PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph,<br><br>I'm mulling this over because in Polaris that kind of thing annoys me but I don't think it's necessarily "wrong" per se.  Further, I'd be okay with it if I can see the emotional tie in the jump.  Which I think is really the problem.  If I can't see your "But only if..." fitting in the same thematic montage than to me you're just trying to sneak something in and by passing the actual developing creative dialogue.

You've phrased it in a fairly negative light.  But I don't think its any more damaging to social dynamics or more likely to lead to dysfunctional play than any other social dynamic at the table.  I'd also suggest that I find such maneuverings far more emotionally honest than many other FtF social dynamics I've experienced at the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then I don't have a problem with the Macho Nar Yanger label either.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Polaris I'd love a game where the goal I've been fighting for the entire game...slaying this demon...is narratively within my grasp...but only if I sacrifice the life of the woman I love.  Its like Dogs' "Even Now?" paradigm cranked up to 11.  The cranked up to 11 part is because there is no need to manipulate the story so that there's some visible cause and effect tieing the death of the demon to the death of the lover.  You don't have to force the fiction to get there...and you don't have to "just play" and hope that eventually the fiction will let you get to somewhere that good.  You can right now...right this very instant...take the most emotionally powerful, sob threatening, heart wrenching dillema you can think of based on everything you know about how to push the buttons of the player across the table from you...and hit it...hard and repeatedly.   Getting good enough at it to recognize when the result will be powerful and moving, and when it will be lame and sucky is a talent that requires developing...but man...it is the awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nPTA you have different mechanics but the same situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a theory that suggests that one of the reasons for opposition to storyboarding techniques in play is that its not safe.  It puts your character image at risk.  Not just his stats, or his hit points, or his mechanical effectiveness, but who the character is down deep in their soul in the hands of the table, and the end result is you as a player may be forced to reconcile who you thought your character was as a person, with who the character was revealed to be after the table got done putting him through the crucible.  Playing the fiction moment to moment is safer.  You can see the direction events are going, things are forshadowed in a way that gives you a greater option to backout or find another path, it leaves more of the choices of your character in your hands and to an extent allows you to be the final keeper of that character's soul.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you go to more story boarding and direct story manipulation play...you are automatically, almost by definition, increasing the vulnerability of your character.  Its no longer just up to you to decide who your character is, but the entire table now gets a say in who your character is, by what suggestions they make for stakes, or what dillemas they put your character in etc. etc.  In the end, play becomes as much about discovering who the other players perceive your character to be as who you are trying to portray him to be.  I REALLY REALLY love that.  And story boarding techniques is one technique that is particularly good at delivering that sort of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm reminded of our recent game of IaWA.  There's not an overt story board driver in IaWA the way there is in Polaris or PTA...but there is a covert driver in the group brainstorming of oracle interpretations and Best Interests at the beginning of play, how that feeds into the types of scenes the GM sets during play and, most powerfully, in how you wield the Stick.  The Stick is one of the greatest tools of this nature since "But only if".  Its your chance to force the other player to accept a truth...a truth that you select...if they don't want to lose mechanical effectiveness.  Man.  I remember my primary character struggling throughout play to be the ruthless but noble Cardinal Richelieu-esque character I'd envisioned against others attempts to make him more smarmy and questionably motivated.  I largely won that struggle in the end.  Keith's primary character however...pretty much became our ongoing villain...sick, twisted, and creepy...despite Keith's best efforts to portray him as noble and honestly in love.  That struggle made the moments of redemption so much more powerful, and made Keith's character one of the most memorable I've ever seen portrayed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you played Showdown Jesse?  In that game the entire object of play is to claim your opponent's character, rip out its soul, step on it, and hand it back to them broken...having earned with a die roll the right to ruin the other players image of their character as a hero and instead reveal as proven fact in the fiction that they are...whatever you think they will find most distasteful.  Its very liberating as a roleplaying exercise to try to create the coolest most amazing "I love this character" character you can, one who holds to the archetypical ideals you find yourself playing most frequently...and then experience that horrible knot in the pit of your stomach as play reveals him to be an absolute heel, of exactly the sort your friend knows you abhor...and there is very little you can do to stop it...except accept death gracefully and let your hated rival win.  And so the game becomes this ingenious test of how badly do you want to win...and therefor how much are you willing to risk your character being destroyed in the process.  Its so much more effective if you start with a character you actually love.<br/>\n<br/>\nStoryboarding isn't the only technique that gives other players this level of input into your character...but its one of the most effective ways of getting reliably to the point of being able to ask player to player "Even Now?" and know that you're pushing exactly the right buttons to make that a hard question to answer...especially when both answers say something about your character you're not sure you want to admit about them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight technique for every game design?  Of course not...but highly effective, extremely powerful tool as every bit as legitimate and worthy of concideration as any other design tool we have available...absofragginlutely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang" title="Tim C Koppang"><img alt="Tim C Koppang" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim%20C%20Koppang">Tim C Koppang</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233690/#Comment_233690" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-22T12:57:46+00:00" title="September 22, 2009 12:57PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph,<br><br>That's interesting.  However, I've actually been thinking about story-boarding as the "safer" option.  Not from a character-ownership point of view, but from a player interaction POV.  With story-boarding, the players are arriving at a consensus before committing any action to the game.  Thus, a meeker player can feel "safe" knowing that his contributions won't "ruin" the game.  When you're playing moment to moment, you have to put yourself out there and make a commitment to the story.  This creates a powerful dialogue in my experience, but can be nerve-racking if you're feeling insecure about the merit of your creativity.<br><br>- Tim                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233708/#Comment_233708" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-22T14:20:26+00:00" title="September 22, 2009  2:20PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, Ralph, you're interpreting things <i>WAY</i> differently than I do. There are a number of things I want to respond to in your post, but I'll try to cut to the heart of it first:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ralph (Valamir)</cite>When you go to more story boarding and direct story manipulation play...</blockquote>\nI think you have a much different concept of "story-boarding" than I do. My understanding of "story-boarding" doesn't necessarily involve "direct story manipulation". Correct me if I'm misunderstanding you, but "direct story manipulation play" just sounds like director stance and/or shared authority, which are techniques employed by lots of games.<br><br>My concept of "story-boarding" is something different than "normal" RPG play. Again, my understanding involves a shift in the way IIEE and the general "sequential"/procedural nature of play works. The most obvious example I can think of would be when a group pre-outlines a scene, usually in some informal manner.<br><br>That's where my made-up PTA example came from. It's the whole "pre-narration" issue that people have been complaining about for years now. Instead of letting the situation play out normally, people use stakes-setting to outline how they want things (beyond the conflict) to go.<br><br>Now just to be clear, I don't mean to imply that story-boarding is inherently bad. If we're talking about the big picture, story-boarding is a perfectly fine technique, and I would love to see a game designed it. But the issue---IMO---is that my concept of story-boarding represents a significantly <i>different</i> mode of play, and I'm very wary of trying to mix it into "traditional" play.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ralph (Valamir)</cite>In Polaris I'd love a game where the goal I've been fighting for the entire game...slaying this demon...is narratively within my grasp...but only if I sacrifice the life of the woman I love. Its like Dogs' "Even Now?...</blockquote>\n*IF* we were playing a game that had some sort of "love" or "personal happiness" theme going, and the end of the game came down to, "I slay the dragon... but only if your lover dies of the plague..." Man, that would be awesome.<br><br>Like I said, "continuity" and "causality" are context-specific. In that hypothetical <i>Polaris</i> game, the "but only if your lover dies" condition acts as a continuation/escalation of an already established theme.<br><br>But the way I read my <i>Polaris</i> example is that it's more than just an "Even Now?" escalation. To me, it feels like it starts as an escalation, but quickly takes a 90 degree turn into a tangent about the King an Queen. And in taking that turn, the players bypass the normal procedures of play.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tim C Koppang</cite>I've actually been thinking about story-boarding as the "safer" option.</blockquote>\nI'm with the other Tim K here. If a group story-boards a scene ahead of time, the players can enter the scene knowing what to expect. But if they're playing moment-to-moment, a player might get a couple steps down the line and realize they've been backed into a (creative) corner---for bad or good.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233716/#Comment_233716" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-22T14:47:25+00:00" title="September 22, 2009  2:47PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tim and Tim (and others): Is "outlining the entire scene, including it's likely endpoint, before playing it" a fair approximation of what you're calling storyboarding?<br><br><br>James                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233766/#Comment_233766" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-22T21:53:16+00:00" title="September 22, 2009  9:53PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was Jesse's working definition for this thread at least:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Storyboarding (as I mean it) requires one player reaching over and moving around bits that don\u2019t belong to him in order to establish a plot point of their personal preference.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233784/#Comment_233784" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-23T00:27:59+00:00" title="September 23, 2009 12:27AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>This was Jesse's working definition for this thread at least:<br><br><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Storyboarding (as I mean it) requires one player reaching over and moving around bits that don\u2019t belong to him in order to establish a plot point of their personal preference.</br></br></blockquote>\nYeah, I know.

And as you might guess, that's causing a lot of confusion and miscommunication.<br><br>Now, I have to say that I find the whole "story-boarding is just another technique" line to be, uh... <i>unsatisfying</i>. The term was originally conceived to describe unfun play, right? So any proposed definition has to explain why the technique(s) is generating unfun play.<br><br>Furthermore, the term also implies a certain, umm... "emotional distance" between the player and the fiction, right? That's the purpose of comparing play to a boardgame, right? So we need a way to explain that phenomenon as well.<br/>___________________<br/><br/>Jesse's definition involves players crossing borders of authority.<br/><br/>That would certainly explain unfun play, but you would think that if that was the issue, people would be complaining about player-to-player tension, not "emotional distance" from the fiction.<br/>___________________<br/><br/>Ralph's definition---if I understand him---involves "direct story manipulation".<br/><br/>Since some players have long complained that "meta play" pulls them out of the fiction, Ralph's explanation is certainly plausible. But personally, I'm not sold on that idea. IME, the ability to "meta think" is a learned skill. Sure, it feel weird at first, but after a while it just becomes the way you operate. Personally, I've internalized the skill so much that I can't even see a distinction any more.<br/>___________________<br/><br/>My definition involves a shift in the way IIEE and the general procedural nature of play works. This is going to take some explaining:<br/><br/>I believe that improvisation and "composition" (aka "normal" authorship) represents two distinct modes of the creation. As such, each mode presents its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Traditional RPG play is inherently improvisational. In fact, it seems structured to maximize the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of improvisation.<br/><br/>Now, I would argue that the <i>immediacy</i> of the fiction that we experience when role-playing---stuff like the heightened sense of character identification---is largely a byproduct of improvisational play. This is where my understanding of "story-boarding" comes from.<br/><br/>Normal play is built "sequentially" or "procedurally", one event on top of the last. I would call story-boarding those times when players step off to the side and develop multiple events all in unison, and then pop them back into the sequence. In other words, they hit the "improvisational pause" button, and begin engaging in "compositional" play.<br/><br/>In the big picture, this is a perfectly fine technique, but there is a trade-off that players must be aware of. The players gain the advantages of "composition", but they lose the advantages of improvisation. And since the "immediacy" of the fiction is one of those things gained by improvisation, it's one of the things players lose by switching modes.<br/><br/>And that seems to explain what people are complaining about with "story-boarding".                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233827/#Comment_233827" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-23T07:37:00+00:00" title="September 23, 2009  7:37AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: blankshield</cite>Tim and Tim (and others): Is "outlining the entire scene, including it's likely endpoint, before playing it" a fair approximation of what you're calling storyboarding?</blockquote>\nMy own understanding isn't quite that simple.<br/><br/>Let's say you have a game, like... heck, <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, that broadly outlines the goals of various scenes or acts. But in games like that, the ending of the scenes/acts isn't what's important for play, it's all the interactions and such in the middle that's important.<br/><br/>Compare that to my earlier PTA or Polaris examples. In those made-up situations, the players are actually outlining the stuff that's intended to be important.<br/><br/>Do you see that distinction I'm trying to make? I wouldn't call the former story-boarding, but I would the latter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233831/#Comment_233831" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-23T08:03:49+00:00" title="September 23, 2009  8:03AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tim, I'm totally fine with the construct you outline here.  That matches both what I do when I play and what I can glean from AP reports that touch on such things.  I'd say the "step off to the side" phase can be as brief as one sentence thrown into the middle of "sequential" play peanut-gallery style by a player who's more "compositionally aware" at that point.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact I'd say the quick "one eye on the character, one eye tossing a couple of ideas around, and then back down to both eyes on the character" is far more common than a clean seperation between sequential mode and composition mode.  The clean break style is more noticeable, particularly when its tied procedurally to Scene Framing or Stakes Setting events.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm pretty convinced that these things are functionally identical and what is really being objected to is how profound the break is, not the activity that is being performed (and labeled "story boarding") during the break.  In other words, its not the activity that's troublesome its the structure some games build around the activity that's troublesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that, for me, is where it comes down to using the right tool for the right job.  There are occassions when putting a structure around that activity is going to work exceedingly well and be exactly the right design choice.  There are occassions when putting structure around that activity is going to not work so well...just like any other design tool or play technique.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I object to is misdiagnosing personal play preferences as fundamental design paradigms.  Put story boarding in the category of "something to be aware of when you're designing a game so you can be sure the way your game handles it is a deliberate choice" and I'm all in favor of that.  Put it in the category of "this is bad and should be avoided because it leads to lame flat fiction" and I'll tell you to blow it out your ear.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then I've made the same arguement about "the Explicit Stakes Setting is bad" meme when that was a "ohnoes badwrongfun" topic awhile back".  And also about the "you need to have a Fruitful Void and make sure you don't trample on it" meme which seems to be rearing its ugly head again.  Some games are best served by explicit stakes setting.  Some games are best served by filling the void in.  Both are things that should be in the "be aware of this issue" category.  Neither are fundamental design truths to be followed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
