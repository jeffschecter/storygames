I can see all the parts I like about Capes peeking through and improved on.  I especially like the potential for puzzle-y setups of countdown and staged threats.<br/><br/>Suspense scenes also seem awesome, but I'm curious how they actually play out.  It seems odd to have a players scrambling for danger dice, or taking damage in a library investigation.  Do you mostly do stress-type damage (tired, confused, etc)?  Or have occasional mook-level encounters as threat moves (you're taking rubbings from the ancient cave when a brief firefight breaks out and you're shot before killing the mooks)?  Can threat moves introduce new questions, or are all the new threats postponed until the next action scene?  Is there any chance for a question to remain a mystery (like a countdown threat, maybe?)?  I almost want them to shift to action scenes directly (once we know who the mysterious figure it, we have a huge fight with him, then come back to the rest of the mysteries later.)<br/><br/>I guess I'm just curious how they play out, maybe a link to some AP reports?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325168/#Comment_325168" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T14:24:36+00:00" title="May 18, 2011  2:24PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 18, 2011 2:26PM by stupidgremlin.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Suspence scenes have been one of the things thats been the most difficult for me to run, simply becuase there aren't as many examples in the rules about how they work.<br/>Generally, I've dealt with them like so:<br/>Danger dice represents potential complications from your research/dealings/inventions, such as running out of supplies, taking too long, or making your contacts irritated for asking so many questions. As you earn Danger, conditions will be appropriate to the situation, like "Wrong Turn," or "Deceived!," or "Out of Batteries!" I've made the Threat Moves also something appropriate to the situation, such as introducing new questions or possibly red herrings ("Is the Black Hood actually the Mayor?"), or forcing the player to change locations to continue his research somewhere else ("Well, I've exhausted all the research materials at Rocket City Library, so I guess I better check at the newspaper to see if they know anything!") Some of the Danger gets saved up to introduce new Threats in the next Action scene ("Well, Captain Atom, it looks like your investigations have angered the local Martian Tong, and they've sent their enforcers to teach you some manners!")<br/><br/>I really should write some of my examples down, sometime.<br/><br/><br/>EDIT: Oh, yeah, and if the player gets 5 Danger, then the situation goes unresolved, and goes straight to an Action Scene!<br/>I do it this way, simply because on three separate ocassions, a player would roll massive amounts of Danger, and it just kept dragging on and on until they finally succeeded.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325233/#Comment_325233" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-18T18:45:33+00:00" title="May 18, 2011  6:45PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, they really never quite got figured out in the beta.
