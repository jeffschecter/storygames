How do y'all deal with players trying to cover up their tracks, essentially trying conceal an action from NPCs or the world at large in order to avoid potential negative consequences?<br/><br/>Example: During our last session, the players killed an assassin who worked for a powerful family. This took place at night in the city where the said powerful family operates. After the deed, one of the players stated a fact that "It is very dark." and all the players wore hoods. Given these facts, I feel like to preserve player agency (is there a better term?) I cannot treat the murder as having been witnessed by anyone, so the players essentially suffer no consequences because they were clearly trying to cover their tracks. However, this seems like it precludes interesting things from happening, for example the said powerful family (Donati) finding out that their favorite assassin was killed by the players and deciding to make an example of what happens to people who interfere with their business.<br/><br/>Is can perhaps see this being a good opportunity for some sort of an ability test. In Donjon, let's say the player's Cerebrality + pertinent hiding Ability vs. an Easy (or even Very Easy) difficulty to not be recognized at night while wearing a hood. If they fail, I get to state a fact "Someone recognizes you." However, in the very likely chance that they all succeed, that still means a whole branch of potentially exciting play (dealing with whoever the Donati send after the players, perhaps trying to negotiate with the Donati to end hostilities, etc.) is crossed out based on one roll. On the other hand, disregarding their obvious choice not to have such consequences feels like Railroading. Or is that just an instance of overly-cautious players who have not yet realized that more drama and more danger mean more fun for everybody, and I should not be a party to their turtling?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417477/#Comment_417477" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-29T10:12:59+00:00" title="June 29, 2013 10:12AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even if the Donatis can't prove the PCs did it, they will soon know someone did it, even if no body surfaces. Presumably, this will set events in motion, even if it doesn't immediately point to the PCs.<br/><br/>The Donatis are likely to make an example of someone, that someone being whoever seems the most likely culprit. They may even do some investigation first, probably heading to the last known place their assassin was seen alive.<br/><br/>So actually, yeah, there's a lot that can still be done. If the PCs aren't prime suspects, they may have accidently touched off some kind of feud or street war as the Donatis go after a more likely suspect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AllanDotson" title="AllanDotson"><img alt="AllanDotson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/587/nCEFJQOAECTHQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AllanDotson">AllanDotson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417478/#Comment_417478" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-29T10:30:53+00:00" title="June 29, 2013 10:30AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see some possible consequences even if the players weren't recognized.  A witness could still have seen a group of figures in hoods (any other distinguishing features?  Is one of the characters tall, short, or carry a polearm?).  The Donatis put pressure on the city watch, and now the city is on high alert, the watch is questioning everyone (especially strangers and travelers) about their wherabouts that night.  Maybe the roads and city gates are even closed.  The patrols double, and the city is now better lit at night.<br/><br/>I don't know what kind of magic is available in Donjon, or common in your setting, but the the assassin's ghost could finger the PCs as his murderer.  Could the Donatis potentially hire a spirit medium or diviner, or even a non-magical tracker or detective to find the killers?  You don't even have to have this detective actually find the PCs, just have them hear that this awesome detective is coming to the city to solve the crime, and let the players react.  <br/><br/>Maybe someone else gets blamed for the murder.  Will the PCs care if an innocent man is going to hang for their crime?<br/><br/>If the assassin was a valuable asset to the Donati family, then rival families might make their move now that the assassin is dead.  The balance of power in the city could be disrupted.  <br/><br/>Most of these ideas have to do with consequences to the world around the characters, rather than consequences to them directly.  This way, they still got away with murder (preserving player agency, since that's what they wanted), but their action has ripple effects on the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417480/#Comment_417480" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-29T12:26:19+00:00" title="June 29, 2013 12:26PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do the players have NPC attachments?

I entirely failed to consider that whether PCs are involved or not, the interested parties will react in some way. I think there is definitely a possibility of a bloodier feud between the two families (the ones who hired the assassin and his victim's family), plus other families could get involved or implicated. This opens up a whole range of very exciting possibilities, perhaps even more exciting than having the PCs be at the epicenter.\n<blockquote>I can see some possible consequences even if the players weren't recognized.  A witness could still have seen a group of figures in hoods (any other distinguishing features?  Is one of the characters tall, short, or carry a polearm?).<br/>[snip]<br/>Could the Donatis potentially hire a spirit medium or diviner, or even a non-magical tracker or detective to find the killers?  You don't even have to have this detective actually find the PCs, just have them hear that this awesome detective is coming to the city to solve the crime, and let the players react.</blockquote>\nI really like both of these, especially the second one; it could turn into a very satisfying cat-and-mouse game where the players will be in the less familiar mouse role. Very intriguing. Thank you! I think the non-magical tracker or detective on the players' trails is golden. \n<blockquote>Do the players have NPC attachments? (This is a maybe, I suspect, as that playstyle tends to go hand-in-hand with "I don't have any ties you can't get me that way.") If so, said stuff that komradebob is talking about can start catching them (and other innocents) in the blast zone, even if it totally misses the PCs.</blockquote>\nYou suspect correctly, and the players are very averse to attachments of any kind. This time I tried to have at least some attachments built-in, so one player at least has family in the city (rivals to the victim of the assassination, so going to be interesting), and I essentially saddled them with a patron from another powerful family, which also could be caught in the blast wave.<br/><br/>JDCorley, thank you for the suggestions, and I'm sorry I was not clear. Because players specifically tried to avoid detection, I do not want to spring a witness at them, since that would essentially deprive them of agency to affect the world in meaningful way. I will keep them in mind for when there is a witness, however.<br/><br/>noclue: The Donati don't think of anything yet, since this just happened as the players are going on an adventure outside of the city. If, on the other hand, your question was meant to get me to think from the perspective of the Donati family, I will certainly do so now. Something will be brewing by the time the players come back to the city.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417489/#Comment_417489" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-29T16:48:59+00:00" title="June 29, 2013  4:48PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ahh, sorry, I re-read.

And if you really want to put PCs in a spot, consider making them aware of some other evidence they could have plausibly left behind \u2013\xa0something they dropped, or blood spilled from them (if they were harmed at all in combat). Maybe this game doesn't have DNA evidence, but is there magic that allows you to track them with a bit of their blood? This (or even the rumor that this is possible, concocted by the authorities to draw out the murderers) may encourage the PCs to try to tamper with the evidence.<br/><br/>I had a group of PCs in very similar circumstances in a game of In Nomine (caught on security video using supernatural powers to burn a man to death who turned out to be a human cop, not the demon they suspected). It nearly kicked off a street war between angels and demons, and the PCs had the new goal of trying to find and destroy the video evidence (which they failed at). In the end, the only way the PCs could use diplomacy to prevent a battle with scores of bystander casualties was to turn themselves in to appease the other side. The tensest scene in any game I've ever run involved a room full of immortals realizing they were about to accept life imprisonment just to "do the right thing." (They got off easy in that case, with an ally providing non-sentient body doubles to take their places, but I could see a "prison break" storyline being pretty cool too.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417684/#Comment_417684" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-02T18:13:25+00:00" title="July  2, 2013  6:13PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2013 6:13PM by noclue.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Assassin was just a ruse to flush them out anyway.

In fact, I might have just the ally that could get implicated in the murder, one whom the PCs would want to clear because of obligations and/or guilt. It is quite evil, though, as komdradebob says.\n<blockquote><blockquote>I'm a big fan of twists that make the killers say, "Man, I really wish we hadn't killed that guy, this just made everything way more complicated."</blockquote>\nMe too.  I like for violence, especially against people in a city to have consequences beyond what you get for killing monsters in the wild.  I also like revealing that the dead guy had information the PCs now need. </blockquote>\nThat's definitely something I would like to cultivate as well, though I feel like this particular campaign might prove a bit difficult in that regard, since I suspect many adversaries will be human rather than monsters.\n<blockquote>The Donati don't have wizard trackers?</blockquote>\nWell, not so much. I'm trying out a low-magic setting set in something akin to Renaissance Florence (I wrote a bit about it <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18547/donjon-low-magic-world-with-weird-tales-feel" rel="nofollow">in another thread some time ago</a>), so while magic exists and there are sorcerers and wizards, I cannot see them offering their services for hire. Although, come to think of it, them consulting a fortuneteller might not be a bad idea.<br/><br/>JasonT, that does sound like an intense moment. That's an interesting idea about blood; there is certainly a lot of folklore about blood and its powers to make it into even a low-magic campaign. I need to pay more heed to the less flashy magic (fortunetelling, sympathetic magic, etc.) for this, I think.\n<blockquote>The Assassin was just a ruse to flush them out anyway. And they were dumb enough to take the bait.</blockquote>\nHaha, that goes right up there on the list of evil things to do to players. I will have to remember it for when they're a bit older, this being their first adventure and all. Very nice twist to a "victory."<br/><br/>Thank you all for the great suggestions! I am looking forward to incorporating several in the immediate future. For this particular episode I am leaning toward an innocent NPC (who happens to be a teenager and following the PCs) being blamed or at least suspected in the murder.

Or if they don't know what happened, what changes would they notice in their situation, and how would they respond?<br/>- What plans/relationships/delicate balances were disrupted when this happened? Will anyone try to fix things or take advantage of the situation?<br/>- What, if anything, will make it hard for PCs to keep their role in this a secret? What opportunities can I give the players to show how their PCs are feeling about this?<br/>- What reactions (from the NPCs, the PCs, and/or the world) are going to give the PCs something interesting to interact with? (Preferably, something that they could react to in so many different ways that I will be delightfully surprised by what they do, because that is one of the greatest things about GMing a game.)<br/><br/>Generally that serves me pretty well; it's rare that I can't find something good to work with just with the materials on hand in the game setting, so I'm satisfied to draw my line there and steer well clear of more arbitrary-seeming comeuppances or cheap shots.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417852/#Comment_417852" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-06T08:16:10+00:00" title="July  6, 2013  8:16AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 6, 2013 8:16AM by Paul_T.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>So, maybe a tangential question: Where do you draw the line between "let them have their victory" and "show them the consequences of their actions"?

No matter what, your job as the GM is to show interesting, impactful, exciting consequences to their actions. You decide whether that means they get into deep trouble (didn't think of how this would affect the ________ of the city), or whether it means the whole landscape of play changes, instead. It can be about new threats or it can be about new opportunities, instead.<br/><br/>The important part is that they've made a plan and carried it through: now the ball's in your court to show how things have changed as a result. The worst answer is that it hasn't. Show how their actions have changed *everything*, whether for better or for worse. What are the ramifications? How are other people affected? How does it impact their business, or their families, or local politics?

So, in a way, the division I made above isn't really appropriate \u2013\xa0you should "show them the consequences of their action" no matter what, as that's not mutually exclusive with "let them have their victory." If you look at it from a few sensible angles, though \u2013\xa0like those <a href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">@AccountingForTaste</a> offers \u2013 you might find that the logical consequences are some that point to the PCs being in just as much trouble as before (if a different kind of trouble, now).<br/><br/>And in case it's helpful/relevant: The distinction I was drawing between "storytellers" and "power gamers" is actually based on that same In Nomine group I was describing above. Sometimes they try to limit exposure to problems and conflict not because it's what sensible characters would do, but because they (the players) come from a more video games/board gaming background of trying to "win" or "beat the game." A game with minimal conflict is easier to "win" at, but a story with minimal conflict is just boring. When my players are open to telling interesting stories (and they often are, when they remember to relax about it!), they roll with the consequences of their actions better, welcoming conflict just because it makes things fun and interesting (e.g., when a PC with a secret identity as a businessman got a text on his phone while sneaking up on someone, and happily integrated the out-of-character joke about his phone bleeping wildly and spooking his quarry).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417860/#Comment_417860" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-06T10:54:15+00:00" title="July  6, 2013 10:54AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's right.

But they can be negative (blowback, collateral damage, getting into more trouble) or positive (the world has changed, new opportunities exist, someone who needed help benefits from the change). I don't think there's a rule for which you should pick at any given time, but a good game should have a balance of both, I think. <br/><br/>As for the whole "power gamer" thing, I follow what you're saying, but I'm not sure how it should impact your own decision-making in this case. It's your job to create interesting but believable consequences, either way. Of course, it's great when the players help you out like that! (A good middle ground is to lead them there, by the way: tell them that a problem exists, but ask them to help define it. For instance, you might ask: "So, who do you think is most pissed off by what you did?" Most players won't hesitate to say, "Oh, man, the mayor will probably be enraged when he finds out about this! What are we going to do?" And they'll usually come up with something you didn't think of, so it's great material for the GM.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417869/#Comment_417869" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-06T11:56:52+00:00" title="July  6, 2013 11:56AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, good advice, thanks.
