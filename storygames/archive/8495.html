You write up things you'd like to see happen on index cards, maybe with player suggestions and then your players draw a card. They get some kind of reward (Fate Points, XP...) if they make it happen and possibly an even greater reward if they make it happen for another player.<br/><br/>Anyone recall what that was and where I might have seen that.<br/><br/>Anyway, to stay on topic. You could basically do it like that - an Index card for each achievement, and when someone get's it he might even get an additional reward. You could also make them exclusive - so that there's only one or so of a kind if you would want to do that.<br/><br/>In eIther case, it's a really interesting idea...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188356/#Comment_188356" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-14T16:06:14+00:00" title="January 14, 2009  4:06PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/ArmorGames/achievement-unlocked" rel="nofollow">Achievement Unlocked</a><br/><br/>Play this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188375/#Comment_188375" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-14T18:17:50+00:00" title="January 14, 2009  6:17PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Poison'd did it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188378/#Comment_188378" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-14T18:35:30+00:00" title="January 14, 2009  6:35PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2009 6:36PM by JuddG.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Swashbuckling Achievements:\n<ul>\n<li>A Little Light Swinging - Swinging from a chandelier.</li>\n<li>Run'er a'Midships - the first boarding action</li>\n<li>Beat to Quarters - the first time you order a sea combat attack</li>\n<li>Thirsty Work - fighting with a stein of ale in your off hand</li>\n<li>Slobbery Greetings - kissing a beautiful lady's hand</li>\n<li>Great dental work! - the first person to imitate the glint of their teeth when they smile</li>\n<li>May be play through?

I mean, part of the appeal of achievements in a computer game is that they also share things in common with easter eggs: getting an achievement by accident, 'just by playing the game', is the kind of archetypal moment. Getting obscure achievements that other people might not even have thought existed. So does the GM create a hidden list? I think that in a tabletop RPG this would feel a bit weird, kind of out-of-synch with the way the rest of play was happening.

The first time you kill a monster, your first child, the first time you go over the horizon in your boat, whatever makes sense.  If there's a tangible reward, it makes sense both in game and metagame to pursue things you ought to be pursuing to be a complete and respected person in that society.  Until you rack up the requisite achievements, or a set number, you are still a child.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188440/#Comment_188440" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-15T05:50:38+00:00" title="January 15, 2009  5:50AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the ideas guys !

In the course of your adventure, the people you meet will become known to you first of all by their designations (The Knight of the High Tower, the Maiden of the Dark Sorrow, the Hermit of the Forest of Evening\u2026). Only later, if at all, will you learn their names. <br>As a questing character, however, you begin the game with a personal name, and in the course of your adventure you may earn a designation based on your remarkable actions. At any point in the adventure, your companions - the other players - may Award the Accolade, giving your character a designation reflecting some outstanding quality he or she has displayed or some spectacular success he or she has achieved. You may, of course, accept or reject the accolade bestowed. If you accept it, write it on your character sheet. </br></blockquote>\nAnd the Pentasystem (in progress):\n<blockquote>A path is a way of formally structuring a situation which is set up to change in particular ways, resulting in both further challenges and further opportunities. The revelation of the existence of a path can act as an "inciting moment", the event or incident which plunges the characters into the action which will make up the rest of the story.<br>There are "plot-level paths", "character-level paths" and "attribute-level paths". The distinction affects how complex the path is and how many points it has, as well as what it applies to. <br>A plot-level path can be worked on by multiple characters.  <br>A character-level path is typically a goal or dilemma relating to a specific character, and that character mainly works on it (though others can help if fictionally appropriate)... <br>An attribute-level path is typically a complication which relates to a specific attribute of a specific character, and only that character can work on it... <br><br/>The essentials of a path are:<br/>\u2022\tThere is a situation that is pregnant with possibilities for change. This is the "path".<br/>\u2022\tThere is an entry point, something which draws the character(s) onto the path.<br/>\u2022\tThere are steps along the path. Some of these may themselves be paths, some may be scenes (with conflicts), some may be sequels (without conflicts). They are conditions under which the change will occur, and which are well-defined (and known to the players, though not necessarily the characters). <br/>It may be necessary to fulfill all or only some of the conditions in order to complete the path.<br/>\u2022\tThere is an <b>attainment</b>, an upside to bringing the change about - something you can do after traversing the path that you couldn't do before, or some resource you have that you didn't have before. This may be fully or partly specified.<br/>\u2022\tThere's also a downside, a cost, a complication, an additional <b>challenge</b> that wasn't there before. This may well be a new path, or it may be a new attribute that comes into existence in the situation.<br/>\u2022\tOptionally, there may be a <b>threat</b>, a cost to not resolving the situation (traversing the path). For example, the path may be "prevent a bad thing happening". If the path is not successfully traversed, the bad thing will happen (and this will itself create new paths). The threat engages with characters' motivating attributes to make them enter the path.</br></br></br></br></br></blockquote> </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188515/#Comment_188515" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-15T14:04:52+00:00" title="January 15, 2009  2:04PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tulpa</cite><a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/ArmorGames/achievement-unlocked" rel="nofollow">Achievement Unlocked</a></blockquote>\nHe beat me to it.<br/><br/>For a good use of achievement-type gaming, see the use of taglines in The Dying Earth RPG. Gaining XP relies on working certain phrases into the game. This can be frustrating sometimes, but really does push the game towards a certain style. Perhaps you could create a giant stack of index cards and hand them out as XP or fate chips when people meet the right criteria.<br/><br/>I might have to include this idea in the next version of Console.

I've been in those games.<br/><br/>In a Stories from the Shelter game I'm running now we have "Wouldn't it be cool if..." index cards that anyone is allowed to write (what are effectively) achievements on and then set bounties on them. The bounties come from the players' own Chutzpah cache ( a Fate-like resource pool, or so I've been told) and whoever triggers the achievement gets the bounty. It worked pretty well for a while, but it has recently stagnated.

So someone can brag to their (14 year old) friends, "Look Bitches, for I am awesome: I have 5 Platinum achievements, 10 Gold achievements, and several hundred Silver and Bronze achievements". That's all. <br/><br/>And yet, for those deep into video games, there are people who simply will not buy games unless they have achievement/trophy support (this is why Sony moved from a stance of "you can include them if you want" to "all must have trophies"; someone figured that they were losing sales on games that didn't have trophies). Also, you'll find games that use them totally uncreatively, or in a "cheating" way: Deaqd Space is an awesome game, but its trophies are totally uninspired: You get them for clearing levels as normal, and for "killing X baddies". There are a few cool trophies tho, like "cleared the game using only the basic weapon", but most are "meh".<br/>And on top of that, the "cheating" way: Apparently the very shitty King Kong XBox game had some sort of achievement at a high level that you can attain for doing very little work, on the second level or something. So rentals of that game are really high, to basically get those XPs on the Gaming Cred Card, and toss the game back. Even friends of mine, who I wouldn't call "heavy gamers", rented that game for that very reason.<br/><br/>BUT, as I mentioned above, I think some of the achievements/trophies are interesting; they basically give you a look behind the scenes of a game, to behaviors that the actual designers themselves consider:<br/><br/>*Rewarding/fun : Stuff that a designer said, "Man, it would be awesome if the player actually did all the little side-quests I set up".<br/>*Integral to the 'Experience' of the Game: Basically, the stuff that you would expect to see in the genre, just reinforced: Like, the one in Left 4 Dead where you get a reward the first time you reach safety, but then step out of safety to go back and help a comerade. <br/>*Easter-egg-y : The "Irony" achievement in Bioshock, where the evil boss tells you to do something to other people; and you instead do it to him.<br/>*Extremely challenging, like wearing leg-weights at a marathon : Defeat the game using weakest weapon, etc. Defeat 1000 enemies.<br/><br/>I find the top two very interesting, especially in an RPG context. Especially the second.  My "Vampire" achievements all fall into that second category, "Integral to the 'Experience' of the game".<br/><br/>Another way of thinking about it? <b>They're Flags, but just for the GM instead of the Player</b>.  The players give their flags to the GM, who uses them to incorporate that behavior into the game. Likewise, the GM could use Achievements in this way to basically give the players a way to incorporate behaviors that the GM would like to see in the game (and of course, at their leisure: Not EVERY character needs to walk on tightropes or tell off the local governor; but there will be some that will want to).<br/><br/>I love this idea, now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188651/#Comment_188651" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T10:38:00+00:00" title="January 16, 2009 10:38AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Army of Two</i> has some of my favorite Achievements.

Yay for me, right?"<br/><br/><br/>I have to confess that I like achievements a little bit.  I like it when they make me laugh (Valve is especially good at this, especially in Team Fortress 2), and I also like it when earning them gives you fun little benefits (as in Mass Effect, where many of the achievements give you bonuses in subsequent playthroughs).  I'm not so much for the bragging anymore, though, so I don't usually pimp my profile to anyone.

Check your pulse, 'cause I'm pretty sure you're dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmack-talk and friendly rivalries are fucking awesome. When my wife got into TF2, we were constantly comparing our achievements and stats. When she'd beat me in something, I'd be like "Nice, babe!" Then I'd fiendishly try to outdo her. Then there was "How'd you get that one?? I've been playing twice as long as you, and I JUST got it!"<br/>\n<br/>\nA non-game example from recent experience: NaNoWriMo. Shane and I were smack-talkin' back and forth, which got me feeling competitive, and seeing as how I had all the time in the world, I zoomed ahead of him. It drove me to excel, and I think maybe it's what helped get him across the finish line, too. It was definitely friendly, 'cause as soon as I hit my wordcount, I turned cheerleader, and I was genuinely pleased when several other S-G chums made it. Achievements are largely the same thing. You can brag because you got it, which encourages your friends to get it too, but that doesn't lessen your accomplishment, so you can be glad for them. If you and I both have this achievement, then we're both awesome. If your score is higher than mine, then you're better than me, which may make me happy for you, but damnit, now I'm not the best, so there's a teensy bit of resentment potential.<br/>\n<br/>\nAchievements also allow you to compete against yourself. You know there's an achievement you get for healing X number of points in a single match or without dying.. And you start to want it. I got level 1. I healed 1000 points without dying. Next time, I get 990. Damn! Not as good as my best. Next time, I'm awesome, and I heal 1500, which is way better than 1000, but not good enough for level 2, which is 2000.

And every time it tells me that I set a new record for myself, I pump my fist and want to announce it to everyone within earshot.<br><br>Feedback like that is highly underrated.  Just compiling the data is cool in its own right: look at how games like the Grand Theft Auto series and various CRPGs feature stats screens listing the number of cars you stole or creatures you killed or the cash value of all the loot you ran off with.  It's stuff that you don't really keep track of for yourself, but gives you a little thrill when you hear the actual running tally.  It's such a simple, stupid little thing (which is why computers are so good at doing it), but it produces such a wonderful effect!<br><br>Admittedly, I don't know how someone could work that into a tabletop game without having to do a fuckton of note-taking, but certainly the appeal of Achievements (which are much easier to track, comparatively) is a solid one, even beyond simple bragging rights.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188880/#Comment_188880" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-18T10:46:27+00:00" title="January 18, 2009 10:46AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>My (somewhat) hypothetical "Agon revised" has Achievements, which are indeed cool little icons that you get to add to your character sheet, Xbox style.

No one, NO ONE is immune.<br/><br/>The old d6 Men in Black and DC Universe games had dialogue/action cards, where you got a bonus if you did the thing on the card.  It could be a line of dialogue or an action. Not much was done with it to my great disappointment. I like these ideas, though. Analysis Paralysis is terrific...I'm actually thinking of them as learning tools. <br/><br/>And there's no need to have them hidden from the players!

Some of them are boring like "Wipe out all the gangs" but others are more fun like "Use explosives to keep a car in the air for 7 seconds." That's an awesome achievement. So is "Blow up 25 gang members in 60 seconds."<br/><br/>Crackdown is a perfect open world game, strong in structure, light on filler, and it rewards you for exploration every step of the way, even without achievements, though earning achievements through play is still quite nice, I can jump from rooftop to rooftop all day.<br/><br/>I have problem's with Team Fortress 2's achievements. They feel like filler. Heal 1000000 hit points? Seriously? And they got worse when Valve realized that half the people were cheating on those achievements, so they made them even MORE tedious. Everything else about the game is pitch perfect though so I forgive it.

I think just their very existence makes them awesome in the way that, if a player *wants* to take on that challenge, they'll do it. If they aren't interested in the challenge, they won't do it.<br/><br/>Tangbile reward? Completion! Or "A mark on my character sheet". No need of permanent die bonus or anything. Maybe one reward is that, in the attempt to hit that achievement ("Social Outmanuvering Of The Local Aristocratic Mayor" in a swashbuckling game), the GM secretly or not-so-secretly lowers the difficulty rating or something.<br/><br/>*All* video game achievements/trophies in games are like that. There is no tangible benefit other than a mark on your Gamer Card somewhere.

Someone else posted a walkthrough of him following the assassins back, then knocking out every single person in the boss' house, dumping every body on the front lawn, then moving every movable item to the front lawn - including furniture and silverware and worthless items, stealing every piece of loot in the house including the purse off his belt and - this is important - <i>leaving the boss conscious and walking around</i> in a house that was now completely empty and stripped to the walls, with all his worldly possessions and followers heaped up in a giant pile.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.lytha.com/thief/lythaway/index.phtml" rel="nofollow">The Lytha Way</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stryck" title="stryck"><img alt="stryck" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stryck">stryck</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189577/#Comment_189577" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T10:55:29+00:00" title="January 22, 2009 10:55AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Achievements are virtual collections.

Bragging rights are, well, about your collection of awesomeness.<br/><br/>WoW, for instance, has a ton of them, but I think the most interesting ones are for defeating the bosses in dungeons a certain way.  Like... The Safety Dance - kill Heiggan without anyone in your party dying.  Ruby/Bronze/Green Void - kill the last boss of the Oculus without using a R/B/G Dragon.  Etc.<br/><br/>They also encourage people to participate in the seasonal festivals by making achievements for uh.. participating, rewarding you with a title (The Hallowed, Merrymaker, etc) that you can display with your name whenever you like.<br/><br/>They have collectors' achievements for pets (50 vanity pets gets you a pet skunk!)  mounts (50 gets you an albino drake!)...<br/><br/>So yeah... they encourage you to explore features and quests that you wouldn't normally do, collect items, participate in events, do things in fun and challenging ways, and more.<br/><br/>I think it would be great stuff in RPGs, and I like the idea of the GM Flags.  I also think that you could have an open list, but just with the clever titles, not knowing what you have to do to complete them until you do it.

Blue has this to say about achievements.</a><br/><br/>As a video game player I have a hard time caring all that much about achievements when I play stuff on my Xbox 360. To some extent, someone's gamerscore is just a measure of how many games they've played, not how good they are, and definitely not of how civil they are. I have to be really goddamn bored with a game for achievements to be the most interesting thing to do in them. (Unlockables are a whole other matter though.)<br/><br/>OTOH, this has me very seriously thinking about putting an achievements system in the Slime Story RPG I'm working on, though of course it's got kind of an MMORPG parody angle to it, making it rather appropriate in a way. I'll have to think about it more.<br/><br/>Just one thing about achievements in tabletop games: IMO they'd need to be relatively easy to track. It's easy for a computer to figure out that you've killed 100 dire rats or whatever, but for a GM to make little tick marks for every one you take down would get kind of tedious. Even with the medals in 3:16 I'm wishing I had a sheet with bubbles to fill in for "missions survived" and whatnot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain" title="Wirebrain"><img alt="Wirebrain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain">Wirebrain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189688/#Comment_189688" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T01:01:45+00:00" title="January 23, 2009  1:01AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>Achievements don't HAVE to have any tangible reward. Simply having the point-to-it-and-grin factor of having an annotated achievement you can point to and grin is frequently reward enough. Most, but not all, Valve achievements are of this type.</blockquote>\nThis Is Important.<br/><br/>Exactly.  I think just their very existence makes them awesome in the way that, if a player *wants* to take on that challenge, they'll do it. If they aren't interested in the challenge, they won't do it.<br/><br/>Tangbile reward? Completion! Or "A mark on my character sheet". No need of permanent die bonus or anything. Maybe one reward is that, in the attempt to hit that achievement ("Social Outmanuvering Of The Local Aristocratic Mayor" in a swashbuckling game), the GM secretly or not-so-secretly lowers the difficulty rating or something.<br/><br/>*All* video game achievements/trophies in games are like that. There is no tangible benefit other than a mark on your Gamer Card somewhere. And likewise, some players obsessively collect them all because that's what they're into, while others only aim for the interesting ones, while yet others simply don't go out of their way to hit any of them.<br/>-Andy<br/><br/>Not true. There have been a few games for the 360 that rewarded the player for earning achievements, such as getting access to character art, new story stuff and behind the scenes items.<br/><br/>The best one that did this was Sci-Fi RPG Mass Effect. While some of the achievements didn't do anything once you earned them, others actually gave the Gamertag (your log-in you use for all your games) bonuses, like access to special equipment for finally earning a million credits, getting to put skills that you mastered into future characters and experience/stat boosts for favoring a party member compared to the others..<br/><br/>I'd see "Achievements/Rewards/Trophies" as something a little more meaningful than "you get it. It doesn't do anything" which is fairly hollow when you take away its standard use - bragging rights. The online nature of these things allows me to look at the achievements of fellow players to see not only what they play but how far/well they are at the title. Without something to define it and give it meaning it at best it becomes a silly joke that took up time which could have been better spent elsewhere, at worst (especially for the "bad" ones) it becomes like those "walls of shame" that a few offices do- posting up marginally bad work that ends up mostly humiliating people and antagonizing them against the management, making employees more apt to second guess their work and nit pick rather than accepting "yeah, you'll make mistakes". What's worse than messing up a scene that screws up the storyline and having to start from scratch? An "award" for doing so in front of your friends who also have to roll up new characters.<br/><br/>No one else would really know about these things so why don't they just do stuff when it doesn't make much sense to give the player new equipment/allies? <br/><br/>Perhaps a character/player could only use one or two of these rewards at a time. and they should be less  "Monster masher - grind 500 kills and you get +50 exp" and more like "Calling Mr. Wolf- you call one person requesting help 5 times when you didn't need to- play this card once per session to get a free analysis of an enemy and mark this card. After three marks, it loses this power."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189770/#Comment_189770" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T12:28:26+00:00" title="January 23, 2009 12:28PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><a href="http://www.lytha.com/thief/lythaway/index.phtml" rel="nofollow">The Lytha Way</a></blockquote>\nHah!

There have been a few games for the 360 that rewarded the player for earning achievements, such as getting access to character art, new story stuff and behind the scenes items.</blockquote>\nWell, video games have had "unlockables" for quite a while now, and they seem to add some replay value (though sometimes it feels artificially so). Achievements on the 360 that are paired with unlockables have thusfar been the exception to the rule, which is kind of weird, really. The implementation of them has been mixed, which seems to be what happens with anything that becomes a standard requirement for video games.<br/><br/>They can serve a useful social purpose if the game in question has enough of a community around it, but I would argue that even for video games it's very easy for them to become irrelevant. No one cares that I got all 200 possible achievement points on Lumines Live, except to note that I play that game too goddamn much (which is true), and no one else I know actually plays it, so those 200 points are a measure of how bored and/or obsessed I can get, but they accomplish nothing at all.<br/><br/>I think that the effects of an achievement in an RPG could be something that is meta-game within reason (on the level of Encounter and Daily powers or Drama Points), or something where the line of cause and effect is clear and sensible (impress the Purple Dragon Knights, and they'll let you join and you "unlock" the Purple Dragon Knight prestige class).<br/><br/>My tentative concept for achievements in Slime Story is that you have a bunch of little cards with achievements on them (and some blank ones for the GM/group to fill in before you play). When you fulfill one of them, the GM hands you the card. You can either use it to get a one-shot bonus power appropriate to the achievement, or trade it in for some XP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189826/#Comment_189826" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T19:21:42+00:00" title="January 23, 2009  7:21PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>Achievements don't HAVE to have any tangible reward.

Achievements offer designers an opportunity to finally start exploring the non-linear nature of the medium without losing the players.<br/></blockquote>\nThis is the most interesting part of that post. So a challenge to all of you that are interested. Come up with a game concept without an inherent reward cycle; where accomplishing something within the game is its own reward and it gives you an "achievement" signifying as such, but there is no in-game kickback for such accomplishments. If you come up with something, you have earned the "I had an Idea" Achievement worth 15 gamerpoints.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189983/#Comment_189983" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T08:37:01+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  8:37AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2009 8:37AM by JDCorley.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's an interesting point, achievements that are somewhat tangential to the thrust of the game introduce a nonlinear aspect to otherwise linear games.

Let me tell you a little bit about how we come up with achievements in the video game industry.<br/><br/>Achievements (gamerscore for Xbox, trophies for PS3) have ended up representing how much of a gamer you are. To get a high gamerscore, you must have played a lot of games. Somebody with a gamerscore of 10,000 has probably spent more time playing than somebody with a gamerscore of 5,000. To that end, the "uninspired" achievements are there so that a player who simply plays through the end of the game gets to walk away with approximately 1/3 to 1/2 of the total points (usually 1000) available in the game. There were some early titles on the 360 that only gave points for unusual behavior, and I found myself frustrated that I had gotten a good ways into the game but "had nothing to show for it," which is ridiculous since Gamerscore is a meaningless number, but then that's human psychology for you.<br/><br/>The rest of the points are divvied up to reward optional challenges, exploration, gameplay milestones, and cool behavior. Oh, and playing all the way through a game definitely counts as cool behavior. If somebody plays my game, but doesn't play long enough to see the stuff I put in the game, I'm a little disappointed. If you didn't finish chapter 10 in Dead Space, I am one sad panda.<br/><br/>We understand the absurd nature of giving a reward for something you would do anyway. Another game I did level design for, The Simpsons Game, has a number of ironic achievements, such as the 5-point achievement called "Pressed Start" that is awarded the first time the player starts a new game.<br/><br/>With all that said, the sorts of things you're talking about here aren't really videogame-style "achievements" because achievements have absolutely no value within the game. However, I really like the idea of achievements as the GM's flags. Lots of games want the GM and other players to talk about their expectations for the game, so it only makes sense to give everybody little goodies to toss each other during play as their desires are met. Also the idea of achievements coming from all players like some sort of pre-loaded fan mail could be cool to explore.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite>Just saying that I still don't get the point... so what... people boast to each other about how good they are at videogames?  this actually happens?  I had no idea.  Do people also boast about how good they are at jerking off?  is this some whole world of masculine bonding activities that I have never been privy to?</blockquote>\nThey're a return of the High Score screen from the arcade machines of yore. And they're not about how good you are, they're about how often you game. Gamers are curious how often other people game. And in my experience, a high score is usually both a source of pride (you worked hard for it) and shame (you need to get out more) in equal measure.<br/><br/>It's the same embarrassing burst of id-joy I feel when my Prius shows me my average efficiency on my current tank of gas is over 55 mpg.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190425/#Comment_190425" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-28T12:20:43+00:00" title="January 28, 2009 12:20PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon_Pettersson</cite><cite>Posted By: Dimfrost</cite>I think you could use achievements as prerequisites for kewl powers, classes etc.</blockquote>\nThat pushes all kinds of buttons for me.

There's two good reasons for these types of achievements.  The first is that it rewards playing the game "normally".  It rewards not just achievement hunters, but people just playing through the game. Second, and more importantly in my mind, it acts as a reminder as flag for the achievement system, engaging people who are used to "just playing" and showing them a different reward system that they can pursue.  I can't tell you* how many times I've gotten an achievement for just playing, which directly prompted me to break from my normal play style of progressing through whatever challenges, to hunting down achievements.  As an addendum, for under achiever achievements, like kill 100 when you end up killing thousands, these are almost always stepping stones to "Kill 1000" and "Kill 10000" and so forth, giving you measurable progress and little rewards if you want to be the guy with the "Kill 1,000,000" achievement.<br/><br/>*Actually, I can try. Every game I've played on the 360, plus the Steam games that have Achievements and World of Warcraft. I usually ignore them, and almost always forget about them, but when that little unlocked reminder pops up, I suddenly start looking how to play the game a whole new way. Since this regularly ebbs and flows, having multiples of these very basic achievements serves as a constant reminder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190460/#Comment_190460" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-28T14:55:32+00:00" title="January 28, 2009  2:55PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that the "mundane" achievements and "bizarre" achievements should be combined.
