You'll also find a bunch of video APs in there, including the first three sessions of a game of <i>Sorcerer</i> I'm currently playing in with Ron, Zac and Jann. There's also some gameplay of <i>Cold Soldier</i> and one of Ron's work-in-progress games, <i>Vigil</i>, a "vigilantes" game.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469183/#Comment_469183" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-22T16:44:34+00:00" title="January 22, 2018  4:44PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469207/#Comment_469207" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-23T10:09:10+00:00" title="January 23, 2018 10:09AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469209/#Comment_469209" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-23T11:32:09+00:00" title="January 23, 2018 11:32AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems to be quite a new business model (or is it?): the paid-subscription web forum!

After all, he is Ron Edwards, his name itself is a draw, and he doesn't post this kind of material in other places.  If you (or your games) want to get his attention, AdeptPlay is probably the best place to do it.<br/><br/>The core of the site is his new Seminar series and Game Consulting (which the consulter may opt to make public or keep private).  But as we developed the site, it grew to include "Actual Play" and the ability for non-Rons to post their own game stuff, in a place where it could be discussed by Ron and his crowd (both Patreon supporters and others), as well as the general RPGing public.<br/><br/>TL/DR: Now that he's set up in his new digs in Sweden, Ron has started a games consulting business, and Adept Play is the internet face of it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469253/#Comment_469253" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-24T17:36:47+00:00" title="January 24, 2018  5:36PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2018 7:22PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Aslf">@Aslf</a><br/>Very cool, Tod!

If you listen to it, I suggest you wear earphones and just use the left earbud. There is background music added to the video and it\u2019s a bit loud and distracting. However, the content is excellent. In particular, Ron is right on point when it comes to the future design space and innovating within it. <br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-cc_lc9J3V4Y?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc_lc9J3V4Y"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/cc_lc9J3V4Y/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><a href="http://adeptplay.com/seminar-hearts-minds/discuss-lesson-pool" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://adeptplay.com/seminar-hearts-minds/discuss-lesson-pool</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469333/#Comment_469333" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-26T16:41:02+00:00" title="January 26, 2018  4:41PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Ron is always interesting to listen to/read.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469408/#Comment_469408" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-29T01:03:52+00:00" title="January 29, 2018  1:03AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I\u2019m watching the video below about RPG design; it uses The Pool to showcase his ideas and observations about RPG design.</p></div></blockquote>Some interesting stuff in there about collaboration vs consensus.

I\u2019ve been thinking about GMless games and talking about how the design space has the most opportunity to grow because their is a lot of room to innovate in that space and that is the space where innovation is most needed. I\u2019ve also been talking about the issues in GMless games, as I see them. This is why Ron\u2019s video spoke to me; I will have to watch  the rest of the video to see what the solutions he proposed are. I think he got the diagnosis of problem right, and the fact that this is the space is ripe for future design right. It will be interesting to see what else he says about the solutions.<br/><br/>I will get back to you once I watch the rest of the video <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469428/#Comment_469428" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-29T21:02:23+00:00" title="January 29, 2018  9:02PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are we watching the same video, Jeff?

Looks like you need to be a paying subscriber to start a new thread, too, and that's probably why (almost?) all threads so far were started by Ron himself (the site's definitely new). Thus, "comment on articles" - while perhaps not the intended model - effectively describes the present state of things.<br/><br/>It says you can make one comment per thread with a free registered account - if you'd like to post multiple comments per thread, that's a privilege you get as a paying subscriber (in addition to the ability to start new threads). I'm not sure how the discussion area nested under each comment figures into this scheme, <a href="/forums/profile/AsIf">@AsIf</a> - does the one-per-thread limit on free accounts refer to first-level comments only, or do these hierarchically inferior questions and answers count toward that limit as well?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469464/#Comment_469464" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-30T16:15:37+00:00" title="January 30, 2018  4:15PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry" rel="nofollow">Peter_Perry</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I'm lost.

He's just developing his game design, same as all of us. Plus, I've only skimmed the thread so far, so I'm not even sure if I understand the question [grin].<br/><br/>For me, the big thing I've learned about design-relevant-to-GMless is the visceral aesthetic communication that he emphasizes in his post-Trollbabe works. The GMlessness is not central to this, really - you look at Trollbabe, it's precisely as concerned about this as say Doctor Xaos is. The way I understand it (and apply it) is that if you don't grok the trollbabe herself as an appealing protagonist figure, then we need to talk some more about the aesthetic antecedents of this game, because she's the key to the whole thing. We get to the same page aesthetically by sharing a mutual appreciation for her.<br/><br/>So I guess that's one sort of formula or technique that is easy to generalize, and has been applied in many games: you take some aesthetic content, text or pictures or whatever, and you lay that down for the gaming group. They are either enthusiastic or not, depending on whether they can relate emotionally to these keystone elements. You need to get everybody on board before continuing further into actual play, either by changing the keystones (e.g. try a different Sorcerer campaign premise, if there's a player who doesn't get your antropomorphic animals idea) or by "opening them" for the other players by further explanation (maybe show them a movie that uses the kind of aesthetics you want).<br/><br/>I did a very intricate form of this technique myself for our on-going wuxia princess play thing this winter. It involved picking out illustrations for all the NPCs and places in the game so as to get the key aesthetic tenets (ultrahigh fantasy, east/west mixture, romantic rather than realist, etc.) communicated concretely, via example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469533/#Comment_469533" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-31T20:35:26+00:00" title="January 31, 2018  8:35PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also remember Ron talking about this approach a lot on the Forge:<br/><br/>The way to get people to cohere around the creative direction of the game is to drape it in very concrete fictional Colour.

No design or mechanics will solve that problem. People have different tastes, cultural references, etc. The more freedom there is for everyone at the table to contribute to the salad, the higher the chance that sometimes stuff will come up from one or more players that someone else at the table will dislike to a certain degree. It's the reason why making movies or books by committee usually is a bad idea.<br/><br/>So imho Ron is right in that quote above, that creative freedom comes at a cost of higher chance for creative dissonance among the creators, and we just have to accept this. The "workshoping way" helps, using pictures, music, film, other cultural refs help, but none will be perfect. Sometimes you'll have a group that has a very clear unified vision, at other times you won't, or anything in between those two extremes.<br/><br/>Personally, this is one of the reasons why I tend to dislike GM-less games. If they are one-shots, or just a couple of sessions, like, say, <b>Fiasco</b>, <b>Zombie Cinema</b>, <b>The Roach</b>, etc, then this is usually not much of a problem, because there isn't an investment in any real prep nor is there a significant time commitment for play, so you don't loose much if for some reason you weren't fully satisfied with the overall experience. For long term play, though, you may have a problem. Also, some people have an higher threshold for this kind of divergent creative input, while others (I confess I'm one of them) will be sensitive to these creative departures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469563/#Comment_469563" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-01T17:20:54+00:00" title="February  1, 2018  5:20PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 1, 2018 5:21PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.

Using the session as an example for a GNS theory question/proposal probably played a role.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry" rel="nofollow">Peter_Perry</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The "workshoping way" helps, using pictures, music, film, other cultural refs help, but none will be perfect.</p></div></blockquote>Makes sense to me!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469594/#Comment_469594" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-02T18:00:03+00:00" title="February  2, 2018  6:00PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2018 6:12PM by DeReel.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry">@Peter_Perry</a> "The more freedom there is for everyone at the table to contribute to the salad, the higher the chance that sometimes stuff will come up from one or more players that someone else at the table will dislike to a certain degree."<br/>Trying to placate your dislike of GM-less games.

The problem can be there in games with a GM, too, and posing the GM as a solution to it means either:<br/>- the GM as the sole provider of artistic vision. What are the other players there for, then? (It is conceivable for one player to dominate the table with their own individual creative vision in a GM-less game too, BTW)<br/>- the GM as the gatekeeper of the shared imagined space, validating every single contribution to it. That's the kind of GM'd game where any other player's contribution to the fiction is only validated when the GM repeats it. Been there, done that, not willing to go there again thanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469612/#Comment_469612" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-03T00:41:35+00:00" title="February  3, 2018 12:41AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2018 12:45AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When the Sorcerer player channels an action movie and tries to jump across rooftops like it's nothing, doesn't the GM have the right and responsibility to decide between, "Sure, no problem" and "That would likely kill you, please don't do that"?\n<ul>\n<li>If so, is that a level of gatekeeping that invalidates other players?

There is no <i>perfect</i> solution to the problem of conflicting visions arising from two or more Players, because that always has a chance of happening (and I am leaving aside cases in which some rule of reality has been miscommunicated or misunderstood), but I find that the best way to handle it when it <i>does</i> happen is similar to the methods of attaining consensus that I learned while I was an OCCUPY facilitator.  It requires breaking the proposal (action, whatever) down into its constituent elements and determining exactly which of those elements are causing the conflict to arise.  Rarely is the entire proposal objectionable outright.<br/><br/>Basically, the GM suggests modifications to the action or description in question which remove or soften <i>only those specific parts of it</i> that cause conflict, while retaining all the rest of it.  In group facilitator parlance this is called "modifying the proposal to remove blocks."  Once the blocks are removed (i.e. those elements of the proposal that caused an issue with someone - perhaps even myself), consensus may again be assumed and the proposal flies.<br/><br/>At the gaming table we have one more tool at our disposal that activist groups don't have: the dice.

          I have my own methods for dealing with such things, and they are quite akin to Tod's "tweak only the conflict-causing parts" and Rafu's "stop the game and talk about it".<br/><br/>I was just trying to see what other methods people might be getting mileage out of.<br/><br/>I got the sense there was a "don't discuss it" approach that might be working, and I thought perhaps "that's the GM's purview" was the answer for <i>how</i> it worked.  But if the Sorcerer GM is supposed to express not just their own tone preferences, but rather the entire group's, then I guess that's not how Sorcerer deals with that issue.<br/><br/>Are we using real world logic, or action movie logic?  Sorcerer's resolution rules don't answer that.  (Maybe no games do?)  If rooftop jumping doesn't work for you as an example, then let's say jumping into a window off an exploding motorcycle, or something else that happens only in movies.  <br/><br/>Before we can roll any dice, I suspect that we need to know the basic realm of possibility that we're navigating.  So, how does that possibility space get established?<br/><br/>I'm used to establishing it initially in pre-game chats.  But I'm sure my way isn't the only way...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469627/#Comment_469627" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-03T21:36:44+00:00" title="February  3, 2018  9:36PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2018 9:38PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [deleted tangent]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469628/#Comment_469628" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-03T22:31:22+00:00" title="February  3, 2018 10:31PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2018 10:34PM by AsIf.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Listening to Ron running <i>Sorcerer</i>, I notice he does a lot of tentative floating when things get stuck, like thinking for a few seconds and then saying something like "Oh!  You know what might be cool?"  He tends to be speaking to a particular person when he says stuff like this.  The Player often goes along with the thing he suggests, or else they put their own spin on it, which Ron almost always immediately accepts, or another Player pipes up and builds upon it.  In this way Ron is providing a "seed" idea and then allowing the Players to run with it together, needing little or no verbal nudging from him after that point.<br/><br/>Since this all happens verbally in real-time, and since people on the whole want to be nice (and since some of them have internalized the Yes And rule), additional details, spin-offs and even replacement suggestions tend to be accepted by the other Players in what I can only call a self-governing system based on unconscious social notions of altruism, fair play and reciprocity.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469629/#Comment_469629" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-04T00:12:32+00:00" title="February  4, 2018 12:12AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Peter_Perry">@Peter_Perry</a> You never said "doomed to fail" it is true.

I'm a big fan of, "You know what might be cool?" too.<br/><br/>To connect that to getting on the same page, I think "You know what might be cool?" is often the best follow-up in Archipelago after "try another way".  If you're going to use "try another way" to nix someone's contribution, then it's nice to avoid leaving them potentially stranded.<br/><br/>"Try another way" is certainly an efficient way to address total clash, by giving veto power to whomever's vision gets violated.  Personally, I prefer this more as an adjunct to initial agreement rather than a replacement for it, but I can imagine groups using it to agree by invoking it a bunch in the early going.  Maybe kinda like how you can establish whatever "about play" prescriptions you want in Universalis by paying for them.  I recall that being effective (though much slower than just an informal chat).<br/><br/>Hey <a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a>, is "You know what might be cool?" on your list of GM/play techniques?  There's also the similar, "Here's one option you could try," for stalling out in a different play context.  And then also the Archipelago key phrases, "try another way", "show me more detail", etc.?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469646/#Comment_469646" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-05T14:09:15+00:00" title="February  5, 2018  2:09PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I included several that included the same concept, and yest, most of this exploration in techniques started with Archipielago, Though It would be better to insert the exact keyphrases, since they have become more usual with the community.
