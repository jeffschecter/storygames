So, when an Insomniac goes into the Mad City to fix his life or by accident, there's always the possibility that something goes on in the City Slumbering they cannot act against.<br/><br/>Of course, there's nothing to say against the Mad City being a mirror-nightmare of the City Slumbering, and handling it totally different. <br/><br/>In my game, the Insomniacs usually go through a door to find themselves in the other city. But then again, it can happen by turning around a corner, jumping around a window, going to the restroom\u2026                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123993/#Comment_123993" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-02T16:43:29+00:00" title="February  2, 2008  4:43PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This isn't advice per se, but if you love Silent Hill as much as I do, having City Slumbering turn into Mad City abruptly around the players sounds fucking awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/despair" title="despair"><img alt="despair" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/despair">despair</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123995/#Comment_123995" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-02T16:51:11+00:00" title="February  2, 2008  4:51PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that having the worlds overlap is pretty creepy.

At GenCon, I ran two separate two-hour games, including the time it took to explain the premise of the game &amp; do char-gen.  But that was for four people -- and I really don't like running for more than that nowadays.  I love doing two-hour games, and would like to promote a track of those at some point for folks who can't fit a four-hour game into their schedule.<br/><br/>Good luck with your 10 hour game!  Personally, I'd be wary of that, if only because I don't know anyone who would commit to one game that long at a con, but if you can rock it, go for it.  Incidentally, what are you planning on doing that requires 10 hours to see through?  It sounds like, based on your other comment, there isn't much of a plan beyond doing full character generation (which I also do in every DRYH game I run at cons) and seeing what might take up the rest of those 10 hours.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_124058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124058/#Comment_124058" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-03T04:02:41+00:00" title="February  3, 2008  4:02AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>Good luck with your 10 hour game!
