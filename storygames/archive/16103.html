Sometimes, though, a hardholder or scavenger brood makes a pact\u2014with the blasted heath, with the poisoned ground, with the Psychic Maelstrom itself\u2014and the pact is this: OBEY THE LAW AND YOU WILL SURVIVE.<br/><br/>And so a haven is created amidst all the want and suffering, a hardhold of sorts but something more, something almost civilized. Children are born and raised within its limits, taught to fear the world beyond and to obey the law, taught the means of survival. Generations go by, and yet the people remain.<br/><br/>But humanity is curious and heedless; they do not obey the law but break it\u2014in part or in full\u2014every day. And thus every day the broken world chips away at this mote of security and stability, awaiting the day when it will be consumed in desperation and darkness.<br/><br/>The ones known as the Angel, the Battlebabe, and so on... maybe they were born and raised in a place such as this, a place long ago and far away, a place without the constant fear of death and want, a place long since consumed. If so, these are the stories they tell no one, the stories of what they used to be before the broken world made them hard, cool, hot, and weird, the stories of growing up.<br/><br/><b>Bibliography: Thanks for These Dark Dreams</b><br/><br/>- The White Mountains (1967) by John Christopher<br/>- Clay\u2019s Ark (1984) by Octavia E.

It doesn't seem like much of an "advance" to give a char a new move that they had to roll+0. How often in AW does a player pick a new move for which they have a +0 stat? Generally, it seems like they need to have a +1 or it's not going to seem "worth it," even if it opens up new possibilities in play.  Still, if you want adult stats to start at +0, try it out and let me know how it goes! That's definitely a valid hack to make and I can see a lot of arguments for it.  After all, the youth basic moves are complete as they are, so you only need to use the adult moves in dire situations when you want to do something otherwise impossible (like Read a Person!). It might slow down advancement too, if you want a longer-term youth game. Currently it's written with the youth on the cusp of becoming adults.<br/><br/>Thanks for the recommendation, Rob.  Getting new reading recommendations is one of the best side effects of this hack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367225/#Comment_367225" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T13:17:50+00:00" title="March 13, 2012  1:17PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.S.

Several of the new additions worked well, like cutting the youth to two starting stats (Sharp and Strong) and the new Hx/Status guidelines that I stole partially from Joe/Monsterhearts. The new "take XP when you are distressed" move is fun but needs a little bit more polishing, since we were hitting it all the time in proper emo fashion.  The main thing that I realized is needed is a way for the adults to be intrusive and demanding. This sessions was all about the kids, which was cool, but didn't really feel enough like YA fiction in that way, where the difference between youth and adults is in pretty stark contrast. The adults should definitely be a threat, maybe a couple of different kinds of threats, and I may need some stronger MC language about how to continually insert them into play. Currently, it's too easy for the PCs to just hang out with other kids and avoid the adults, unless the MC is really playing them hard.<br/><br/>So: players were great, moves were mostly great, characters and setting were great, the new Triune Law was better but still didn't have enough teeth because the lack of adults present. We're getting close to "done" with The Afterborn, but there's still a bit more polishing needed. Also, I did this weird intuitive thing, where I made two of the three required threats (currently starts one each for homefront, the outside world, and one that crosses boundaries) be adults and didn't make hard enough threats or dangers for the outside world, despite us coming up with all this cool stuff about poisonous spores and jungle dangers and other colonies that we didn't trust or understand. That pointed me in the direction of strengethening the adult role, though it didn't quite happen in practice, but made the world less scary, I think.<br/><br/>That said, the session was fun and the players really brought it.  They lived in an underground military bunker with their families, as the surface world had been taken over by a lush tropical jungle environment filled with poisonous and deadly things that would kill them.  I thought back to that bio-tech thread a while back about Nausicaa and that Japanese comic Andy (?) posted where people were being killed by weird spores and plant things. There were some awkward teen romance moments. The Council of Peers told Jackson's female PC that they were happy she thought she'd found love with Lesley's female PC, but were hesitiant to approve another "non-procreating pairing."  Ouch! Part of the Triune Law was that they had to approve all relationships in advance, which of course led to a bunch of illicit love. Lukas' PC also discovered the hidden subbasement of the complex -- Resident Evil style -- where he discovered a corpse with monstrous plant tendrils that grew out <i>from the inside</i>. After that, he took some Weird with an advance and was heading in a Brainer direction. And Andi's PC kept having this back-and-forth with her would-be illegal boyfriend, especially when they were forced to clean the roof cisterns together. The game ended with Lesley's PC finding some forbidden ancient maps that showed other secret complexes in the area, related to but unconnected to Harrow, the base they lived in.  Oh, and also saving Jackon's PC from getting poisoned in a... creative fashion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
