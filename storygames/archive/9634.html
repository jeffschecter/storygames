Group consensus seems to be that the atmosphere of the blue is stacked: heavier gases below lighter gases. A well designed ship can 'float' at roughly the level of the habitable zone. The atmosphere gets too thin higher up and toxic lower down. Ships, especially pirates, will dive into the lower levels, but they have to be designed for such a purpose. Oh, and you need gas masks.<br><br>The physics around the 'rocks' and the 'sun' are a bit more vague: the 'sun' definitely exerts a pull on everything else, but it stays at the same altitude. The rocks can move: the most populated ones are pretty much known/expected to be stable, but some of the others float down and up, sometimes on a regular schedule, almost like a comet.<br/><br/>Some of those rocks appear to have evidence of older societies. The Crimson Sky game featured the Judges. Apparently in (our) the Blue law is kind of an artifact of an older civilization: the Judges are stone statues that perfectly apply the law. Of course these things aren't made any more, so finding a new judge on one of the rocks is a major event. If we ever return to the Blue using the Revolucion rules again (like we did for the Crimson Sky game), I think we'll kick things off with the discovery of an unusual judge.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/salvagebar" title="salvagebar"><img alt="salvagebar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/salvagebar">salvagebar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214109/#Comment_214109" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-23T17:21:39+00:00" title="June 23, 2009  5:21PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2009 11:28PM by salvagebar.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's talk about zeppelins, which are properly lighter-than-air craft in which the envelope of buoyant gas is contained within a complete, rigid frame (as opposed to a semi-rigid craft, which may have one or two ring-shaped frames, or a blimp, which has no frame at all). Some advantages of the zeppelin:<br/><br/>The buoyancy of the gas does most of the work of moving the total weight, and typical airships between the wars had operating ranges of 8,000 to 10,000 miles. <br/>The frame, by forcing the gas envelope into an aerodynamic shape, allowed cruising speeds of about 50-60mph, and top speeds of 80mph or more were possible, much faster than sea-going ships.<br/>In a blimp or balloon, gravity pulls the cockpit to a point directly underneath the gas envelope. With a rigid frame, so long as you balance the weight on each side of the craft, you have freedom to place observation decks, engines, weaponry, and instruments anywhere you please.<br/>Line of sight far exceeds any sea- or land-going craft.<br/>They can carry small fighter craft, and you have quite a lot of internal space to work with.<br/>They make much more stable weapons platforms than any fixed wing aircraft, and are comparable to battleships in this way.<br/><br/>One surprising strength was that, once the gas envelope was divided into dozens of separate chambers, the buoyancy of the zeppelins could not be affected except by a hellish storm of ordinary anti-aircraft and cannon fire. Piercing the bottoms of the gas chambers did very little, since the buoyant gas was literally pushing against the top, and because of the flexibility of the envelope material, it was hard for even the largest cannons to make significant holes, especially with a trained crew moving throughout the superstructure, patching holes as they were made. It was common for airships to be raked bow to stern by fighter planes. If you imagine filling a giant balloon with water, and then trying to empty it by pricking it with a needle, you start to get the idea.<br/><br/>However, <i>holy shit do they explode spectacularly.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/salvagebar" title="salvagebar"><img alt="salvagebar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/salvagebar">salvagebar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214113/#Comment_214113" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-23T18:01:53+00:00" title="June 23, 2009  6:01PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2009 11:18PM by salvagebar.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            part two -<br/><br/>Hydrogen, the most buoyant gas known, is one of the most explosive. A lightning strike almost always caused total destruction. Of the four lighter-than-air (LTA) craft that the United States operated between the wars, three were lost to storms. In several cases, serious damage was done by fires caused by man-made sparks released when crewmembers developed static charges, and airmen had to be equipped with special shoes to prevent this. The development of tracer ammunition, regular aircraft cannon rounds coated with flammable chemicals, nearly spelled the doom of LTA transport as we know it.<br/><br/>Three advances developed by Hughes Aircraft Company and Graf von Zeppelin, LLC allowed airships to continue to perform as viable, and ultimately superior, craft for war and merchant use.<br/><br/>Hydro-Nite, a blend of the LTA gases hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, and neon, was extremely successful in suppressing the explosive potential of pure hydrogen.<br/><br/>High altitude modifications were developed that allowed engines to maintain high pressures within combustion chambers, increasing the operating ceiling of LTA craft to a maximum of about 40,000 feet. This gave airships access to the jet streams, allowing speeds across long distances that had been limited to fixed-wing aircraft.<br/><br/>A gas bypass system was developed that funneled the exhaust gases of airship diesel engines into the spaces between the gas envelope chambers. These gases were quite hot, and buoyant in themselves (like carbon monoxide), and heated the outer envelopes of airships, retarding the formation of ice. Ice added weight which made prolonged operation at high altitudes impossible without terrible loss of fuel economy.<br/><br/><i>For "Lady Blackbird" purposes, you can introduce supernatural methods of manufacture, which could be applied at any part of the process which you think is cool.<br/>Sorry for the scholarly, dry style of the writing - Judd's answer was better. </i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214117/#Comment_214117" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-23T18:56:13+00:00" title="June 23, 2009  6:56PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's cool about Judd's explanation is that it suggests a critical component to resonance engines is the heavy iron bar required to focus the magnetic resonance.  My working name for it is the <i>star axis</i>.  When charged, the star axis governs buoyancy, or vertical position relative to the star.  Each planet or asteroid has its own fixed resonance that gives it a particular buoyancy, which in turn translates to a static orbital course.  The plane of the star's equator is zero degrees buoyancy, of course.<br/><br/>Airships can alter their buoyancy to positive or negative, which causes lift or drop.  Matching buoyancy to another object means going to relative zero buoyancy or zero-B.  Turbines or sails or mechanical wings or other methods of propulsion provide lateral velocity.  Airfoils assist with maneuverability.  Skilled engineers can use the star axis to push or pull relative to the star, as Judd mentioned, thereby delivering a certain amount of lateral thrust to the vessel, which provides extra turning velocity in larger vessels, depending on the number of star axes and their placement.<br/><br/>An interesting fact is that some asteroids have flux iron in their cores, giving them variable buoyancy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214135/#Comment_214135" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-23T22:23:06+00:00" title="June 23, 2009 10:23PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Love.<br/><br/>You get somebody in love at the back of your ship, and the person they're in love with at the front of your ship.
