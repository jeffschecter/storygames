Essentially, the rules seem like a great framework for throwing the players into dangerous and complex situations, and having them figure out the best ways through them.<br/><br/>Thing is, the rules don't talk about what philosophies of dice rolling to consider. You can either have a more 'indie game' approach to rolling like The Burning Wheel where each roll answers a question and you keep moving forward with the results without time spent re-rolling. OR a more retro game approach where time is an extremely important factor. Sure, you can spend all day trying to unlock the door, but your lantern only has an hour of oil left and you're a hundred feet underground and you're going to want to see things when you try to get out.<br/><br/>The game could even support both at different times, but there needs to be a lot of talk about when to roll. There's even some pretty decent discussion of this in other parts of the guidelines.<br/><br/>Reminds me, I've been thinking a lot about how I'd right the D&amp;D 5 DM advice section if I worked for WotC. I should probably do that at some point...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387086/#Comment_387086" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-14T12:52:18+00:00" title="August 14, 2012 12:52PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Well, the thing is it has the problem that most D&amp;D editions, including Pathfinder (especially Pathfinder) have.</blockquote>\nWhich problem is that?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387094/#Comment_387094" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-14T13:55:05+00:00" title="August 14, 2012  1:55PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem that they want to explain how to play all games people think D&amp;D.

The DC idea is still the same as both 4e and 3e. Any differences between the 3e, 4e and 5e are really very subtle.<br/><br/>If anything, it's lost some of the easy play power of 4e, but it doesn't seem to be any more or less customizeable than it's always been. I'm sorry, I just feel like months of watching people argue has just produced a product which isn't any different. I guess that's why D&amp;D's always been a winning equation in the gaming industry, eh?<br/><br/>On the upside, I don't see feats. That's promising. Specialties look like kind of a combination of Feats and Class Powers maybe? That's not a bad idea.

The designers realized adding all the situational bonus and penalties was annoying, so came up with advantages and disadvantages (Next) instead of going further and cutting almost all of them (Apocalypse World / Dungeon World). The designers realized that too rapid escalation by level was making it wonky so slowed it down (Next) instead of cutting it entirely (AW / DW). Mike and the others are good designers, but they are trapped from truly innovating by the history of the product. It may well become the best version of D&amp;D so far and I hope it succeeds, but unfortunately on the basis of what I've seen so far that won't be enough for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387130/#Comment_387130" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-14T22:25:07+00:00" title="August 14, 2012 10:25PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2012 10:33PM by Teataine.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think when you say "it's bland", "it's like 3e and 4e", "it's not out ahead like 4e" and "it's just D&amp;D" you're exactly confirming that they're hitting their design goals. <br/><br/>I like 4e a lot, but it was exactly its boldness that made it a commercial failure vis a vis PF.

But yeah, if we're talking about "what is this game for" then it doesn't have a clear focus.<br/>It's design is primarily social. Create a platform for the brand that most people can agree "this is D&amp;D". No matter how well designed 4e was, it sadly didn't qualify for a lot of people.<br/>Its design is also mechanical on an abstract level.  As someone who got into roleplaying with 3e (and had a love-hate relationship with it for a long time) I feel that they are fixing a lot of the problems from that edition (mostly by applying 4e solutions in an unintrusive manner).<br/><br/>If there is a platonic D&amp;D and we ask what is it about the answer is "strategic and careful management of resources, tactical wargamey combat and invention and wonderment"*. Next seems to cover at least two of those without any real commitment. It's not focused but it's functional for _playing D&amp;D_. Whether that will pay off remains to be seen.<br/><br/>I must admit I am not without bias here. My regular group won't play 4E, and the retroclones feel to archaic or limited to them. I on the other hand like most editions of D&amp;D for various reasons. If Next can give me something with 3e-style customization for my players but with an advancement system that actually functions and elegant solutions and tools in the 4e vein with a simple core like Basic/AD&amp;D for a quicker and dirtier game, this will be the D&amp;D for me. So I'm at least a little invested.<br/><br/><br/>*there's also the "telling heroic stories" angle in the dragonlance tradition but I feel by now that is considered an evolutionary offshot of D&amp;D                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387147/#Comment_387147" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-15T04:49:55+00:00" title="August 15, 2012  4:49AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think your investment will be pretty safe; it will deliver similar stuff to before somewhat better along the lines you want and lots of people will play it so it should fit your need.<br/><br/>Whether it will be the commercial success Hasbro wants / demands and most importantly (to me) the D&amp;D game I want to play are different questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387160/#Comment_387160" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-15T08:26:03+00:00" title="August 15, 2012  8:26AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If there is a platonic D&amp;D and we ask what is it about the answer is "strategic and careful management of resources, tactical wargamey combat and invention and wonderment."</blockquote>\nSee, I'm not interested in any of those, necessarily. What I want from D&amp;D is the feeling of going on a dangerous fantasy adventure. The rest of the details don't matter. I don't care in any particular fashion how the game achieves that (and there are hundreds of possible ways), but this doesn't do it for me. The resource management doesn't feel desparate and exciting, just boring and clunky. Combat doesn't feel risky and death-defying, it seems ponderous and repetitive. And there's no sense of purpose or vision expressed. I don't know what we're doing or why we're doing it. They've made it as generic as possible, which is missing the lessons of video games like World of Warcraft, Dragon Age, Skyrim, etc. that have made fantasy such a known and populare genre these days. There's no unique flavor or reason to engage with it.

OD&amp;D was basically a board game where you went into a dungeon and most of you died horribly. The one guy who makes it out alive is the hero, not the schmucks who went in. It was a resource management survival horror game. THAT'S why all the OSR games lately have been feeling flat to me... because that's the design philosophy I want to see emulated, and no one (even my beloved Dungeon World) has managed to really drive home. <br/><br/>With a bit of tweaking I could play that style of game with this D&amp;D. The PCs are squishy again, at least at the low levels. Plus the characters are more plug and play, so less fiddling with character rules like in 3rd ed (The final release of D&amp;D Next will probably be complicated again, but the playtest doc is pretty much up my ally).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387169/#Comment_387169" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-15T09:05:30+00:00" title="August 15, 2012  9:05AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BReenekamp, I'd say there's no such as an "edition" that brought out such flavor, only GMs and groups that brought out the flavor they wanted from the game they played. Every player, even in the same group, has different expectations from the same game and blames the game when they don't get it. If the designers make a game thinking in every possible situation that may arise and prepare rules for everything, you get a game too complicate to be played without a rules-lawyer. If the designers don't put enough good advice to help the GM come up with something when there aren't rules for an specific situation, then the game only works with experienced GMs. And on the other side, not enough content and the players will feel the game has no substance.<br/><br/>So rules are light (which is good for me, I have never been able to memorize enough 3.5 rules to GM it comfortably), and I'm hoping they do it better with the setting. And if they don't, I'll just grab and old setting or write my own. But I'll definitely won't buy a D&amp;D next corebook, I'll just borrow it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387173/#Comment_387173" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-15T09:23:44+00:00" title="August 15, 2012  9:23AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I can't help but think it's also a huge opportunity for more interesting dungeon-y games to keep seizing more of the market.</blockquote>\nI'm getting the same vibe.

I really liked the flavor of the warlock pacts in 4E (infernal, starlight, fae). They implied a lot about the setting and tone without being this really long and elaborate descriptions. Plus, seems like everybody loved the addition of the Raven Queen; she was really badass. I don't think 4E as a whole was successful in providing a really compelling vision of what play was about, but there were little interesting tidbits here and there that showed what could have been possible, if they had been strengthened and placed at the core instead of the periphery.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387186/#Comment_387186" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-15T10:43:44+00:00" title="August 15, 2012 10:43AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well it's kinda too soon to compare what is essentially a playtest document containing the most generic and malleable classes in fantasy with the setting info and flavor of a more specific class contained in a fully published game...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387191/#Comment_387191" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-15T10:55:02+00:00" title="August 15, 2012 10:55AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And even then, the Backgrounds are great!

I don't see a reward system there.<br/><br/>I think the reward for playing D&amp;D is to explore deeper into the world.  The dungeon - full of mysterious, dangerous, and exciting possibilities lies before you.  You play (smart/to character/to your build) and gain levels.  Once you do that, you open up more mysterious, dangerous, and exciting possibilities to explore.<br/><br/>I don't see how the playtest documents do this.  Creating more mysterious, more dangerous, and more exciting situations should be what happens when you play.  How you can access those features is the reward system.  There's no mention of that in the playtest documents.<br/><br/>It seems like we're testing the basic resolution mechanics without a reward system.  I don't see how the basic resolution mechanics feed into a reward system.<br/><br/>I posted this on EN World:<br/><br/>I don't understand what the skill system is supposed to be doing.<br/><br/>Is it only for PCs and NPCs who are in conflict with PCs? That seems to make sense, since any average human/demi-human can accomplish a task that only "especially talented individuals need even try their hand at" as long as they take twenty times as long. However they don't come out and say that anywhere.<br/><br/>Contests and Saving Throws still overlap.<br/><br/>I don't see why they have a list of DCs if they tell you to ignore them and go with your gut.<br/><br/>I think it's funny that they don't want description for combat.<br/><br/>I think they need to explain why you would want to ignore the dice and why you wouldn't, instead of the vague "use your style" advice.<br/><br/>*<br/><br/>It all seems muddled. Maybe that's the point - they want the rules to be unclear, so that everyone runs the game differently because they have to fill in the blanks.

Otherwise, the phases proceed in ascending order. Spellcasters must focus the entire round for their spells to go off in the 7th phase and tanks can protect their spellcasters earlier in the round by getting in the way of attacks made against them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387285/#Comment_387285" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-16T11:14:13+00:00" title="August 16, 2012 11:14AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2012 11:15AM by Jacob.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My impressions are negative.

There is also a blurb about gaining XP for non combat encounters, but emphasizes there MUST be a chance of failure for it to be worth XP. <br/><br/>So the driving focus of the game is "seek out danger, and overcome it".<br/><br/>I personally prefer the old GP = XP method, but that is driven by my ideal that D&amp;D is about greedy treasure hunters, not brave heroes.<br/><br/>I'm hoping the final rules will have different reward systems; XP for loot, XP for combat, XP for story, etc. Pick one or more to drive the focus of your game.\n<blockquote>It all seems muddled.

This is just the core mechanics; I'm thinking there will be a Combat Options book, a Narration &amp; Story Options book, a Expanded Skill Options book, etc. Plug and play rules, so different gamers are all familiar with the base game syntax, but different campaigns will use specialized subsystems (that people are at least familiar with).<br/><br/><br/>[edit, my quotes came out weird. quoting Dave L above]<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387287/#Comment_387287" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-16T11:24:06+00:00" title="August 16, 2012 11:24AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2012 11:24AM by johnzo.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            yeah, that Old School Hack initiative system is pretty clever with its one-step intent declaration and sequencing.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387297/#Comment_387297" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-16T15:10:23+00:00" title="August 16, 2012  3:10PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4pod/20120806" rel="nofollow">Part One</a> of the D&amp;D Next podcast with Penny Arcade is light on content, but <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4pod/20120813" rel="nofollow">Part Two</a> gets down to some cool elements in character creation.

I hope it is.<br/><br/>In other news, Warlock and Sorcerer will be available in a day or two to show how you can have non-vancian casters in the game. Also a new playtest adventure if I understood correctly.<br/><br/>You know, two years is a very long time. It will be so weird to see this unfold.<br/><br/>And finally, even if it doesn't concern 5E - they will be releasing their back catalogue (including TSR stuff, presumably) in digital format.

Realizing they've given next-to-no information on how to design or build or whatever you do with it a "next" adventure, I suddenly feel adrift in an ocean of strange mixed-edition D&amp;D. I'm directionless. Don't know how to put it together at all. Does this have something to do with how long its been since I played D&amp;D? I mean, this game was my introduction to the hobby, but now what is it? It's not 3E Rules-For-Everything at all. It's not 4E Rules-For-Only-What-We-Want-You-To-Do either.<br/><br/>It's bizarre. Bizarre and strangely liberating.<br/><br/>As for the rules, whatever they say, the rules they hand us still matter. I like that we can cross-match skills and stats now. They're separate fiddly bits we can combine however we want.<br/><br/>I've got a question as well: People like to throw around that D&amp;D is an Oral Tradition. Not that many people really learn it from the book, and haven't for a long time. There's almost always someone who has played before. They're bringing previous D&amp;D baggage with them. Is this whole "fill in the blanks" or "play it how you want" thing that folks are observing in this thread simply the designers capitalizing on that trend? <br/><br/>"If people are already playing however they want, let's design something they can pour their expectations into, and what comes out will be the game they want to be playing anyways."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387343/#Comment_387343" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-17T11:52:19+00:00" title="August 17, 2012 11:52AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: warlock and sorcerer, just re-download the playtest packet from the WotC site.

I dislike the fact that the GM now has (at least) two non-orthogonal ways to influence the difficulty of a roll: give an advantage/disadvantage die or modify the DC.  It's not obvious when to use each and what the effect is on success chance.  It also feels that "roll two dice and take the best/worst" was tacked-onto an already solid a well-understood die mechanic because it would make Next cooler, like all those clever indie games...<br/><br/>I agree that the characters are much more fun (to make). The backgrounds make your character feel more real even if you can't muster much imagination when creating one.<br/><br/>I'm concerned that between the first play-test drop and the second (which was, what, a handful of weeks apart?) so much got changed.  Not minor stuff either: HPs for PCs and monsters got pretty much halved, weapon damage did a little dance and went from higher-than-3.5 back to pretty-much-the-same-as-3.5.  These sorts of changes seems highly reactive and don't make me think that Wizards have a clear intention with the game.<br/><br/>In short, I'm finding myself a bit uninterested.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387355/#Comment_387355" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-17T15:04:33+00:00" title="August 17, 2012  3:04PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I echo an earlier statement by someone here that this is probably the first time I've not been planning on buying all the D&amp;D core books for a new edition... which kind of sucks because I own every core book that's been released since I was old enough to read.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387356/#Comment_387356" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-17T15:17:59+00:00" title="August 17, 2012  3:17PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding DCs and advantages, I think it's pretty clear.

Backgrounds and Specialties are cool, especially how backgrounds have fictional hooks like people coming to ask for stuff, or always knowing to go for certain types of information.  I like the efforts to make the classes really distinct.  The fighter expertise dice looks promising.  (Although 4E looked really promising to me, and I didn't do what I expected.)<br/><br/>What's interesting about the text so far is some sections give good advice, but if you come at them with a different perspective I think you'd read them to mean something different entirely.  E.g. the Ignoring the Dice section tells you not to roll if the result is clear.  But especially with the example it gives I think a lot of people will interpret it as telling the DM to ignore die rolls he doesn't like.\n<blockquote>Carrying capacity should be excised from D&amp;D rules forever unless it's weighted in coins or a LotFP-style point system.<br/><br/>Anyway I'm quite liking next so far. I have a few issues but it seems they plan on fixing those later down the road. <br/><br/>The only thing that bothers me a lot is the awful advice about setting a DC after the player rolls...ugh.</blockquote>\nReading through the playtest docs, while this is what it says, I don't think it's what they mean.  It talks about basing success and failure on only the d20 that they roll.  In other words, they really mean make the DC depend on what you want their chances of success to be, not how hard it is.  This is also lame (stuff gets harder as you get better, so you don't really improve), but a different issue.\n<blockquote><blockquote>The parts of Next that really make my skin crawl are the ones that reinforce the idea that the GM has a specific story to tell and here's how you coerce the players into telling it.</blockquote>\nAnd a huge chunk of their audience thinks that's what roleplaying is all about.

But the basic mechanic seems fine to me.<br/><br/>I really really want to make "consult the fiction" t-shirts to give out at cons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387436/#Comment_387436" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-18T19:32:29+00:00" title="August 18, 2012  7:32PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2012 8:33PM by Irminsul.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't see why setting DCs in 3.x D&amp;D is any different than setting Obs in Burning Wheel or Mouse Guard.</blockquote>\nAll the setting difficulty talk reminds me of this <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/205678#Comment_205678" rel="nofollow">great John Harper post</a>.<br/><br/>EDIT: I'm not quoting you Deliverator for any reason other than you were the last to comment on this topic -- I'm not "calling you out" or anything!

If a GM abuses that to railroad, that's not the game's problem, no more than an MC pre-determining outcomes is a problem of Apocalypse World. <br/><br/>In fact, one of the reasons why I feel in love with AW so quickly was because it promoted a fiction-first kind of play that I was familiar with from <i>good</i> D&amp;D gaming (not all D&amp;D gaming by a long stretch).<br/><br/>If the DM says there's a wooden door, then it's DC 17 to break down. Consult the fiction. If you say there's a wooden door, but it's suddenly DC 23 because you don't want the players to go that way, that's bullshit and you should have your DM card revoked. If you put an reinforced adamantium door there instead, then the players will teleport, lockpick or burrow their way through or just go elsewhere. If you have intention to railroad and collapse the passage with an avalanche or whatever, then you will railroad anyway, DCs or no.<br/><br/>That's why that sidebar in the latest doc is such absurd nonsense. They know better. But I guess Next is also build on pandering to certain demographics and one of them is the partecipationist, "we didn't even roll dice" crowd. And you know, that's fine, they can still build a good, fun, functional game behind that - those people will ignore the mechanics anyway. The important part is the presentation of such "advice" particularly for new gamers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On Dis/Advantage: as a DM you don't really modify DCs anymore (no -2/+2 type modifiers like in 3e) you set a DC based on the fiction. And it shouldn't be your job to adjucate _vantage all the time either. The official stance (expressed in design diaries, not sure it's in the playtest docs yet) is that _vantage is only gained through player (or monster) action. Ie. the PC gets advantage when they use a spell, stunt, ability, power or other action that grants one. Maybe you can give _vantage as a freebie once in a blue moon, but it shouldn't be the rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L" title="Dave L"><img alt="Dave L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20L">Dave L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388001/#Comment_388001" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T00:57:32+00:00" title="August 24, 2012 12:57AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Reward system: "Every monster has its own XP value, specified with the rest of its statistics."

The driving focus of the game might be something like "seek out monsters and show how you defeat them."

I find even Dungeon World's xp system dodgy.<br/><br/>*I know this because anecdotal evidence and rumors.<br/><br/>I know that if Next turns out something I will run, I'll be giving out xp for gold recovered or spent.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>I ran a two hour game a couple of days ago, my first actual playtest of Next. Two friends made a Rogue and a Wizard. The Rogue got shafted by the reintroduction of attacks of opportunity I think, they can't weave in and out of combat anymore as it was implied they could in the first packet. The skills are kinda messed up. I liked their original concepts and ideas for them but now they went in too deep trying to solve problems that are created by the skill system in the first place. I think that if they don't untangle this I will be running games without Backgrounds. They fought a bunch of skeletons and died twice (the first time they recovered and woke as the necromancer's prisoners, the second time we wrapped up the session because it was late).<br/><br/>Overall the game feels a lot more Howard and a lot more Vance that the last two installments, which in my eyes is a success. Although to be honest, like I commented on ENworld it's more a matter of the system not obstructing such play/flavour rather than actively enforcing it.<br/><br/>I think it's 3rd edition with 12 years of hindsight. The actual 3rd edition was a bloody mess. This takes AD&amp;D/2E as a jump off point and builds a sequel with 4E's attention to math and streamlined, easy handling. It's also 4E for people who didn't like the actual 4E (meaning it has most of the trappings and innovations of 4E, just presented in a different way - I've always claimed that 4E's main problem was presentation).<br/><br/>If they keep improving and fixing and expanding this, I will:<br/>-play it rather than 4e because combat doesn't last hours and it's far easier to keep track of, it makes my players happier with the diversity of classes and it feels it's more like about adventurers than fantasy superheroes (and I personally prefer the former)<br/>-play it rather than 3E/PF because combat doesn't last hours, the math is flatter and not all-around fucked, casters aren't dominating melee classes, magic items are not assumed, alignment is largely divorced from mechanics, skill points are gone, and I could keep going for hours<br/>-play it rather than AD&amp;D because it's has the same kind of simplicity and speed without being a glorious mess of confusing subsystems<br/>-play it rather than Basic/retroclones because it has the same kind of ease to it but with far more classes, races and levels<br/><br/>If they mess it up, it's not like there's a shortage of other options and games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonB" title="JonB"><img alt="JonB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonB">JonB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388049/#Comment_388049" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T07:45:27+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  7:45AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ran a game last Sunday. Very satisfied with speed of play for it, and I think Teataine makes a very good point about how the game plays not like 3E/PF. <br/><br/>I think, if they continue with the (explicit or unknown to them, not sure) design philosophy of "Every character must be really easy to play, while still remaining unique and interesting," then we'll end up with a game that's very pleasing, fast, and simple. One of the benchmarks of this, for me, was that I never had to ask a player what an ability did or how it worked. It was pretty self-explanatory from the dice they were rolling. Never read a single character sheet nor referenced the playtest docs for a character mechanic. <br/><br/>Yeah, that was pleasing. I'm used to D&amp;D being a mess of let-me-read-the-books for understanding how stuff works. If every player ability continues to be described, mechanically, in a paragraph, then I'll probably buy in just to have an easy system to drop on new gamers looking for the "Classic Experience."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388051/#Comment_388051" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-24T08:08:46+00:00" title="August 24, 2012  8:08AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Teataine; Just curious, what problems did the skill system cause in your game?
