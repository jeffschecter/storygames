One of the other guys in my gaming group also bought a copy. We've talked our group into playing. Based on what I've heard for several years, I'm excited. <br/><br/>I've read reviews and actual plays that have raised questions in my mind. I suspect the answer to my questions are probably, you know, in the book. But, the thing is, the book hasn't arrived from Amazon yet, and the waiting is getting to me. So, the way stocking stuffers help children sleep on the night before Christmas or the way that nicotine gum helps a smoker get through the day -- I thought maybe some discussion could ease my longing. <br/><br/>So, specifically, it is my understanding that the hub and spokes (which I already have) is, itself, a playable game -- which makes it sound like the other subsystems: duel of wits, fight, &amp;c. are somewhat optional. Do any experienced players have recommendations for different configurations. By that I mean, are there subsystems you keep, some you replace, and some you ignore? Is the game best for you if you keep every speck of it? <br/><br/>I can imagine people saying things like, "wait until it arrives and play it as written; then you can start fiddling with it once you have the complete experience." And, right right, I'm sure that's what we'll do. But, forget about that advice for a second. I'm still curious about what different groups do. It's methadone time. Thanks.                   </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411106/#Comment_411106" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-02T12:24:18+00:00" title="April  2, 2013 12:24PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://canonpuncture.geekyandgenki.com/canon-puncture-81-game-advocates-%E2%80%93-burning-wheel/" rel="nofollow">Maybe this will help.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411107/#Comment_411107" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-02T12:26:49+00:00" title="April  2, 2013 12:26PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome.

I like to think of the subsystems as zooming in and going slow-mo. Don't do it for goblins or buying shoes. It takes a long time and not every interaction matters as much as every other one. This is the director John Woo's problem. Everything is in slow-mo. You want to do it for stuff that you care about. <br/><br/>Also, there is a rule where the GM picks how zoomed in (which subsystems) to use, but then the players can zoom it in or out one level depending on how much they care. The GM might pick Fight! but if no one cares, do Bloody Versus and then get to the good stuff. <br/><br/>And if you want to zoom way out and speed it along, don't forget Say Yes. <br/><br/>(This interfaces with bangs; the GM can see what stuff seems challenging and important and keep banging the beliefs that get "zoomed in on". Make the movie full of good parts and just imply the other stuff to keep the fiction justified feeling). <br/><br/>Note: I think you might be asking how much effort you need to put into getting everyone on board with all the rules. I'm not going to sugar coat this for you; BW rewards rules mastery. Not just in a min-maxy way, but it is simply more fun if you start to grasp the way the systems interlock, and everyone at the table should get at least somewhat on that level.<br/><br/>Play The Sword. It is well-crafted, easy to run, and perfect for showing off a few of the sub-systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411142/#Comment_411142" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-02T18:19:56+00:00" title="April  2, 2013  6:19PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mathalus is right-on with the "zooming in, zooming out" analogy.

Also, I totally agree with using Duel of Wits first.

As long as the players aren't resistant to learning new things you'll pick up rules mastery along the way. Focus on creating and challenging beliefs, and creating beliefs that you know how to challenge. Pay attention to what's working, what feels wonky. Expect your understanding of the game to evolve over time and just enjoy it. My two cents anyway.<br/><br/>And yes, the AdBu is awesome!
