He was sold on the game almost even before we got done reading the instructions.<br/><br/>We told a fantastic story of a community of mostly-orphans that explored the differences between religious/scientific views of events and the struggle between using resources for commerce or for combat readiness. We also weaved those things together with some supernatural elements (including a tree growing mysteriously in the middle of a river, ritualistic burying of beached fish, and a song that kept reappearing in unexpected places) that retroactively turned out to be harbingers of the Frost Shepherds' arrival (which happened on the 2nd week of Winter).<br/><br/>While I think I still prefer playing this with 3 or 4 people, the 2-player version had some great dynamics. We instinctively kept playing devil's advocate with each other, yet our visions for where the game should go started converging about mid-Summer and playing devil's advocate soon served only to coax the story in the direction that was most satisfying; we had bought into the caring-about-the-ant-farm philosophy the game suggests without even really realizing it. It was pretty awesome.<br/><br/>The only problem I had was the problem I usually have when introducing this game: enforcing the brevity that really makes the game sing. I tend to try and lead by example instead of corralling, but it doesn't always work. If anyone has suggestions they are welcome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414711/#Comment_414711" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-24T15:10:12+00:00" title="May 24, 2013  3:10PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The only problem I had was the problem I usually have when introducing this game: enforcing the brevity that really makes the game sing.

I think that one key is to make it clear that it's not a <i>restriction</i>, but an invitation to <i>experience</i> something beautiful.<br/><br/>So maybe before reading the rules, command everyone's attention and say with a smile, "There is a weird dynamic in this game. We don't talk much. We don't have rolling conversations like in most games. And as a result there is this minimalist &amp; ethereal beauty to many sessions. The more we embrace this aesthetic, the more interesting the game gets. I'm excited about that."<br/><br/>Just in some way make it clear that this is <i>an exciting thing</i>, rather than a difficult requirement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
