Because I find it so damn difficult to keep a hold on the story. Even when I'm taking notes, even when I writing plot elements that others introduce on post-in notes and sticking them in the middle of the table, we all had to back up several times and meta-game (i.e. talk about what had happened in the story, what was happening in the story and how the story might progress) before we could then continue on with playing the game.<br/><br/>Is this just me? Have others enjoyed, but also struggled with, Forsooth! ? If so, what have you done to be able to keep going instead of having to check-in with each other repeatedly?<br/><br/>Also, any suggestions as how to speed up the set-up? (I'm familiar with the pregens but I don't particularly want to use them because I want to keep the feeling of group creation.)                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sliberty" title="Sliberty"><img alt="Sliberty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sliberty">Sliberty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410599/#Comment_410599" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-27T13:42:44+00:00" title="March 27, 2013  1:42PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 27, 2013 1:43PM by Sliberty.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Initial setup of Forsooth! is very important. Here's the process I go through to ensure a good cast quickly:<br/><br/>0) Create the setting<br/>1) Everyone make one character simultaneously, leaving the Oath and/or Motivation blank<br/>2) One at a time, everyone read their character (name, natures, and dramatis personi) out loud to the table<br/>3) One at a time (as they come up with an idea for it) players speak out loud and write down their Oath / Motivation.<br/><br/>The most important thing here is to make sure that your Oaths, Motivations, and Dramatis Personi reference the other characters. Feel free to change up Oaths and Motivations during this phase. If you are playing with 2 characters per player or more, this is when you start to create your second character. Make sure this second character ties in tightly with an opposing player's character, or multiple opposing characters. Having established relationships with opposing characters creates good opportunities for interaction right away.<br/><br/>No one player should make two characters with a strong relationship with one another... they will never be in the same scene together! Many players make this mistake: for instance, they create the King and his beloved daughter, and then they never interact because they both have the same actor playing them.<br/><br/>As far as making the plot move, I suggest deliberately setting things in motion early on. For instance, in the first scene or second scene, you can mention "The Queen's Masked Ball." Players tend to latch on to things like this, and build them up. You know this will end up happening later, and when it does, it will be extra epic because it was foreshadowed, and the players are all anticipating it.<br/><br/>When the Bard eventually sets the scene there, there's palpable excitement around the table, and something climactic usually happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
