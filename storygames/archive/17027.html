I'm going to be running one tomorrow (a game in the Serenity verse) and I'm looking for inspiration. The crew is going to be a custom lot of characters and Jayne, who has jumped crews since his time on Serenity.<br/><br/>Lady Blackbird is super easy to run (ran it for the first time yesterday with a different group). I was also considering hacking Technoir to play in the Serenity verse. It's a little more work, and I'm not thrilled with how the Adjective system works for "damage" (ran it last week and that was confusing to our players), but it could be fun.<br/><br/>Any advice?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_386935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/386935/#Comment_386935" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-12T20:56:59+00:00" title="August 12, 2012  8:56PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 12, 2012 8:58PM by nemomeme.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My first double-post.

Good luck with that, letting them play their own custom-built characters make you braver than me in a hack of a specific canon.

I was totally expecting a fight over Mal and River. Most of them are diehard fans of the canon though, and turned down the opportunity to play the Crew for fear of cheapening them. That level of dedication on their part makes me a bit nervous of not being completely ready to run this.

It was effectively Castle Blackbird rules - no keys or secrets and dice pool additions had to tag other traits on the character. One thing I noticed about the rules change (used standard LB rules the other day) was that more people were willing to give up dice to help their companions. I think that was because the number of your own dice you could allocate was lower than usual, if only slightly.<br/><br/>All-in-all, it went very well. Rolling dice was slower because of having to allocate normal tags and dice pool, so I won't be using that again (going back to standard LB). The only good thing about the dice pool needing allocation was the introduction of the ability to cross-trait tag. It made the dice pool more evocative, if slower.<br/><br/>Jayne was the only Serenity crew member chosen, and his player created him somewhat freewheeled (chose the "cat" tag on Goddamn Crazy and had a kitten with him all the time...). Everyone else created custom characters. They had 4 traits (one primarily for combat, profession, social and a personal action - all renamed, of course) and 16 tags. It took less than 5 minutes to create each character. <br/><br/>Because there were so many combat specialists we decided their primary job was bounty hunting, and their ship, the Normandy (ME throwback on their part), was outfitted with that goal in mind. I rewrote the description of the Owl (using 90% of the original) to represent the Normandy.<br/><br/>For simplicity, I stuck with typical Lady Blackbird story for the first session. Their recent bounty was wanted by the Alliance, but they were unwilling to pay. They were all stuck in the brig while their bounty was being questioned. They broke out, split into groups (2 going after the bounty, 2 to engineering and 2 to the armory to retrieve their gear). They all met up at the ship after disabling the Hand of Sorrow's (used the name) combat and navigational systems and took off to deliver their bounty to a paying constable on a border colony, which went well after Jayne threatened his life for shortchanging them.<br/><br/>In the end, it was pretty standard LB fair. The group were first timers with LB and they took to it very easily, and loved it. We'll definitely be playing some approximation of this game again.<br/><br/>LB receives my groups stamp of approval for a game in the Serenity verse. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387025/#Comment_387025" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T21:46:33+00:00" title="August 13, 2012  9:46PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat.

It was effectively Castle Blackbird rules - no keys or secrets and dice pool additions had to tag other traits on the character. One thing I noticed about the rules change (used standard LB rules the other day) was that more people were willing to give up dice to help their companions. I think that was because the number of your own dice you could allocate was lower than usual, if only slightly.<br/><br/>All-in-all, it went very well. Rolling dice was slower because of having to allocate normal tags and dice pool, so I won't be using that again (going back to standard LB). The only good thing about the dice pool needing allocation was the introduction of the ability to cross-trait tag. It made the dice pool more evocative, if slower.</blockquote>\nI think this is the first time I've seen any actual critique of my <i>Castle Blackbird</i> hack of LB, even though it was sort of hacked itself. I'm interested if you have any suggestions for making it work better. I was eventually going to use it as a basis for some grand and foolish attempt at making a Star Wars campaign (though I have been sidetracked since I had that thought).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks" title="RyanDanks"><img alt="RyanDanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RyanDanks">RyanDanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387034/#Comment_387034" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-13T23:28:24+00:00" title="August 13, 2012 11:28PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I said, I found the dice pool allocation to slow things down, although not by a whole lot - WoD is still MUCH longer. That was off set by the fact that the dice pool evoked the character traits much better, so I'm on the fence about it. The tie-breaker would probably be for, however, as tagging from multiple traits was a lot of fun. <br/><br/>Not one player was willing to take a complication or condition to earn XP. I like not having Keys, so I was looking forward to that part, unfortunately no one took advantage. It may have been in my presentation though, maybe in need of more play testing. <br/><br/>Since this was Serenity we didn't play with Magic and power levels, so I can't speak to that. <br/><br/>I like your method of setting up obstacles, although it was a bit confusing at first. However, since I made mine up on the spot, I didn't find myself using it - I stuck to the original challenge levels in LB. <br/><br/>I'm interested in playing through the Castle Blackburd setting, so we'll probably try out the magic system at some point. <br/><br/>In short, Lady Blackbird felt faster and more free, but Castle Blackbird gave us more crunch and a faster character generation (by removing Keys and Secrets, which I was never a fan of). The only thing I'm on the fence about is the allocating of the dice pool, although I think it is better for the story. <br/><br/>Hope that helps. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_387100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387100/#Comment_387100" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-14T15:13:17+00:00" title="August 14, 2012  3:13PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2012 3:13PM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting.
