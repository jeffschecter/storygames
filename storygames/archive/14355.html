Okay great.  You are playing The Dude, and you say...'It's my turn, but I don't want to frame a scene, anyone have any ideas?'<br/>Now your buddy Joe over here says 'Yes, two strong men break down your door and start shouting about the money you owe them and how they're going to break your legs.  They are constantly shouting your name in a mocking way, imposing their power over you.'  So then Joe and Dave start to take on the roles of the two angry men, and you all roleplay the scene as you feel it.<br/><br/>After a few minutes, they've pissed on your rug, your head is in the toilet and you're fighting for air.  So now at this point you reach in to the middle of the table and grab a White Die, and everybody knows you are gearing towards a good ending.<br/><br/>'I'm telling you, you have the wrong Lebowski' you repeat, even though you've said it like five times already.  Joe and Dave take the hint, the scene is going to end well for you, so they start to show doubt.  'Yeah, this place is a sh*thole, man.  No way this is our guy.'  But you want a <i>good</i> ending, so you push a little harder.  'Who sent you guys anyway?' and they tell you.  Now you have a name to call on.  Now you have some possibility of retaliation for your very fine rug."<br/><br/><br/>Has anyone else been doing this?  Has the response been mixed?  Is there a better way to frame this?<br/><br/>Sometimes I do this, and sometimes I just have a ringer with me and we move through a scene really quickly to set the tone and the ritual.<br/>And I'm not just talking Fiasco here, either.  Just a quick punchy example.<br/><br/>What else works?<br/><br/>[Edited for typos]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326170/#Comment_326170" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T13:07:41+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  1:07PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use it for teaching Primetime Adventures.

Even if people have not seen Zatoichi movies, just the description helps a little.<br/><br/>Basically, there's a mechanic that's kind of like Fan Mail ("Aiki Chits"): <br/>*You have Fates, which are basically Spiritual Attributes from The Riddle of Steel: Things like "Goal: Kill the Evil Clan Lord" "Relationship: Friends with Purple Lightning" etc.(1)<br/>*You roleplay well, someone gives you an Aiki chit. (2)<br/>*You hold these chits for later. <br/>*During a between-act Intermission scene, you cash in these Fan Mail chits for Kiai, basically (and very generally) a "bonus dice"/"extra attacks"/"Uber stunts" resource.<br/>*You spend all these Kiai points doing awesome stuff, or taking out powerful bosses in combat. (3)<br/>*Afterwards, those Kiai points you spend turn to Karma, and your Karma level goes up.<br/>*If your Karma hits a certain mark, your character goes crazy and becomes an NPC.<br/>*So you need to lower/change your Fates. In case of dramatic Kiai spending/Karma increase, erasing them altogether is the only way to lower your character under the crazy mark. (4)<br/><br/>Anyway, this has tons of analogues in Japanese serialized dramas, but profoundly so with the Zatoichi movies. <br/>(1) Zatoichi rolls into a new town. he makes friends with the elderly couple. He attracts the love of the 5-year-old girl at the market. He starts a relationship with the young tavern lady.<br/>(2) He builds up these relationships over time, interacting with them plus the seedy folks around town. <br/>Troubles rides into town, usually in the form of a gang/yakuza overstepping their bounds. <br/>(3) Zatoichi busts out his sword, killing off tons of dudes with brilliant-fast strikes ("blowing tons of bonus dice on each roll").<br/>Zatoichi is like "oh shit, what have I done?"<br/>(4) While there's generally a happy ending for the townspeople, Zatoichi splits: He hides from the people he loves and escapes into the night, saying "I just bring trouble to these people, they are better off without me".<br/>He burns off his relationships.<br/><br/>Anyway, the Zatoichi movies (as well as other shows, everything from Mito Komon to Hissatsu Shigotonon (my fave) <a href="http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Hissatsu_Shigotonin" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Hissatsu_Shigotonin</a> and it looks like you can watch them here: <a href="http://www.dramastyle.com/drama/Hissatsu-Shigotonin-2009/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dramastyle.com/drama/Hissatsu-Shigotonin-2009/</a><br/><br/>Mostly Japanese pop culture, but people can easily grasp it even if they haven't seen it. And it's the best tool to explain the above rather complicated system of dice-power-emotion-karma relationships.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326194/#Comment_326194" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T15:06:14+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  3:06PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I use pop culture to teach D&amp;D alignment more often than not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jerome_Larre" title="Jerome_Larre"><img alt="Jerome_Larre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://tengajdr.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/smallavatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jerome_Larre">Jerome_Larre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326243/#Comment_326243" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T22:00:43+00:00" title="May 24, 2011 10:00PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2011 10:11PM by Jerome_Larre.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I almost always do.<br/>\nAnd almost always with examples from Star wars.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326251/#Comment_326251" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T22:23:53+00:00" title="May 24, 2011 10:23PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jerome Larre</cite>I almost always do.<br/>And almost always with examples from Star wars.</blockquote>\nI'd like to hear some if you're willing?

It is also made to embed conflict, but I usually don't bother players with this at this time. Instead, I don't know whether it is the right way to call this, but it often compare this to a wishlist.<br/>\nMost of the time, this isn't enough and I need to give them a few more example about how to do this. I almost always ask them to assume we will use this to play together a star wars campaign based on the original three films. Why star wars? Because everybody knows. Even people who haven't seen them know most of the main points of the movies.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds something like this (it is usually though a lot of questions and answers, it is hard for me to write it down here, especially in another language):<br/>\n- Ok, so you wanna play Luke Skywalker and you want the campaign to be something very similar to star wars. First tell me, what is your CONCEPT. It just means, what is Luke Skywalker at the beginning of the movies? A pilot? No. A Jedi? No. Yes, he is just a farmer on Tattoine. So, if you come to me and ask me to make a campaign about your farmer boy character, I will probably set up something like "Death at the Mos Eisley Annual Agricultural Fair". You might enjoy it or not, but it doesn't even remotely sounds like Star wars. Something is missing.<br/>\n- So you can come again and tell me you still want to play a farmer boy, but he doesn"t want to stay a farmer boy. That's good, because now we are talking about his AMBITION. What does Luke Skywalker wants to become at the beginning of the movies? Boss of the bad guys. Or more accuratly pilot (which means officer, or boss) at the Empire pilot academy (which pretty much means "of the bad guys"), to be like his father. Well, then I would work again on my campaign and I will propose you something different. But it won't be star wars yet. It will be somthing around the story of a famer boy wanting to become a pilot. Actually you wanted Star wars and I will make you play Top Gun ! Watch out for the canopy !<br/>\n- Well, you come for the third time and you tell me what you want your character to become. That\u2019s KARMA. So you want your farmer boy who wants to be a pilot to actually become some kind of mystical warrior (which includes cool powers, moral high ground and even cooler lightsabers) but having hard time to fulfill his training. Well, that\u2019s great, because, now I have these three elements, I propose you something which will be much closer to what you actually wanna play and what you think is important in star wars. And still, I will have enough room to surprise you. You shouldn\u2019t have never told me about this pilot dad of yours\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this is clear enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also often use the "Empire strikes back" movie as an example to show the player how failure can be interesting if we play it to the end. Usually I ask players if they remember what the character are doing at the begining of this movie (fleeing), at the end (fleeing), and almost always between the begining and the end. Then I ask them if they can remember the main cast actually suceeding in some major action (conflict actually) which is not fleeing and they do on purpose in the movie. Usually they can't answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*For more info about the game : http://www.legrog.org/jeux/tenga/tenga-fr                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326298/#Comment_326298" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T08:48:04+00:00" title="May 25, 2011  8:48AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was very clear.

I'll talk about wire-fu and bullet time in the Matrix or the gun-kata from Equilibrium.  It's easy to take any action sequence and decontruct it as a set of details that the 'player' described happening in the movie.  Slow motion, sound effects, clever dialog, and enemy actions all can be included to turn every player into a Hong Kong action movie director.  Bruce Lee* is the poster child for describing how to do Wushu martial combat.  :-)<br/>--<br/>TAZ<br/><br/><br/>* Insert Jackie Chan if that's more your style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326372/#Comment_326372" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T14:07:01+00:00" title="May 25, 2011  2:07PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice.

Would you like a cup of tea (by the way I am evil).  Hmm...  how shall someone\u2013 as evil as I\u2013 comb my hair?"    [See also: 'Wolverine is a badass']<br/><br/>Ripley-style characters are vibrant and Lecter-style characters are tedious-- in games where a tough personal/moral/ethical/emotional choice is at stake, and there's a 'reveal' about which option the character will choose.<br/><br/>But, one-note characters are fine in games where we already know the guy is gonna the same thing he always does-- and the fun is in seeing just how far he'll go with it this time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326845/#Comment_326845" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-29T15:41:45+00:00" title="May 29, 2011  3:41PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elliott Belser</cite>All of the time.
