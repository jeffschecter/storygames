Quite possibly, it will be played with at least some strangers ( as at a convention) or with your regular play group, but with no assumption of familiarity with the mechanics being used prior to meeting up for the session.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Self-contained rules</span><br/>The mechanics for the thing are assumed to contain just the rules necessary to run the specific game in question, not any game set in the fictional game universe.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scenario</span><br/>The characters + situation have just enough back-story to show a general set-up, with the action begining at some sort of tipping point wherew those things begin to collide, and the play of the game itself has at least a broadly painted direction to it.<br/><br/>To bring this back to earth, I'll give a little context. A while back, I started a thread about building Braunstein-style games. I managed to build one, and I'll be throwing it out for testing tomorrow. At this point, I'm thinking that I really enjoyed the designing end of that, and have enjoyed playing some similar things, such as a one-shot Wodehouse inspired LARP.<br/><br/>I'd like to put together more of this kind of thing, and I'd also like to put together some kind of document talking about building this kind of thing.<br/><br/>I'd appreciate any feedback from folks who have built or played in similar games, especially regarding the following sorts of problems/issues:<br/><br/>- Presentation of background material and rules<br/>-Dealing with time constraints, both in terms of initial start up and ending the game<br/>-Insuring that characters + situation collide/interact rather than hare off wildly<br/>-The role and duties of the designer/presenter of the game<br/>-Building or stealing mechanics directly important to the specific game, without going to mechanics overload<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>R                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
