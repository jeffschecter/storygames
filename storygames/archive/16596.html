They would certainly ground the fiction a lot more in situations like these, and my players are used to taking things through with people, so we definitely need to hash out a "fix" for this issue. <br/><br/>Any suggestions? I can post the "social weapons" list if folks are interested and would be up for giving a little feedback.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White" title="Mel_White"><img alt="Mel_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">Mel_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379823/#Comment_379823" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-26T12:20:48+00:00" title="May 26, 2012 12:20PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zac,<br/>Would love to see your social weapons list.<br/>Mel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379841/#Comment_379841" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-26T21:56:16+00:00" title="May 26, 2012  9:56PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, sounds great Zac!

Here you go... <br/><br/><i>Positioning: it's abstract. In physical combat, it's the distance between you and your opponent. <br/>But what if you're having an argument, trying to shame someone, etc? <br/>When you engage in an emotional battle, you will deploy speech as your weapon. Public vs. private context matters. <br/><br/>When you socially position yourself or another, say how you're trying to bring them closer or push them away, and then roll name die + orate (in public) OR insight (in private) vs. their name die + orate or insight. If you win, your opponent must move first (or you can force them to move somewhere, on your turn), and like normal, you can only force someone else to move if they rolled worse than you. <br/><br/><br/>In an emotional battle, your distance is your emotional distance, a measure of how emotionally engaged or removed you are from the situation.<br/>Note - - the \u201cstarting distance\u201d table applies exactly the same. The more intimate your physical circumstances, the more emotionally intense the moment is between you. <br/>Get distance to start ignoring or telling them off to dissuade them, or go for the jugular by spilling their darkest secrets. <br/>Just like normal, take a penalty for being out of optimal range. A shameful revelation is most painful when shared with onlookers, but sometimes a whispered reminder of things forgotten is the most painful thing of all. For that matter, if you are trying to snub them and you're very close together, it's going to be a challenge to get emotionally distant (literally) so as to effectively ignore them. <br/><br/>Here are some social attacks, which you declare at the beginning of each round (except debt): <br/><b>when you betray someone's secret to others</b>, you may attack them with your name + insight + d8+1, range 5-6 - in public. Betraying their secrets is a violation of trust, and they will not listen to any talk of debts owed, this exchange \u2013 i.e. you cannot use a \u201cshield\u201d. (betrayal/bow)<br/><b>when you remind them of their darkest shame</b>, you attack using insight, range 1 - in private. Split 2d6 any way you like between your hands. (reminder/sword)<br/><b>when you refuse to let them speak to you</b>, you may attack with your name + cunning + d8+1, range 5-6. Cannot use a debt to protect yourself when you don't even want to engage; that is, you cannot use guilt on someone and ignore them at the same time. (refusal/bow)<br/><b>when you personally insult someone</b>, you may attack with your name + orate + d6+1, range 2-4. You can carry an insult in either (insult/javelin)<br/><b>when you deliver a shocking message</b>, you get 1d6 and 1d8; they go in opposite hands. You attack and defend using orate. (message/spear)<br/><br/>EXCEPTION: if you remind them of their debt to you, for the rest of the battle you may defend using your name + d8 + cunning unless you need to drop it to use a betrayal. (debt/shield)<br/><br/>\tHere are some special \u201cmaneuvers\u201d you can use.<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Misdirection</span>: if you involve a bystander or change the subject, roll your name + cunning vs. your opponent's name + orate; each success puts them off by -2 on their next roll. If you fail, reduce your cunning by 1 step. <br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dismissal</span>: pick an enemy within 2 range bands. If you talk over them, roll your name + orate vs. your opponent's name + spirit; if you win, you knock one of your opponent's \u201cweapons\u201d from their hand for x exchanges, where x = your victories on your roll. If you fail, their words are still heard by those present.<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And Furthermore</span>: if you have a message or an insult in your left hand, you may elect to attack a second time, using that weapon's dice in your left hand instead of using them for defense during this exchange. <br/><br/>Here is how armor works:<br/>\tEach fact listed below, if it applies to you, gives you one die of armored protection as normal. First piece grants d6, 2nd bumps it to d8, 3rd bumps it to d10, but each piece also penalizes -1 to one stat or type of stat.<br/>\tUnlike physical armor, social \u201carmor\u201d is equipped by giving out information (true or false) about yourself, along the following lines:<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Of gentle birth</span>: you're a hero, aren't you? If you reveal yourself as such, you rise head and shoulders above your foes, as far as honor is concerned. But a noble repute is demanding; -1positioning because you must use words befitting a nobleman. (greaves)<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unknown to me</span>: if you choose to pretend you do not know them, or you really do not know them, in truth, then you may speak more freely, for you are unburdened by personal loyalty. Also take -1insight because you either do not know them personally or you must not let on that you do. Their reaction to this is their own affair. (helm)<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The mission</span>: if you have pressing business and needs must have this person's cooperation (even if that means they need but leave you alone), you may impress upon them the gravity of your task. If you do so, your honorable purpose is your protection. Take -1orate because speaking of duty weighs down your words with import. (breastplate)<br/><br/>\tNote that each of these could apply to each side of the conflict. They need to, or the sides would have to fight for who got to \u201cclaim\u201d one or all, and that would make \u201csocial\u201d armor work too differently from physical armor for my liking. <br/><br/>\tWounds are a risk in battles of all sorts. But when you are defeated by emotional wounds, you do not die, but must be consoled, comforted, or spiritually restored to become whole again. However, you heal them as you would physical ones. </i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379882/#Comment_379882" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-27T20:17:32+00:00" title="May 27, 2012  8:17PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            oooh, that is wonderful Zac!

I don't think the range band helps with this issue, even though it is quite elegant and simplifying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
