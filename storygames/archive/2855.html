I am basically staking this spot to get an AP up. I can't type much now, but I can link everyone to my new character sheets and con notes:<br/><br/><a href="http://tsoy.schtuff.com/" rel="nofollow">TSOY</a><br/><br/>I think I found a neat interaction in the last game that  I really want to talk about. I think I'm prepared now with an interesting choice for the players: choose one of two paths - one leads to possible victory and the other to doom and betrayal. Just, how do you make that obvious and sound tantalizing for both choices?<br/><br/>I will post more later. I'm really proud of my character sheets.

I'll list the changes when I can. (I know I'm posting, but I'm posting in between job functions).<br/><br/>The Dungeon is currently a set of scenes laid out by choices. Basically, how each scene is dealt with determines which one I frame next. In the last game I ran, I only shared two of the same scenes. It's like a choose  your own adventure, except it is determined by how much interest and in what ways you dealt with each scene - which all have sapient, albeit inhuman, adversaries. That is, all of the creatures in the Dungeon have the following characteristics:<br/><br/>1. They can be reasoned with in addition to being fought.<br/>2. They have an agenda, and goals.<br/>3. They have different points of view on the situation at hand.<br/><br/>Defeating the Dungeon at this point has meant choosing the right path to make it to the Black Pool and defeating it via BDtP. I always state that if something is named, whether it is an object, a goblin, or a creature, it has to be defeated in BDtP for permanent success.<br/><br/>While I've never had anyone attempt to Sway the Black Pool, I have had two successful attempts to sway a God-Fuzed Statue of Destruction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65304/#Comment_65304" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T11:04:15+00:00" title="April 25, 2007 11:04AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, here we go. Three parts to this:<br/><br/>1. Character Revisions<br/>2. Actual Play<br/>3. Ideas for Improving the Scenario<br/><br/>Part 1 - Character Revisions<br/>Friday night, I get home at about 10 and start working. I need to design new character sheets. My thought was that I wasn't fully grabbing people's imaginations with the previous ones (not to dis Jason's work - what I did was inspired from them).  Since I had stolen the images from the internet for each of the characters, I was also modifying the characters to match the images. I kept all of them with the same Abilities and Pools, and did some modifications of to the Keys and Secrets.<br/><br/>So, once I had a template down, I had to decide what to change. I brought together the character descriptions from extra verbage in their Keys and by way of canonizing what had happened that was awesome in the previous run of the scenario. Each ended up a little less of a blank sheet and put all of the need to know information in one spot. No one seemed over- or underwhelmed by the amount of information. Each session started within 15 minutes of dispersing the character sheets. Each group loved knowing beforehand what they thought of each other - they read every character sheet fully before choosing. I specifically left each one with one party member that could make up their mind completely on.<br/><br/>Canonization: <br/>Theodred wants to return his Clan's Lands to their previous status.<br/>Arthes lost track of her lover who went to get her family relic for her to prove his love. She will encounter him in the dungeon.<br/>Kemp - Kemp used to be male. Due to the image for her, Kemp is now female. Each group expressed no concern for homosexuality as presented in the game. I gave them the ability to avoid it if necessary - inventing the concept of being Feystruck.<br/>Piotr - I changed Piotr's name from Aubrey (which was just a personal thing, I guess). I firmly showed what the conflicting Keys mean for Piotr in his description.<br/><br/>As to changes, I started with Theodred, the Dwarf. I changed his Hammer to an Axe to match the image. No other thoughts behind it than that. Eric Provost had given me the idea before to make the Dwarf mystically tied to the Black Pool, so I created a Secret for it, on the sheet called Black Pool. I basically wanted to give a hint at the final fate of the previous Dwarfs - I'll explain what I mean with that in the Actual Play. When I got done with that, I realized I wanted something visual for that spot in the middle of the sheet, so I used the copyright symbol from a font I had and made it really big. One player told me he was disappointed that it wasn't part of the mechanics of the game. Man, I wish it had! But I have an idea for that ... more on it later. I stray off path.<br/><br/>Next, I reviewed his Keys from the last time and kept them as-is. The Dwarf was good to go.<br/><br/>Arthes was next. No changes that I hadn't already discussed. I removed the mention of being a Shield Maiden simply because it wasn't in her image.<br/><br/>On to Kemp. The big changes for Kemp were making her a woman and updating her Key of Impotence. I have only one Disarm Trap in my mind for the scenario so I enhanced it to anything that I felt Nervous Fingers ought to apply to. One player used this particularly well: She took the XP for the big Trap, failed and Brought Down the Pain to allow her to finally win. I liked that scene.<br/><br/>Finally, Piotr. I kept Piotr whole cloth from last time, except renaming the Key of Doom into the Key of Recklessness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65341/#Comment_65341" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T14:02:07+00:00" title="April 25, 2007  2:02PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part 2 - Actual Play<br/><br/>Hmm, I've had to rewrite this section. Doing an AP report with all the coolness and treating it like a Story Hour for TWO groups is insane. Too many back and forths. Let's do this. I'll mention what worked well and didn't in each group. Also, this means that anyone that wants to play in my scenario at Nerdly or otherwise in the future won't feel like they shouldn't be reading this.<br/><br/>Here's the basic plot outline: Arthes, the elf, wants to discover the fate of her lover and recover her family Relic. I made the Relic older than her family and I tell people that when I start the game. The elf family name comes from the Relic, and not vice versa. Theodred wants to reclaim the Dwarf City. Kemp wants follow Arthes, and is the only person Theodred knows that can open the Vault to the Black Pool. His estimate of the Vault's traps and her abilities are both by reputation alone. Piotr weaseled his way into the trip for a chance for violence - and every player has figured out that goblins convert well after being pounded, too.<br/><br/>After descending into the Dungeon, hints are dropped that the goblins are very similar to the Dwarf. There is some curse by the Black Pool (which always catches the Dwarf player off guard because they see it as a cool feature of the character). There are two tribes of goblins, and one is far worse than the other. It has taken up residence by the Vault that closes off the Black Pool. Cadafan is usually encountered as a ghost, having been slain and corrupted by the Black Pool goblins, but making his way to holy ground where a Dwarf temple lay in ruins, and needs to be dealt with one way or another. Given the actions of the characters, not everyone makes the Black Pool; if they do, they can fight it back - win, it goes away forever; lose - it corrupts everyone.<br/><br/>Things that worked out well:<br/>A good player makes Piotr do some crazy stuff. He can convert and smash. I've seen him Sway the alien mind of a Spider Queen. I tell people that we create Secrets as we need them (and I give them some idea of what can and can't be done). One player asked to have some Holy oomph added to his Sway and so we created a Secret of Holy Words. This was great! Everyone was awed that a non-game breaking totally characterized thing like that could just be created on the fly. <br/>Making Kemp want to betray the party for her love of Arthes brought some fantastic scenes from one group. I have this weapon set that totally makes it worth it, too.<br/>Arthes never got a chance to resolve her issues with Cadafan in either game (in the second one, she wasn't even a PC). I need to make that happen much earlier (which is easy to do). In the second game, as a ghost, she fought alongside Kemp as she betrayed the group for Arthes' promised love in return. It was totally awesome.<br/>Theodred is the center of the game, usually. And it always freaks out the player when they find out that the corruption of the Black Pool for Dwarfs is to become a goblin - which they usually do AFTER having slaughtered hundreds of mindless goblins. I revealed this in a totally separate way in the second game. As Kemp could no longer open the Vault to allow them to defeat the Pool, Theodred goes on to become the Goblin King, and spread the Pool to other Dwarf strongholds. Kemp's player in the second game made a killer Secret that really let her take on her peers in a two on one battle royale.<br/>Every time someone bought off a Key, it was a great scene.<br/><br/>My XP are always a hit:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://tsoy.schtuff.com/runebound_money_jpg?action=binary&amp;ver=1"/><br/><br/>They are from the Runebound board game.<br/><br/>Things that didn't work out well:<br/>In the first group, a player ignored my Honor system for XP and took 5 XP for any action he took that resembled his Keys. He ended up buying two Grand Master Abilities and nearly ruining the game for us. I found out afterward that he does this shit in every game that he plays in.<br/>In the first group, I spent too much time explaining the rules. Due to immediate feedback, I fixed it for the second group and feel like the One - Two punch of familiar tropes (Dungeon Crawl) and making everything on the sheet as self-explanatory or evocative as possible made it an quick trip from explaining Keys and Secrets to actual Gameplay.<br/>Some things that I always mean to introduce I forget. I never give enough regular weapons, armor, gold or jewels to hit the Keys that need them. Also, the delayed introduction of Cadafan can really make Arthes a short-shrifted character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65531/#Comment_65531" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-26T13:14:14+00:00" title="April 26, 2007  1:14PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part 3 - Ideas for Improving the Scenario<br/>So, one player commented that he was disappointed that the swirl in the middle of the character sheet didn't have something to do with the mechanics in the game. I have an idea for this.<br/><br/>The 'corruption' of the Black Pool should be available to anyone willing to accept it. This allows for some nasty cool characterization. Here's how I'd do it:<br/><br/>In the center of the table, put out some black Fudge dice. These are 'helper' dice that anyone can offer someone else, roleplaying the agency of the Black Pool. Everyone should have an agreed upon mindset as to what the Black Pool offers help for. Basically, you can sway someone's actions to something the Pool would want, for the help that it gives. In tighter GM games (like this one suggests), the GM might be the only agent of the Pool.<br/><br/>When someone takes that help, they have to choose a Key or Secret to corrupt. These Keys or Secrets are now 'corrupted' and can only be cleansed during a Refresh scene. The Refresh scene, to be an act of Cleansing, must also show some act of sacrifice on the character's part. Otherwise, it works in all other ways a Refresh scene normally does. Also, a combined Heal and Counsel ability test might be able to cure the corruption.<br/><br/>If I had time, I'd come up with some Secrets and Keys that were only 'purchasable' at certain corruption levels. Finally, if all of your Keys and Secrets and corrupted, you are completely corrupted and would gain a Key of Corruption (which is automatically corrupted, and never can become uncorrupted).
