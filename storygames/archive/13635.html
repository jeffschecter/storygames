And afterwards I felt so sorry for the Moons who couldn't take active part to it. Worse, they felt forced to emulate us in their following scene. Which was ok, only sorta dull. They were very shy, and afterwards one of them indirectly admitted that he felt our (my Mistaken and I) eyes on them and felt like they had to do something equally epic. They wanted to be protagonist of the same level of epic as us, and they imagined the two of us judging their outcome, in other words. With of course the resulting anxiety. Maybe an extreme situation, but one that made me think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RichD" title="RichD"><img alt="RichD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RichD">RichD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308210/#Comment_308210" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T11:53:11+00:00" title="January 14, 2011 11:53AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like I do in any audience situation.

I've yet to a play a really engaging game where being "audience" was a drag. In less eventful games, of course, it's a big issue.<br/><br/>However, one thing I find is that games which DO place all the characters together all the time suffer from one of two issues:<br/><br/>First, the quality of the story often suffers. Great fiction is rarely about a group of characters, and the same group of characters, who are together all the time. Private moments between characters are powerful and necessary to deeper characterization; doing everything together often stretches suspension of disbelief. <br/><br/>[Edit: exactly as Graham said, above!]<br/><br/>Second, unless the group is very small, I find that in large scenes my character is being quiet/waiting for others to speak/disclaiming authority to others so much that it's even more boring or even less engaging than being an "audience member". For instance, large-scale combat in a D&amp;D game, where a large group of characters faces off against enemies, could mean that I don't get a "turn" more often than once every 10-20 minutes. But I've found the same in situations of pure roleplay: a group of four characters is guaranteed to encounter scenes that are only interesting to two or three (or maybe even just one) of those players. The other one or two is limited to sitting back and letting the others enjoy whatever issues they are facing. Just because "my character is there" doesn't mean my interests in the game are necessarily being engaged.<br/><br/>I think I often enjoy having a range of quiet moments and active play, where bullets (or emotions) are flying. A good story often seems to demand that, so "sitting out" is a fine price for me to pay. <br/><br/>In my experience, playing a character in a large scene with many other characters involved often feels just as much like being an uninvolved audience member.<br/><br/>However, the strong and continuous engagement of being an active player all the time may be part of why I enjoy GMing as much as I do.<br/><br/>I *do* agree, also, that RPG design can and should strive to do more to engage all the participants as much as possible. I don't think we've moved as far as we can or should just yet. I'm looking forward to other responses in this thread!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308228/#Comment_308228" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T12:50:46+00:00" title="January 14, 2011 12:50PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>In much drama, the most compelling scenes are two-player scenes.

A game is where everyone is supposed to be enjoying their time actively together.

Showing up to watch a drama is different than showing up to play a drama, and I'm often comfortable ruling out "much drama" to respect that difference.  I like picking specifically inclusive dramas, like "trapped together" horror/mysteries, "tac' squad" adventures, "superhero team" missions, "band of survivors" apocalyptica, etc.<br/><br/>That said, Graham, I <i>am</i> glad that alternatives exist.

So, reactive mechanics and the like, where you take action not at a set time, but when something-or-other happens, or when you expend resources, are one potential solution.<br/><br/>The reason scenes with all the characters present can feel just as lame or inactive as pass-around-the-camera with separate storylines is that in most RPGs any kind of resolution is dependent on interaction with the GM. For example, in a game of Delve, it doesn't matter if all four characters are investigating one room, because as soon as we've said, "OK, Jim, you try picking the lock while I look through these underwear drawers," I'm effectively "sitting out" until the GM has dealt with Jim lock-picking and is ready to tell me what I find.<br/><br/>So, mechanics that can be engaged by any subset of players are an interesting potential solution. If could turn to Lisa while Jim and the GM handle the lockpicking, and she could tell me what's in the drawer, there needn't be any "audience time" at all. Oddly enough, in games like that, I often wish I could just spectate, and not miss out on what's happening with others...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308240/#Comment_308240" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T13:25:54+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  1:25PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>I find that in large scenes my character is being quiet/waiting for others to speak/disclaiming authority to others so much that it's even more boring or even less engaging than being an "audience member".</blockquote>Oh god yes, I hate this <i>way</i> worse than spectating for a few minutes.

That's a joy.  It doesn't happen all the time, though, but that's how things are in real life.  (Anyone who says their group only plays really interesting scenes is either a liar, is improbably blessed with a surplus of undiscovered improvisational geniuses, or just has <i>really low</i> standards for "interesting."  Our group does pretty well, but we don't bat a thousand.  We don't expect to.  We just do the best we can.)<br/><br/>Watching an uninteresting scene that never seems to end, or doing nothing but watching other people play (i.e., no spotlight time for me, ever) is torture, and a game-killer.  Doesn't happen often in our group, thank god.<br/><br/>The rest of the time, it's a chance for me to take a break.  I can have fun watching a scene, throwing in a comment or a suggestion or a word of praise, not really giving their scene my full, rapt attention but not ignoring it, either.  It's not the best fun in the world, but I sometimes welcome it during a game; the fact is, I don't really enjoy being "on" all the time, I need to pause to catch my breath every now and again.  Which is why I have to disagree with this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>The reason mechanical turn-based games (such as combat in many systems) can be a drag, is because you have nothing to do until "your turn".</blockquote>\n...because most of the time I don't have "nothing to do," unless I'm specifically choosing to do nothing with that free time.  I have all kinds of things I do when the spotlight is off me.  I think about where the game is going, I make plans, I organize my thoughts and my notes, I improve upon ideas I had earlier, and generally speaking I get my shit together so that when it's my turn up front, I'm going out there with my best material.  I also get to take care of base physical needs -- grab some more water, use the restroom, make a snack, chat (quietly) with someone else who also isn't in this scene.  As long as the free time I have is less than or equal to the time it takes me to do those other tasks, everything's fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308259/#Comment_308259" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T14:00:23+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  2:00PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Suna</cite>I remember one of my first games of Polaris: my Mistaken and I were escalating to epic levels our conflict, to the point that we all needed a pause to catch our breath, the scene is something I still remember as amazing.

The scene takes on an inside/outside structure locking out anything or anyone that isn't given explicit entry in its defined scope of time, space, and/or theme. And whether these scenes were truly locked before they typically become even more difficult to interact with as they get more rule intensive (like Conflict resolution in Dogs), unless there is an explicit access granted to the "audience" players.<br/><br/>What frustrates me about the prevalence of structured and mechanized scenes in so many games is that there really are other options in breaking up the narrative - there is no reason that multiple threads of times and places cannot proceed concurrently as we play, except that we need the tools (fictional and system-wise) to handle it. So literally in some cases, as an audience member I find myself frustrated because I realize that these other two audience members could be doing something nifty right now too, except the possibility did not seem to have occurred to the game's designer.<br/><br/>Certainly there are good reasons to fix and lock all progress on one scene at a time, but like all decisions about narrative flow and mechanics this shouldn't be done lightly, and the consequences should be considered carefully. <br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

The audience is often guiding the resolution and flow of the scenes, in different ways for each game.  They are audience and relatively active participants even when their own characters are not present in the scene.<br/><br/>I enjoy my turn as audience in most games I play in.  But then I'm fortunate to play most often in small groups of wonderful role-players.<br/><br/>I wonder about the design space where players who are not playing characters currently in the scene are playing some kind of silent, transparent and mostly non-distracting mini-game among themselves.  Maybe it's even a relatively crunchy one which is "powering up" their own characters for future scenes.  Better still would probably be a game that is both influencing and is influenced by the "active" players, one in which the progress/status can be taken in by those players at a glance and incorporated into the active scene somehow.<br/><br/>Damn, that would be pretty cool...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308279/#Comment_308279" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T14:57:48+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  2:57PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2011 2:58PM by Jacob.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>in much drama, the most compelling scenes are two-player scenes</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Suna</cite>A game is where everyone is supposed to be enjoying their time actively together.

My favorite scenes from past games were laser focused one-on-one drama scenes; either ones I was in, or ones I watched from the side. The bulk of my role playing fun has come from group scenes - strip these out and a lot of the fun dries up. My least favorite scenes were one-on-one drama scenes that didn't work, or felt forced. I'd rather push a mini around a map and 'roll to hit the dragon' thirty times than sit through an awkward forced drama scene.<br/><br/>I love Polaris when it works. I hate it when it doesn't. It doesn't always work. A game that focuses on mainly group play rarely reaches the same heights, but usually avoids deep deep valleys.<br/><br/>For me the perfect game would be a lot of group scenes, collaboration and participation, and could focus in on dramatic scenes when appropriate. My favorite past gaming experiences have done this very well, due to awesome players but I'd love to see this kind of play encouraged/supported more mechanically. <br/><br/>Games with scene framing rules resonate with me, especially if they can be tossed out. Not every scene needs to be framed; some unfold organically.

The nuances of which play dynamics are provoked vs dictated vs left undefined by game text is a bit beyond what I intended to discuss here, but perhaps there's no getting around it.<br/><br/>I know I've experienced a process of "game's stated intent + rules" -&gt; "social procedure" -&gt; "stifled contribution".  Perhaps it's worth acknowledging that another group would have taken the same text and formed a different social procedure that might not have stifled contributions.  In the end, though, I think the link between the game and those social procedures is pretty strong.<br/><br/>Giving someone advice on how to play their character doesn't <i>always</i> feel socially wrong to me; rather, it feels wrong in the social context of our intent to play AW specifically.

It's possible to design scenes where everyone has something to do but it can grow monotonous after a while (we're playing D&amp;D and of course were going to get into another fight since that is the scene type where we can all do something). It's like our friends keep ordering Thai because that's the only food we can all agree to eat. But constant Thai is boring even though it's safe. <br/><br/>By letting everyone go their own way, they have more freedom and choice. <br/><br/>So what I like to do is forget about scenes. Instead everyone takes turns like we were in combat. You get 2 minutes (customize to groups preference) then it's the next person's turn. The next person can be in a different place or even time and just because your turn is over doesn't mean your scene is. When we get back to you, you can continue from the same scene last turn. Except instead of going around in a circle, it's more freeform. Act in any order, but only act once till everyone does something. The key is to distribute spotlight evenly while keeping individual turns short. I've only recently started to master this.<br/><br/>I even do this in Mouse Guard with extended conflicts. After the 3 players in a conflict took their turns, while they re-script, I play out turns with the other players not in the conflict<br/><br/>I love Dogs in the Vineyard but this is connected to one of my only complaints. Conflicts use so many dice and so much physical space, it's difficult to run multiple concurrent conflicts and intercut between them. And there isn't a way to jump into a conflict that's already started.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_308291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308291/#Comment_308291" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T16:16:48+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  4:16PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2011 4:19PM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>But, as Montsegur suggests, it's not all mechanical.

That is; you speed things up, to make the players follow each other trough the short and intense scenes, and make the shifting focus happen at a speed that never lets them wind down during the game.

Some games, investigative ones in particular (e.g., Call/Trail of Cthulhu), pay off audience time as a player not in a scene in which info is revealed is itching to get to the point PC's are in same room again so they can legitimately "know" what they witnessed another find out and act on it (and being at table means you just say, "I tell him what we were told by sheriff" and the other player now can use the information).<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers also should be roleplaying and be interesting.  If you find watching another player do stuff for 5 minutes boring, how do you think the GM/DM/Keeper etc. feels?<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the same token play (let's assume GM) should be "cutting between scenes" and not focusing exclusively on one person for long stretches.  Ted's going to bathroom, let's focus on Mary for a bit.  I have a session coming up where 3 characters are doing 3 different things off on their own - one is doing an afternoon's research.  I will hand that player the handout with research for him to read, while I resolve the other two's scenes and I will cut between them at dramatic points (one scene starts with bang and then simmers to other stuff; the other starts with simmer and could be bang, each will shift to other at their transition point).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think of In a Wicked Age as a game where not everyone is in every scene but the story is developing and players not in scene should be paying attention and play should be engaging for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308319/#Comment_308319" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-14T18:51:21+00:00" title="January 14, 2011  6:51PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wonder about the people who say that "downtime" or "audience time" is a requirement for good, happy gaming...<br/><br/>How does that apply to the GM?

Fun to watch! Mostly this is good audience time.<br/><br/>I did not enjoy audience time in Shock:, a mix of Jenskot's thing about engineering bogus fiction to get everyone in the same room, combined with the fundamental structure of the game itself. Didn't play enough of this to know for sure if we just hadn't mastered the mechanics enough to move onto technique.<br/><br/>I really really do not enjoy audience time in any RPG that has a major tactical component, including Fight! scenes in BW. There is literally nothing at stake, emotionally speaking, for anyone observing the proceedings. Nonparticipants might kibbutz and comment and help the slow guys line up their numbers, but rarely if ever do I see them really rooting for one side or the other.<br/><br/>Audience time in AW is pretty good, mostly because the whole game runs like a slow-motion car wreck and nobody can turn away. Also there's not enough going on, tactically speaking, for that to become a distraction.<br/><br/>Dogs audience time was super-boring for reasons I can't put my finger on. Might be the dice-shuffling, which feels pretty intense as a player but doesn't look like much from the outside.<br/><br/>Nobody is an audience member in 3:16. Good thing since watching other guys blow away bugs by depleting a pool of points would be pretty boring. So, good design for avoiding audience time. Same with Mouse Guard and Agon and any other game that's explicitly team-oriented. Audience time in MG mostly happens during the player's turn and that can be sort of boring. Luckily it's typically quite short.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308369/#Comment_308369" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-15T10:44:59+00:00" title="January 15, 2011 10:44AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>It's possible to design scenes where everyone has something to do but it can grow monotonous after a while (we're playing D&amp;D and of course were going to get into another fight since that is the scene type where we can all do something).</blockquote>You're omitting the universal case where all the players have something fun to interact with: <b>each other</b>.  I agree that a bunch of specialist characters taking turns is crap.  A bunch of characters constantly proposing, vetting, and making <b>group decisions</b>, on the other hand, is great.  This is pretty much every session of Delve.\n<blockquote>You get 2 minutes (customize to groups preference) then it's the next person's turn. . . . Act in any order, but only act once till everyone does something. The key is to distribute spotlight evenly while keeping individual turns short. I've only recently started to master this.</blockquote>My AW GM is excellent at distributing the spotlight evenly (though one player now having two characters wrecked that somewhat), but perhaps the turns are a little long for my taste.  Each turn tends to last until the character makes a decision on the issue of the moment.  When the players are very decisive, this is almost never a problem.  But temporary indecision seems to be part of this group's DNA, so perhaps quicker cutting is required.  <br/><br/>I wonder what would happen if we cut when someone started to equivocate -- they might appreciate more time to think, but then thinking during the next person's turn rather than paying attention to them probably isn't ideal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308370/#Comment_308370" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-15T10:53:47+00:00" title="January 15, 2011 10:53AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave, how many people in this AW game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308372/#Comment_308372" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-15T10:56:09+00:00" title="January 15, 2011 10:56AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2011 11:05AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            4 players + GM.<br/><br/>If it was 3 players and 3 characters, I'd probably have much less frustration.<br/><br/>Not that I have a ton of frustration.

I find games with parallel, mostly non-intersecting stories tense because I am afraid of just that. It's unpleasant and not conducive to creativity.

It doesn't always work, naturally, but I guess that's why I prefer games with explicit player flags.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308436">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308436/#Comment_308436" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-16T11:30:12+00:00" title="January 16, 2011 11:30AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>I want to hear more about this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>A bunch of characters constantly proposing, vetting, and making<b>group decisions</b>, on the other hand, is great.  This is pretty much every session of Delve.</blockquote>\nOn the internet, it might look like I'm about to be a jerk, but you know me well enough (I hope) to understand that I'm just looking to further understanding.<br/><br/>So:<br/><br/>Are you sure? You're always the one GMing Delve, so your perspective might be skewed.<br/><br/>When I played Delve (which was very little), I remember quite a bit of "downtime". When a group of people are handling a challenging problem, especially one where we're "on the clock", it seems to stretch suspension of disbelief not to split up, delegate actions, etc. <br/><br/>So, for instance, when we were trying to open the "fire door", I'm pretty sure we had one person talking to the villagers, one running off to get a cauldron from the mayor's house (or whatever), another trying to scrawl a rune on it, etc. Even though you handled it very deftly, by fast-forwarding through moments and actions that were separate, the overall effect to me as a player is not entirely unlike turn-based combat: "Hey, I have an idea! I'm going to do this thing!" And then you wait for your turn to ask the GM if it worked. Until then, you're just listening to the others interact.<br/><br/>Group discussions about what to do can be interesting, but not all the time. Often, in my experience, two players (say) feel strongly about a certain decision, while the third and fourth couldn't care less, so they stay out of the discussion/argument/negotiation in hopes that it will wrap up soon. I often find myself in that position, and to me it feels very much like downtime (i.e. not being in the scene at all), except there's nothing interesting to watch/listen to/follow.<br/><br/>I've heard you write about that kind of thing a lot in your various writeups/APs (the "moon rock" example comes to mind, where players were debating what to do with the rock that becomes somewhat fluid under the moonlight), so I do think it happens. And my experience in that Mutants &amp; Masterminds game (in many/most ways very similar to Delve, including a very deliberate attempt to keep all the characters together all the time) was similar: action, powerful scenes, etc., took up a tiny fraction of play time, compared to group negotiation/discussion. I was timing various scenes, and I couldn't help noticing how "argument about what happened three sessions ago" or "discussion of how the Big Bad's plan will probably work" outweighed "climactic final confrontation" by a factor of nearly 10 to 1.<br/><br/>Single-characters-making-important-decisions allows "your turn" to feel really meaningful and decisive, which is also interesting to watch from an audience perspective: someone makes a strong decision, something happens! But you do lose the possibility of interacting with the scene fictionally, unless you have a very collaborative group or a system which allows you to take part in it somehow.<br/><br/>Overall, my gaming experience so far has been like John's:<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>What I find is<b>forcing the party to stay together creates more downtime</b>.</blockquote>\nThis is very true and a great insight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

With the more focused char-gen I'm using now, hopefully you would have been more primed to care about the mission -- getting to the core of the village's problem, to thwart it and/or steal its supernatural secrets (rather than helping redeem drunk NPCs or other tangetial crap).  With all the PCs on board for that, all you need are multiple plausible paths to follow and multiple plausible approaches to the tasks that arise.  It then becomes a collaborative effort to form the best approach to the one objective that everyone shares.  <b>No one wants to miss out on having input</b>, and <b>no one wants to absent a good mind from a decision</b>.  <br/><br/>So, the decision to dive is <i>shared</i>.  If you really want to, then everyone else <i>knows why</i>, and that's enough to elicit participation and anticipation.  If you don't really want to, then someone else comes up with a better idea, and you do that instead.  Or, if you're just covering bases, we fast forward and summarize.<br/><br/>Tasks that don't involve decisions get summarized in seconds.  Paul gets the water while Dan gets the log while Matt gets the village elder; done.<br/><br/>None of the preceding was hypothetical; it's all happened in the vast majority of my playtests.<br/><br/>Bad scenario design that leaves the players floundering with no idea what they might productively do will of course sabotage all of this.  But as long as the players have options and leads and motivation and know they can fast forward, it's all good.  (Questions, puzzles, and auguries help on the "leads" front.)<br/><br/><b>Separately:</b><br/>Good point about (a) intense time pressure + (b) multiple disparate tasks to try + (c) no need for strength in numbers.  That is flat terrible; sticking together makes no sense.  All I can say is that's the only time that particular thing has ever come up; I think I rushed through a ton of stuff because we abruptly realized players had to leave.  Normally, the phases go: (1) there are many things to do and plenty of time to do them in; (2) there's one urgent thing to do.  Sometimes urgency arrives before clarity, but then there's usually a survival reason to stick together.<br/><br/>That's a fair amount of particulars!  I'll readily admit, making constant PC interaction fun for the whole group the whole time isn't always a simple design spec!  But, y'know, switching from author to actor to audience can get complicated too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308504/#Comment_308504" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-17T07:00:59+00:00" title="January 17, 2011  7:00AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, Dave.<br/><br/>That makes sense to me, although it sounds like a lot to juggle!<br/><br/>Maybe I just have to see it in play sometime.

The players don't need to be hot shit actors to captivate me; I'm already looking to see the consequences of my earlier choices, and the set-up for my future ones.<br/><br/>My AW game often succeeds on this front, but I could always stand for the rate to be higher.  I tried to bump it up by appointing the other PCs as ministers in my character's new government.  That led to a few cool scenes, but ultimately wasn't appropriate to the cores of the characters, most of whom aren't particularly into giving or taking orders or social planning.  <br/><br/>In contrast, Jeff Colyer's PtA: Cold Sleep game <i>defines</i> the characters by issues which strongly intersect.  So, there's really nothing more important to the other characters than doing stuff that relates directly to mine.  Plus, we're the only people awake on our space ship.  Not sure how well either of those facts would play without the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308588/#Comment_308588" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-17T17:19:26+00:00" title="January 17, 2011  5:19PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 17, 2011 5:20PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>Uh, yeah!

I'm not sure why: perhaps because all the characters are connected. [...]<br/>But, as Montsegur suggests, it's not all mechanical. It's about caring about the other characters and wanting to watch their scenes. I don't know how you manufacture that.</blockquote>\nHmmm my tuppence would be that in Montsegur you can "steal" scenes from other players through the situation cards (no, I'm not sure if that's the right word...) so the game compels you into keep all your attention on every scene, should a situation arise where your character could make a dramatically appropriate entrance. Or at least so I think. By which I don't mean that it's a game which encourages stealing scenes for the sake of it. You're still working together to create a beautiful fiction. <br/>If I'm making sense, it would be a mechanical effect.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>this is a social issue, not a procedural one.

Practically, you<em>will</em>be as much as:<br/><br/>* You can stand it<br/>* The rules support it<br/>* Your social group allows it<br/><br/>It seems to me that listening to what''s going on is a minimum baseline, because what happens better have an ongoing impact you need to know about. If the game gives you further responsibilities or opportunities, there's that level of semi-mandatory engagement. And if you and your buddies enjoy endowment, lay-ons, adding color, jumping in with NPCs or whatever, that exists entirely outside the procedures and at the social contract level.</blockquote>\nAnd this is exactly why I love listening to Jason (or rather, reading his posts). This is one of the issues on which I'm most struggling while creating my game, and one I haven't made my mind about. It is especially important when you design a masterless game, I believe, because a GM could work like an orchestra director, balancing screen presence between characters, while in a masterless game, you have to design a way that ensures it mechanically.

By quickening the "scene turn-over" the game goes into a kind of <i>rich social synthesis</i>, a mood that all players/characters share in, while still keeping the individual story-lines. The result is something out of the ordinary, and fun.<br/><br/>Listening to what is going on, in scenes where your character is not participating, has great benefits to the group, the individual player, and the fiction, as long as you organize the game in ways that makes it interesting for the players to keep their attention on the interaction. Maintaining an all-encompassing positive interest for the game-play is important to the group dynamics, and to the flow of the fiction. Working with different tempo is one of the most effective tools I've seen, for supporting unbroken group-focus.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Suna</cite>a GM could work like an orchestra director, balancing screen presence between characters,</blockquote>Interesting! An orchestra conductor works with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tempo</span> all the time, but tempo is seldom mentioned in discussions on role-playing games. I believe it is key to much of the challenges regarding audience time. Most GM's, and most games, have no consciousness of tempo, and lacks the tools to work it effectively. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Suna</cite>balancing screen presence between characters, while in a masterless game, you have to design a way that ensures it mechanically</blockquote>Look to the game "Until we sink ..." by Magnus Jacobson for a way of doing it with a minimum of mechanical support.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308607/#Comment_308607" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-18T01:36:49+00:00" title="January 18, 2011  1:36AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 18, 2011 1:41AM by Suna.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas, thank you! That's a great advice, I'm going to delve into it. I think I have it. It's in Norwegian Style, right? Maybe I even played it once... can't remember though if it was that game.<br/><br/>I think we found an interesting, possibly crucial point with the tempo.<br/>On saturday I tested my game, Beyond the Mirror, playing in two. This time it was more a game than a playtest. The situation was in a mental hospital, my character and the other character have been face to face during the entire time. And it worked seamlessly despite the fact that the game does focus on a character at a time. It's designed to be like that, because each conflict deals with your memories as well as with the situation at hand, so it's important that it be focused on a character at a time. <br/><br/>However the mechanics worked well this time, despite the fact that you have to roll 1d6+3dFudge and then adjust your roll. Brief explanation: you can increase the result of your d6, but you have to decrease the roll of your dfudges, and vice versa. The d6 gives you your stake, while the dfudges keep your memory alive and vibrant (if you accumulate too many "-", you're not human, but machine). <br/>Didn't end up in downtime because the player wasn't busy doing the math but taking an ugly choice. "Do I care for the stake of this conflict or is it more important for me to be a human?" (it's the pivotal point of the entire game).<br/><br/>So there was no long wait, we kept our scenes short, despite the need to make a conflict per scene. <br/>That's why I decided to keep mine as a game for 2-4 players, recommending that it be played in 3.<br/>From this rhythm -the game's structure- tempo comes balanced by itself, more or less. Of course it still depends on players, but well, that's true with any game. Maybe tempo hasn't been explicitly taken into account in discussions.<br/>But here I see it mentioned as a possible downtime issue, and the idea strikes me as very interesting because I never considered it. Of course, coming from boardgames, the term refers to math and math only. But in rpg, it totally makes sense to consider a "narrative downtime" as when inactive time for a single player becomes too long...<br/><br/>I'm glad I suggested this topic with my previous discussion <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_308609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308609/#Comment_308609" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-18T01:41:16+00:00" title="January 18, 2011  1:41AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Suna</cite>Of course it still depends on players, but well, that's true with any game.</blockquote>It is, up to the point where you help the players by giving them good advice and functional tools. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308611/#Comment_308611" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-18T01:48:45+00:00" title="January 18, 2011  1:48AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: Suna</cite>Of course it still depends on players, but well, that's true with any game.</blockquote>It is, up to the point where you help the players by giving them good advice and functional tools. ;-)<br/><br/>Absolutely, let us asseverate that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_308614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308614/#Comment_308614" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-18T02:02:00+00:00" title="January 18, 2011  2:02AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Asseverate"! <br/><br/>A new word for me.

So I propose you would keep playing out the scene, and see what it led to. Go with the flow!<br/><br/>But; the reality is that most scenes are played too long, with the overall engagement dwindling as a result. Role-players are "experts" at killing the pace of the game, often supported by game-methods too slow and cumbersome for their own good. I am not in love with all that happens in modern rpgs, but most of them are certainly more agile than games of old. They give the game-play a pace that is far more lively and entertaining.<br/><br/>Having games of higher tempo and more effective storytelling, with scenes and character-focus shifting more often, rids us of some of the problems connected to audience time too.

Like Graham said, the best scenes are focused between two characters. If you throw in a sideline character and really play them (from your own perspective) as a fully three-dimensional character, maybe giving them the same thought you'd give your own protagonist (with a lot more improvised, of course), I think you'll have a lot more fun.<br/><br/>If that's not something you want to do, then yeah, being an audience member can suck. I must admit, it depends on the genre for me. I'm much less willing to be a bystander in a game like Fiasco (where the main players are absolutely larger-than-life fuck-ups) than in a game like Shock:, where everyone can be unique just by virtue of the constructed setting. I guess it depends on the playset for Fiasco, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308726/#Comment_308726" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-19T06:50:32+00:00" title="January 19, 2011  6:50AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2011 6:51AM by JDCorley.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>Well, if everyone is really into the scene, no one is really left out, are they?</blockquote>\nRight, but there's no way for me to say that this audience time is good, and this other audience time is bad, or the ways I have to say it are kinda crude (fan mail) or disruptive (interrupting and saying something.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308734/#Comment_308734" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-19T08:38:41+00:00" title="January 19, 2011  8:38AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2011 8:39AM by Suna.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>Well, if everyone is really into the scene, no one is really left out, are they?</blockquote>\nRight, but there's no way for me to say that this audience time is good, and this other audience time is bad, or the ways I have to say it are kinda crude (fan mail) or disruptive (interrupting and saying something.)<br/><br/>And that is what I am currently smashing my head on the wall about, hoping to find a solution for my game. My only one, right now, is: "if you have a game whose focus is on characters' intimate psichology, it makes sense to have one spotlight character at a time. So the best solution seems to be eliminating audience and make the rest of the players gather together in order to form the opposition". Sort of a la Dirty Secrets.<br/><br/>No, it's not that by being active opposition they cease to be audience. Mind you, the Master of Ceremony in Apocalypse World is a form of audience. He basically asks questions and is the fan of the players. So the role's boundaries aren't as defined as one thinks. When you have a collective opposition, sooner or later, as a natural process, they will select a speaker amongst them. And he'll be the one rolling the dice (generally speaking).<br/>Which might be an interesting point to put forward, possibly, in the current discussion.<br/><br/>Are we sure that audience is audience? <br/>Take the two examples above.<br/><br/>Speaking to all participants to this thread: what is your definition of this word, "audience"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308747/#Comment_308747" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-19T09:54:51+00:00" title="January 19, 2011  9:54AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, one possible (strict) definition for "audience time" is when:<br/><br/>a) play is ongoing,<br/>b) you have no narrational responsibilities in the current scene/moment (e.g. speaking lines for a character, resolving/narrating outcomes, describing scenery), and<br/>c) you have no ability to affect the game-state mechanically (e.g. rolling dice, dispensing bonuses and penalties, making rulings).<br/><br/>Parts b) and c), combined, suggest that there would be no effect on gameplay if you were simply not present at the table.<br/><br/>The strictest definition, would, of course, be:<br/><br/>You (the player) may not speak until this scene/moment is over.<br/><br/>You're absolutely right, though, that the examples we're talking about (and real life) blur all these categories. For instance, mechanics like Fan Mail and the customary dispensing of experience points at the end of, say, a Vampire session arguably don't impact the game mechanically in that very instant, but rather over the long term.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308760/#Comment_308760" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-19T10:53:25+00:00" title="January 19, 2011 10:53AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2011 10:54AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say that "playing" for me is pretty much either playing a character in the scene or being a GM (who is frequently, but not always, playing a character in the scene).  If the system offers me other things I can do to affect things when I'm not in the scene -- fan mail or whatever -- that's great, but it's not as great as playing a character in the scene.  Being able to distribute fanmail or contribute mechanically to someone else's scenes would not be enough to get me to play the game if I never got to play a character of my own, in other words.  That stuff is "audience time" to me: I may be given the chance to contribute something to the scene, but I'm not <i>in</i> the scene.  I'm not getting to do the really fun part, I'm watching other people do it.<br/><br/>My goal at the table as a player is to enjoy the hell out of every scene I play a character in, and to use the rest of the time to appreciate what other people are doing in the scenes I'm not in, to rest/recharge my batteries and plan out what I'm doing next, to think about the story so far (where it's going, where I'd like it to go), and so on.  Which is why I don't hate audience time: it's something I need to make the time I spend playing better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_308768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308768/#Comment_308768" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-19T12:00:01+00:00" title="January 19, 2011 12:00PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 19, 2011 12:00PM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>Well, if everyone is really into the scene, no one is really left out, are they?</blockquote>Right, but there's no way for me to say that this audience time is good, and this other audience time is bad,...Well, I tend to spot it, when a player left outside the scene is bored.

All else being equal I'd rather play than GM any day, but once in a very long while I want to have GM-fun instead, which means that instead of wanting to have fun playing a character myself, I want to have fun playing multiple NPCs, playing the world, and being the referee for other people's characters.  When I GM a game, I'm coming at it with the mindset that I want to have fun doing something <i>other</i> than playing, in other words.<br/><br/>But I actually love it when the players are just bantering in-character with each other and I'm not called upon to do anything, for the same reason that I sometimes enjoy just watching other people play out a scene:  it entertains me and it gives me a break from being "on."  I can update my notes, get my ideas into better shape (and steal their best ideas to build off of in later scenes), all without making them wait for me.  Plus, it's a kick when the players are THAT excited about their characters!<br/><br/>It's still not quite as much fun for me as playing an NPC in a scene with them.  Likewise, just adjudicating things isn't as much fun for me as playing an NPC in a scene with them.  It's not awful -- it hits a few smaller sweet spots, like the joy of doing a job well, the pleasure of making other people happy, and the thrill of being the expert everyone consults -- and as I said, I really do <i>need</i> to have breaks from playing a character for me to fully enjoy myself, so I absolutely don't resent those scenes where I'm not playing one.  It's just that those aren't the main draw for me in gaming, they're not the things that make me want to sit down at the table and they're not what I think of when I think "playing this game (or GMing this game) is so much fun."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308803/#Comment_308803" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-19T16:34:08+00:00" title="January 19, 2011  4:34PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>I believe players will communicate their boredom in efficient ways, through the means I've talked about above; face, body and mouth.

And my character was even present in the scene! It was just as if... well as if she wasn't. She was an Unicorn clan in a situation where her skills (i.e. horseriding) were perfectly useless, and could do nothing but sit and wait for the Crane and the Dragon characters to solve the situation.

When you're the Unicorn Rider (or whatever), and the scene has gone on for 40 minutes, a game system which gives your character powerful agency (even if it great price) makes it much more likely that, as a player, you can step in and do something. In a "traditional" task resolution situation, however, it's often the case that if you don't have the right skill, you're better off sitting out of the situation completely.<br/><br/>I've never seen play bog down to the same extent when every player has enough agency to shake up the situation, to step in and say, "Ok, that's it. I'm taking this guy down/breaking down the door/seducing her, and I'm willing to spend all my Pool points and burn off this relationship to do it/I'm escalating this "negotiation" to Fighting..."<br/><br/>I had a funny experience with this the last time I played Apocalypse World: that same feeling I used to have in "trad" games, where you know your character is helpless in a certain situation because s/he doesn't have the right skills, and therefore the smartest and safest move is to sit still and just wait for the other characters to do something about the situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Suna" title="Suna"><img alt="Suna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Suna">Suna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308837/#Comment_308837" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-20T07:36:51+00:00" title="January 20, 2011  7:36AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Paul, <br/>of course, and you don't even need to tell me, traditional games suffer from the "mommy may I...?" complex. That is. You always have to ask the GM to do what you would like to do. And no guarantee is given that your character will ever matter in the situation at hand.<br/><br/>That such a thing happens in AW is something I have never experienced. Could you please further explain? Possibly opening a new thread? I think the topic is worth some in-depth analysis, if you agree with me. It happened to me that my driver was in a situation where she would have been facing the group's hardholder and his gang, and had no chances to win the conflict. That happened while the hardholder was burying our brainer kid alive! <br/>I was afraid for my character. Impala (the driver) wanted to save Lively (the brainer), but couldn't move a finger for fear of being shot down (she was already wounded, to 6 o'clock). I could almost feel Impala blaming herself for being a coward, unable to do what was right to do in order to save a person she loved. <br/>In the end, when she managed to save him by kidnapping the hardholder's lover, and afterwards she and the brainer met again, she hug him and wept telling him how sorry she was for her cowardice, begging for his forgiveness, while he couldn't understand why she felt sorry or she would need his forgiveness.<br/>Situation similar to what you just described, but it ended up becoming a <i>very</i> intense situation and we all enjoyed it very much. To be honest, one of the best scenes in the entire game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308841/#Comment_308841" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-20T08:12:35+00:00" title="January 20, 2011  8:12AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Suna,<br/><br/>It's not all that complicated, and, as you describe, it can lead to good drama. As far as I can see, the "traditional" setup, and the way moves work in AW is very similar, does not give the player any way to manipulate their characters' odds by, for example, choosing to lose or fail. When your character is helpless in a situation, you as the player are similarly helpless. Your only choices are to roll the dice and take your chances or to sit and wait.<br/><br/>The way AW moves are formulated certainly helps remove the "Mommy may I" factor, because their scope is fairly well established. But beyond that, how were the repercussions of your AW scene any different than they would have been in a "traditional" game? That sounds like drama that was well handled by you and the group, and I don't really see how it would have been terribly different if you were playing, say, AD&amp;D. Your combined skill in handling the situation and infusing it with meaning made it powerful and interesting. (Without your confession of cowardice, for example, there would not have been as much drama.)<br/><br/>(If you'd like to discuss this further, please do begin a new thread, of course!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_308847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308847/#Comment_308847" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-20T09:41:45+00:00" title="January 20, 2011  9:41AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2011 9:44AM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My take on this "problem" is to help players out of action-focus, and into character-focus.<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>When your character is helpless in a situation, you as the player are similarly helpless.</blockquote>Not quite right.

That's where the leverage of a certain type of conflict resolution, which gives the player more power to push things around--or even just the ability to "take it to the dice"--can help a group break out of a "stalled" situation in-game.<br/><br/>What you just wrote is fantastic advice, however.

I'd rather work on making better situations as opposed to introducing conflict resolution mechanics.</blockquote>\nI absolutely agree that close identification with the character, making the character's resources and the player's resources similar to each other, etc, are powerful tools for immersion, drama, etc. When you play a deadly "traditional" game that doesn't pull its punches, for example, you might experience real belly-churning fear for your character's life!<br/><br/>My only point in the last part of this thread is that conflict resolution mechanics which give the players strong agency over the flow of the game are *very* effective at preventing or solving a lot of these issues. Most of the unhappy gaming I've seen (and taken part in) has, at its root, a style and System of play (in the Lumpley sense) that limits the players' ability to impact on the flow of the game. Give those players the tools to shake things up and fight for what they want, and, assuming they understand that those toys really work, things change very dramatically. For many players, it's a rapid shift from un-fun to very much fun, indeed. (For several people I know, it's made the difference from "I'll never play RPGs again, have outgrown them in the last five years, no longer my thing, I guess," to "When's the next game?")<br/><br/>In an ideal world, I agree that these procedures may be a "crutch". I'd rather have pure roleplay and better situation design solve these issues than metagame resource management and that kind of thing, as you mention. But I haven't yet seen such strong situation design that it accomplishes this consistently, even for "less skilled" players. So, as far as I am concerned: If I can have fun consistently while gaming, I'll take this sort of "crutch" very happily, and wave it around all night! <br/><br/>In the meantime, of course, I'll be keeping an eye on the horizon for better techniques, tools, and tricks to come.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308901/#Comment_308901" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T00:01:37+00:00" title="January 21, 2011 12:01AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey!  I think I can bring this back to the thread topic!<br/><br/>So, <b>levels of satisfaction in an Audience role</b> might go something like this:<br/>None - no ability to affect flow, not invested in fiction<br/>Low - no ability to affect flow, initially invested in fiction but that wanes<br/>Medium - ability to affect flow, but weak or waning investment in fiction<br/>High - no ability to affect flow, utterly captivated by fiction<br/>Ultra - ability to affect flow, utterly captivated by fiction<br/><br/>I'm fine with striving for ultra-satisfaction, but see no great value in medium satsifaction.  When I'm audience in Land of Nodd, I love that I can end scenes or call for resolutions.  But that wouldn't be enough without the initial set-up where we agree to play situations I enjoy.<br/><br/>My only point here is that you can't get around the need to generate situations that grab the whole group.  Games that don't provide for that make me sad.  Expecting a resolution mechanic to make up for that lack is no wiser than expecting a magical GM to just make it happen.<br/><br/>This is why I prefer a game of Grey Ranks or Montsegur, where everyone's dealing with their relationships to each other and their place in the overall shared seige/war, to a PtA game where the PCs' issues are unrelated.                        </div>\n<div

preference is for the Audience to feel highly satisfied in their role without taking away from whoever has spotlight at the moment. And I don't want high audience participation to mean no one ever really has spotlight. <br/><br/>Mouse Guard does this ok. You need the other players, you need their helping dice and variety of skills to survive most situations. So even in the Player's Turn (after the mission is over), players will often bring other players with them on their individual scenes (even though they don't have to) so that they can increase their chances of success. You 100% need each other (because of the basic math behind resolution) which quickly creates a sense of camaraderie. <br/><br/>Trail of Cthulhu achieves a similar effect by spreading the required skills evenly among the players. You need someone who can unravel the core clue to be with you but to get more, to understand what the clues mean, you need different skills owned by the other players. The distribution of skills make it so that spotlight is passed around AND even when it isn't your spotlight, you need to pay attention and be proactive to fill in the missing pieces the spotlight character isn't equipped to explore.<br/><br/>D&amp;D 4E handles this with role distribution for combat and skill training distribution for non-combat scenes. <br/><br/>In Trail and D&amp;D 4E, it's like you're team is collectively VOLTRON... but you've been split into seperate parts. You're simultaneously individuals made up of broken pieces from a larger whole AND together 1 super character. It's like taking SUPERMAN and tearing him apart to form a superhero team.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308922/#Comment_308922" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T07:26:25+00:00" title="January 21, 2011  7:26AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2011 7:36AM by jenskot.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Although I enjoy the above, what I really love, is when for emotional reasons (not mathematical, although I can get emotionally charged over math) the players are so engaged that even as an audience member, they feel captivated. <br/><br/>This weekend my nonprofit organized a 180 person 2 day gaming event. It far surpassed my expectations. But was especially joyous because even though I was constantly besieged by text messages of issues that needed attending or resolution, I was able to run 4 RPGs. 2 Mouse Guard games and 2 Dogs in the Vineyard games. One Dogs game I ran was one of my favorite games ever (at least it felt that way) and was partially due to how engaged the players were when they were audience members.<br/><br/>The game itself felt high stakes for me. Even though my voice was almost gone, I poured everything I could into it. 3 of the players were young (around 21) and only dabble in RPGs but mainly play World of Warcraft. The group itself had a mix of male and female players, all non-white, and most new to our events so I wanted to make an impression. <br/><br/>I\u2019ve run Dogs over 100 times for over 200 different people. I\u2019ve made a few hacks along the way (I love it out of the box) but the changes that are relevant to this thread\u2026<br/><br/>1. A Short Term Fallout option is that you are Alone and in Trouble. Dogs players have a tendency to stick together which I find very boring and mechanically if you have 4 Dogs in every conflict, Dogs win with minimal fuss unless it is against a mob. I also want to give the NPCs a chance to influence Dogs and build empathy which is difficult with a group and easy with 1-2 people. And if different Dogs empathize with different people, the Dogs themselves conflict and the game is almost always better for it.<br/><br/>2. You don\u2019t makeup NPCs. Instead I provide a list of all the major NPCs in the town with a picture, name, role, and 3 word description. Players are encouraged to choose at least 3, and 2 must be shared. Extra Relationship dice may be left unassigned as normal. <br/><br/>I tell the players to go crazy with the relationships. You can decide Nathaniel is your dad, killed your dad, your dad\u2019s boss, your boss, pushed you to sin, you saved him from sin, you tried to kill him but he got away, he saved your life\u2026 almost anything. Then I walk away from the table. I give them 10 minutes alone. I find this makes them feel more free to be creative and don\u2019t keep looking to me for approval. Instead they go nuts, and they almost always do. And since 2 relationships have to be shared, they all discuss these connections together. <br/><br/>When I come back, every player is 10 times more invested in the game and they haven\u2019t even started \u201cplaying\u201d yet. And because they all are coming at the NPCs from different perspectives\u2026 they all want to know how someone else\u2019s relationships conflicts or confirms theirs in play. Dogs helps with this process because towns are small, isolated, and most people are related somehow. So it is easy to suspend disbelief that it would end up being so soap opera like.<br/><br/>Then in play, even when players weren\u2019t in the scene, they paid attention to every detail. They wanted to know if their old instructor really did it and what that says about their own relationship that they chose themselves. Everything is connected to reveals or consequences in any scene will come back to you. So you have a reason to care! And because towns are small, it\u2019s trivial to reunite, resplit, and then reunite the PCs again at any moment at any place. Bob just revealed who gave him the alternate edition of the book of life\u2026 everyone wants to be there\u2026 bam\u2026 no problem\u2026 you\u2019re there. It\u2019s the best of both worlds. They can be individuals and then when it is convenient they can be together.<br/><br/>And meta never came into it. Knowing an NPC just revealed something and wanting to be there to see the consequences is meta, your character doesn\u2019t know that but the people playing don\u2019t know what meta is, don\u2019t think about it, and don\u2019t care. And they were super immersed in their characters. These were people mainly new to RPGs. In character creation, they asked which \u201cBackground\u201d in Dogs in the Vineyard is the \u201cBrick\u201d and which is the \u201cDPS\u201d (damage per second, see World of Warcraft). But in play you would think they had been roleplaying for years. <br/><br/>Dogs has the problem that you can\u2019t join a conflict once it is started which can be a drag and contradicts much of what I described above. I use some rule variants from Afraid, the never published horror version of Dogs, but the join mid-conflict rules have been clunky. What I do now is let the players help with their traits, relationships or belongings. But they can\u2019t use them again in the next conflict. Simple but it seemed to work really well. And emotionally was satisfying to the players on the outside wanting to join in. <br/><br/>Next time I\u2019m going to include the Town\u2019s Sins on the list of NPCs at the start of the game and see how that works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308933/#Comment_308933" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T08:46:09+00:00" title="January 21, 2011  8:46AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>I like that! It's probably not the only way to construct that chart, but it makes sense to me.<br/><br/>Question about "creating situation":<br/><br/>So, I agree that we need to start with something that everyone is engaged with, and as much as possible. I am planning to put together an Apocalypse World "one-shot" (probably really two or three session) and I plan to try a technique for building a web of relationships not unlike what John is describing for his Dogs game. When I've done this kind of thing in a way that engages the players, the effect is fantastic, pretty much every time. In my Lady Blackbird hack, I let the players make a few simple choices, like "which of these NPCs is a cannibal? Which is known for his or her sense of honour?" And they love it; it seems to really increase their investment in the NPCs.<br/><br/>The conflict resolution issue, though, to my mind, is not about this. Yes, we need to create an engaging situation for play, and especially for audience interest. However, once play begins, engagement depends on the situation remaining interesting as it changes and takes new forms. This is where, in many "classical/traditional" styles of gaming, player input disappears entirely. I find that conflict resolution tools, such as present in a lot of modern games, make that whole process of one situation transforming into another a much more democratic process, which helps maintain and build further engagement.<br/><br/>So, maybe while throwing some points in to help someone win a conflict isn't terribly engaging fictionally, having that impact on the story helps the player have a say in what kind of <i>new</i> situation they're interested in?

I remember talking about this kind of NPC/relationship creation tool together back at NerdNYC (probably before we met), and I think it's become a big part of both our respective gaming toolboxes!<br/><br/>I'm curious to hear more:<br/><br/>First, the NPC relationship-creation business! Do you find that your players, left alone, tend to come up with juicy relationships? I'd be worried about them, say, all deciding together, "OK, how about we all like this NPC a whole lot, but that one over there, let's all have trouble with them, OK?" Does that kind of thing happen? If not, why do you think it doesn't?<br/><br/>Or do you let them do that, and then try to overthrow their expectations in play, by showing unexpectedly good and bad sides of certain NPCs?<br/><br/>I like the idea of listing the Town's Sins on the NPC sheet, since it might influence the players' ideas of what relationships they might form to the various NPCs.<br/><br/>I can see two versions of this:<br/><br/>1. You list all the NPCs, and then say what each one has done. "Brother Jeremiah, old farmer. He stole money from the Town's doctor." I'm not sure how much motivation you'd want to include. Are these rumours, or solid facts? The players can then spend those 10 minutes wondering who was at fault, and whether the theft was justified, and taking sides in the conflicts they already know about before play even begins.<br/><br/>2. You list all the NPCs, and say, "These are people you know in the Town." Then say, "Here's what you've heard has happened in the Town: Someone has been stoned to death for adultery, and an important member of the community is on trial, with half the Town hoping to force them to leave for good." In this case, the sins/crimes are not yet attached to specific people, leaving more to be discovered in the first few scenes of the session. Players can choose their relationships while wondering which of the people they used to know are now in trouble, or are now sinners.<br/><br/>How would/did you do it?<br/><br/>This whole thing is giving me an idea for a Town Playset (a la Fiasco), for no-prep Dogs play, but I'll think about it first and post later!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308939/#Comment_308939" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T09:01:48+00:00" title="January 21, 2011  9:01AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Second, tell us more about "using Traits to help". Did it have an effect on audience engagement, or the feel of a more democratic unfolding of situation?<br/><br/>I like the way it allows players to engage in conflicts, but with a risk attached ("Are you willing to risk entering the next conflict without your gun to help now?"). It seems like it would feel pretty disconnected from the fiction sometimes, though.

John's Dogs game is a perfect example, and I think this is the key:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>because they all are coming at the NPCs from different perspectives\u2026 they all want to know how someone else\u2019s relationships conflicts or confirms theirs in play.</blockquote>Once you have that, audience time is about as well-primed to dig the fiction as it can be.<br/><br/>Paul, great point that setting up a fun starting situation is not the same as maintaining fun situations throughout a long game.  I guess I should have been more specific.  When I think "creating situation" in the broad, game design or GM prep sense, I'm thinking of situation batteries that charge play over the length of play.  <br/><br/>I'm not thinking of "The monster advances while the puzzle door counts down while your brother reproaches your childhood abuse; what do you do?!"  Rather, I'm thinking of, "We all want some combos of fame, fear, wealth, status, and magical power, in a town that affords us conflicting options for all of the above and for survival."  That town + those characters should be a source of fun situations just by virtue of in-fiction choices and actions, without any need for direct story-wrangling.<br/><br/>For example, I'd be happy to play the Dogs town John just described using <i>any</i> resolution system.  Make me a GURPS sheet where my stat ranks go Firearms &gt; Melee &gt; Negotiation, and I'm good to go.<br/><br/>Of course, if making situation batteries as good as that town was always easy, the indie games we all love might never have been born...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>So, maybe while throwing some points in to help someone win a conflict isn't terribly engaging fictionally, having that impact on the story helps the player have a say in what kind of <i>new</i> situation they're interested in?

I still need to dig the fiction (and would like to play my character), though.

And the rules where you get to keep dice for later if you give up really guided players to take losses in meaningful ways (especially when I increased the dice you keep to 2 instead of 1). And escalation was glorious. Players had to decide... do I commit a horrible violent act to win or do what I think is right but lose what I want?

The GM, being human, can easily misread the players' interest in advancing quickly through story vs. lingering on an existing conflict, or just use his or her own preferences to override those of the players. All these things can lead to boredom on the behalf of the players. <br/><br/>(I think this is maybe why you developed the pacing dial for Delve, so you don't have to guess and read them.)<br/><br/>Up-front conflict resolution methods help us, as a group, get on the same page about the desired pace of play and help the group overall come to a decision on how that all happens.<br/><br/>A great Dogs Town + a set of rules that make it really hard for anyone to actually enact any change in the situation = at least one bored person at the table, all else being equal. I'd go as far as to say that those games/groups where it <i>doesn't</i> should be mined for the specific tools and techniques they are using to keep up interest and tempo.<br/><br/>In Delve's case, how important is the pacing dial at this level? I know you say you tend to use it less and less over time... is that your group developing those tools and learning about each other's preferences as you go along?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308988/#Comment_308988" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T15:12:15+00:00" title="January 21, 2011  3:12PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Paul, I love all these questions but I wanted to restrain myself before answering as I feel it may derail the topic at hand. I can always answers these in email or another thread.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>John,<br/><br/>I'm always excited to hear about your gaming experiences, and this one sounds like it was even more awesome than usual. I remember talking about this kind of NPC/relationship creation tool together back at NerdNYC (probably before we met), and I think it's become a big part of both our respective gaming toolboxes!<br/><br/>I'm curious to hear more:<br/><br/>First, the NPC relationship-creation business! Do you find that your players, left alone, tend to come up with juicy relationships? I'd be worried about them, say, all deciding together, "OK, how about we all like this NPC a whole lot, but that one over there, let's all have trouble with them, OK?" Does that kind of thing happen? If not, why do you think it doesn't?<br/><br/>Or do you let them do that, and then try to overthrow their expectations in play, by showing unexpectedly good and bad sides of certain NPCs?<br/><br/>I like the idea of listing the Town's Sins on the NPC sheet, since it might influence the players' ideas of what relationships they might form to the various NPCs.<br/><br/>I can see two versions of this:<br/><br/>1. You list all the NPCs, and then say what each one has done. "Brother Jeremiah, old farmer. He stole money from the Town's doctor." I'm not sure how much motivation you'd want to include. Are these rumours, or solid facts? The players can then spend those 10 minutes wondering who was at fault, and whether the theft was justified, and taking sides in the conflicts they already know about before play even begins.<br/><br/>2. You list all the NPCs, and say, "These are people you know in the Town." Then say, "Here's what you've heard has happened in the Town: Someone has been stoned to death for adultery, and an important member of the community is on trial, with half the Town hoping to force them to leave for good." In this case, the sins/crimes are not yet attached to specific people, leaving more to be discovered in the first few scenes of the session. Players can choose their relationships while wondering which of the people they used to know are now in trouble, or are now sinners.<br/><br/>How would/did you do it?<br/><br/>This whole thing is giving me an idea for a Town Playset (a la Fiasco), for no-prep Dogs play, but I'll think about it first and post later!</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308989/#Comment_308989" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T15:36:01+00:00" title="January 21, 2011  3:36PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This just seems to be solving a symptom of the problem. Of course big conflict-based scenes run the risk of isolating the less involved players. So we want to democratize those scenes by eliminating the GM as conflict resolver, throw mechanical (fanmail) or narrative (relationships) links to the less involved players, and blame the social context when those things aren't enough.<br/><br/>But at least one alternative solution is to break up the big conflict-based scenes and let the action of the characters be as flexible as the players want. This seems to be scary because of a desire to preserve some great moments where a few players have an entire scene all to themselves and did something spectacular. But I, for one, don't see how a truly enjoyable scene for audience and player is put at risk by letting the players themselves decide if it should be given the entire stage.<br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308990/#Comment_308990" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T15:46:59+00:00" title="January 21, 2011  3:46PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2011 3:50PM by jenskot.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel, could you give us examples of the alternative solution you mentioned above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309035/#Comment_309035" name="Item_113" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-21T22:44:36+00:00" title="January 21, 2011 10:44PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>In Delve's case, how important is the pacing dial at this level?

The dial is a tool to avoid or end boredom.  If there's no boredom, it's not needed.  <br/><br/>My Recess group actually did an extremely good job of anticipating boring stuff and cranking up the dial to avoid playing it.  One guy in particular, I think, was on the lookout for bad stuff from his prior play experiences, which he helped obviate.<br/><br/>The part of a given conflict resolution mechanic that says "now might be a good time to think about pacing" strikes me as similar.

This is especially true for the old classical games (D&amp;D, Warhammer, and the likes), which are buggered down by slow resolutions systems, and give little support to flexible and fast game-play. So; if lots of your game-sessions are sliding towards boredom, and you find it hard to follow advise on how to change it, a new game-system may be the solution. You may need a system light enough to support rapid scene-shifts, shorter and more action packed scenes, and diversity in conflicts and relationships. And it would be preferable, of course, for such a light system to deliver the same amount of crunch too.<br/><br/>As for modern games; boredom is rare, and when it occurs I believe it has more to do with the overall engagement produced by the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_309070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309070/#Comment_309070" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-22T07:08:59+00:00" title="January 22, 2011  7:08AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>Apocalypse World is a serviceable example, it has a clear task resolution system which allows us to break up the action between different times and places. The only real issue is if the MC imposes a rigid scene structure on top of the game and then the players don't break that up by asking questions. So whether it plays that way may be highly dependent on the dynamics of the group.<br/><br/>As far as other games, <a href="http://wyrmwood.mmo-report.com/playtest/HomeworldProj.pdf" rel="nofollow">Homeworld Project</a> is a game I've been playing for years that is an ideal example, because that was one of my design goals for it. Players have tremendous control of when they want to be involved and when they don't. You can sit back and enjoy hours of game play without needing to be involved (or being absent if it comes to that), while still having your character(s) tied to what is going on. Likewise, when you want part of the action, you can join in, without stepping on the other player's toes. <br/><br/>The result is you can take your breathers when you are tired, step back when you want to give someone else more of the stage, step in when you want to add something more. All in all, it is an entirely different thing than getting all your audience fix stuff when the game or GM tells you to, and not getting it when you are supposed to be on. <br/><br/>And I have to say it is incredibly freeing to not be stuck playing stories fit in a linear sequence of scenes with their free play / conflict play rhythm. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_309106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/309106/#Comment_309106" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-22T10:48:17+00:00" title="January 22, 2011 10:48AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2011 10:56AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel, Homeworld Project looks extremely cool!
