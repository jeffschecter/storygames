I was saying "yes, more of that please", because explicitly saying "look, this can be frustrating, but here's some thing(s) you can try that will help you" makes it absolutely clear that it's not necessarily your fault if you don't grasp every part of the rules instantly and have brilliant contributions immediately.  That's completely great and all games should do that, forever, the end, anyone who argues is wrong.<br/><br/>So I was reading my Smallville RPG PDF, in preparation for an upcoming game set in what I have insouciantly called "The Marvel Movie Trailer-verse" ("If they didn't think it was important enough to get it across in a three minute trailer, you don't have to know about it."), and I came across page 73.  <br/><br/>A quick precis of the Smallville system. You roll a bunch of dice and keep the highest two, adding them together. You are guaranteed to be rolling at least two dice because you're always rolling at least a Value (Duty, Power, Glory, etc.) and a Relationship.  You may have some bonuses or abilities or whatnot that allow you to roll more dice in certain situations, but you're always rolling those two.<br/><br/>Then on page 73, it says this (edited slightly for brevity):<br/><br/>"If a Lead player starts having trouble picking an appropriate Relationship to roll, that's...a signal that the player doesn't know why what's happening matters to his character.  All Watchtower needs to do is drop in a line of dialogue from a Feature or a scrap of evidence that points the way to who he's fighting with...or for. But it's not all on Watchtower to make things work; a little dialogue or exposition from a Lead can make a die roll all about living up to a friend's expectations or proving that a rival's accusations aren't true.<br/><br/>If a Lead's Values aren't applying to a situation, why is he in that situation?...the story shouldn't be about things the Lead doesn't care about.  Watchtower can...bring events back into line with, or perhaps directly challenging, the Lead's Values.  The Lead player can start looking for ways to make the episode's events relate to what his character is all about."<br/><br/>(stands on chair) YES!  YEEESSSS!<br/><br/>I was psyched as hell to read that, and I'm reading it out loud to eeeeeveryone I teach this game to.<br/><br/>Okay, so I have a question though.<br/><br/>Looking at the lifePathways thing, it looks like if I'm born Rich or Strange, then I increase a Resource by 1 in that step, but the only Resource I am able to have at that point is the Extra which I drew in in this step, right?  So I draw a circle, write "Pepper Potts" in it, draw an arrow and write "childhood pal" on it, and write down "Pepper Potts (<i>Socialize, Business</i>): 2d4 on my sheet. Then I immediately cross that off and write 2d6 instead. I don't have any other Resources to increase at that point. Right?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291597/#Comment_291597" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-04T19:26:57+00:00" title="September  4, 2010  7:26PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I'm only here to nod my head in agreement with the "YESSsssss" bit: We played a one-shot (basically one of the con scenarios that MWP put together for GenCon, basically involving the Green Arrow Crew), and the relationships were boiling off of their pages. They were the most interesting things about the other characters.<br/><br/>And more than that: Since each character had a relationship with each and every other character, reading the relationships aloud was like... hmmm.. Ah, got it: Like you know when you read the WoD Vampire/Werewolf/Other and they basically give a one-page callout to a clan, and then are like "Here's what we think about the other clans": And some of the descriptions are buddy-buddy, and some are full of venom, and it's really interesting to see how everyone thinks about everyone else? Yeah, it had that Big Time. Pretty cool.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, when we played our one-shot it was without the R-map creation part, so I can't help you there. We're planning on a long campaign (likely based on X-Men) where we will do that stuff, so I'll follow for a reply.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291605/#Comment_291605" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-04T22:02:55+00:00" title="September  4, 2010 10:02PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Jason!<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, that's an example of Josh Roby's excellent writing, which he brought to the book (and for which he deserves major praise).

I really like the "how to run the game" advice, especially everything in the Scenes chapter (scene framing and telegraphic deserve special acknowledgment for their usefulness). <br/><br/>I'm very curious to see how it works in play, the 9th season characters seemed like they had a lot to keep track of but then again... playing them might be like starting a game with a 20th level D&amp;D character. Starting from 1st level and working your way up makes keeping track of everything easier. The same is probably true if you start with a season 1 character. <br/><br/>Does anyone know if there is a flow chart breaking down the various conflict steps? <br/><br/>The game is simple but there are many little details to keep track of, a 1 page summary would rock. For example, in contests (conflicts) the instigator acts by building their dice pool and rolling. The target can then give in for free before they build their dice pool and roll or stick it out and roll to react. If they want to give in after they roll, they pay a plot point to their attacker. You compare rolls and if one side rolls 5 over, they can stress the other person out of the conflict. Otherwise the person who rolled higher (but not 5 higher) can roll and inflict stress. If the inflicted stress bumps a Stress trait past a d12, then the person may be stressed out of a conflict (like if someone rolled 5 higher). Otherwise, after a person takes stress (but isn't stressed out), they can push forward with the conflict (the stress taken may give the other side bonus dice) or they can choose to stress themselves out to the point that they fall unconscious. Which means bad things can happen to them in the next scene (being captured) but in return they lower their stress traits and receive a plot point.  Stressing out of the conflict doesn't necessarily mean losing, it just means you can't stop the other person (but you aren't forced to do anything specifically yourself). Giving in is when you lose lose! And if someone does give in, there is an optional rule where the winner can return the plot point spent to give in and then pay the loser an additional plot point to stress them even more (and when stress is rolled the GM's trouble resource pool is increased). There are also rules for aiding rolls, interfering with rolls (which has its own list of sub steps as you join the conflict), complications, automatically failing conflicts, spending plot points, and challenging your drives that all affect conflicts. <br/><br/>That all said, it sounds like it plays very fast but I could see people miss an option without a reference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291687/#Comment_291687" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-05T20:19:05+00:00" title="September  5, 2010  8:19PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2010 8:21PM by nemomeme.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/somethingville/downloads" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://sites.google.com/site/somethingville/downloads</a><br/><br/>But I'm probably waiting for the almost inevitable Harper sheet before I try to run it...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_291707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291707/#Comment_291707" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-05T22:24:43+00:00" title="September  5, 2010 10:24PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><br/><br/>That all said, it sounds like it plays very fast but I could see people miss an option without a reference.</blockquote>\nI ended up compiling a six page cheat sheet for my players (with the side benefit of helping me internalize everything while putting it together), and I'm STILL finding weird edge case rules squirreled away in random sidebars.

Maybe because there's a clear structure to handle things mechanically, so you always have a chance to defend yourself from someone else's dickery instead of having to constantly monitor the offending character so they don't lay some kind of devastating ambush.<br/><br/>The role of the GM in this game is also unusual-- I find myself almost having nothing to do, because once you frame a scene with two PCs and a reason for them to disagree, they kind of just make their own gravy.  This also tends to result in a bloated Trouble Pool with seemingly little reason to use it-- I don't need to add more tension to a scene where the PCs are butting heads, do I?  Adding to this, I find that Complications can often spawn follow-up scenes dealing with the fallout.  This seems at odds with the book, which seems to assume the PCs will manage to tidily wrap up the plot caused by this episode's Wedges within one session instead of spiraling off into unforeseen territory...<br/><br/>Oh, and here's a question: does anyone find the Statements for the Values and Relationships easier or harder to deal with than Burning X Beliefs?  A Smallville character has way more Statements than a Burning PC does Beliefs, but they're so much more inherently focused that I find them much more intuitive.  The handful of times I've tried burning up a character I end up completely lost for ideas because the game seems to assume you're going into character creation with a fully fleshed-out idea and don't need any external prompts to inspire you, which is not at all how I tend to make characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_291721">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291721/#Comment_291721" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-06T00:48:28+00:00" title="September  6, 2010 12:48AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe McGuffin</cite>I don't need to add more tension to a scene where the PCs are butting heads, do I?</blockquote>\nIf you have a ton of Trouble points, it's because they've been gaining all sorts of unfair advantages, it's about time to start kicking some crotches in.<br/><br/>By the way, this will also really push the PCs to see how much they value their disagreement. "Sure, you guys are fighting, cool, well, do you care enough to still fight now that...YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE IS ON FIRE?!"\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe McGuffin</cite>Maybe because there's a clear structure to handle things mechanically, so you always have a chance to defend yourself from someone else's dickery instead of having to constantly monitor the offending character so they don't lay some kind of devastating ambush.</blockquote>\nWell, and because it's entirely based on the characters' Values. In other words, the D&amp;D guy who backstabs the party is saying "I value money more than friendship and camraderie" even if he isn't really meaning to express anything of the sort. There's no weight to it, nobody knows or cares why. Certainly we can't trust what that asshole said or did before. In Smallville, every single roll includes <i>why you are doing what you're doing</i>.  Nobody ever, in the entire game, has to wonder, why is that guy doing that thing? Because we can all see what Value they're rolling.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joe McGuffin</cite>Oh, and here's a question: does anyone find the Statements for the Values and Relationships easier or harder to deal with than Burning X Beliefs?

What if by cutting to the middle of a scene you end up skipping something a player really wanted to do first? Simple! Hand them a plot point and then let them spend it at anytime to reveal his past preparations mid scene. You could even incorporate a super quick flashback showing how it happened. Brilliant! The book is full of these tricks. I especially like that the Sneaky trait lets you spend a plot point to reveal something you palmed from the previous scene.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292252/#Comment_292252" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-08T11:22:29+00:00" title="September  8, 2010 11:22AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Has anyone played multiple sessions yet?

I have also noticed that most of us have raised relationships and focused on a few Assets or Powers, so there is not a long list of traits to shop from on the sheets for dice and that what we do have on the sheets generally informs the direction of the fiction so we know what dice to use walking in to a conflict often.<br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293823/#Comment_293823" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-17T16:13:00+00:00" title="September 17, 2010  4:13PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2010 4:13PM by JDCorley.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so I have another couple of questions:<br/><br/>On page 9, it says that at the beginning of an episode, you roll everyone's Relationship dice, and add the highest two, and the person who wins gets 4 plot points, the lowest person gets 2, and everyone else gets 3.

Sometimes, however, our copyediting and proofreading corrections didn't make it to the final proof of the book in time for press, but I updated the PDF file with those. And I'll be doing that again, once we go back to press on the book, for others that slipped under our radar. So that's on me, not Amanda.<br/><br/>I would use the 4/3/2 Plot Point spread for smaller groups and the 3/2/1 for standard groups.

"I rolled like crap," etc). Those are fun and really helpful for <br/>navigating how the game works, moreso than if you'd used analytical, IF/THEN language.<br/><br/>The boxes on the Dicerolling chart feel way too wordy, but i'm not sure if that can be helped. Smallville is awesome, but the procedure is pretty meaty and takes some explaining. My feeling on reading those dense paragraphs, though, is, "well, i could just be reading the book at this point. I (having read the book) can just kind of skim over them, but presumably the chart should help players who don't have that advantage.<br/><br/>The Conflict chart doesn't have that problem so much. Most of the boxes have simple statements and they come in lists. Great! And I really like the thought balloon for "I'm not sure." It's great to <br/>reserve that kind of advice for times of player uncertainty: if they're humming merrily along with ho trouble deciding whether or not to react, great!

I think you've gone a long way toward that platonic ideal.<br/><br/>My inaugural Smallville group (New Mutants) had to convert to PTA in 2 sessions on account of that difficulty. Though in all honesty, this level of mechanical complexity never had a chance with that group's preferences, something I didn't put in the due diligence to suss out beforehand. Anyhow, based on that experience I wrote a sub for the Cortex Hacker's Guide on fluently teaching the rules--basically bolting coked-up Dogs Initiations onto the Pathways steps! I'm pretty proud of it, but it basically focuses on the start of play.

I have a couple.<br/><br/>Extras are rated as two dice (e.g. 2d8). The first time they're used, the full rating (2d8) is rolled. What dice are rolled for the second use? 1d8 or 2d6?<br/><br/>When can players use plot points to modify their action totals? When we played it, A would roll and declare a total, then B would roll, beating A, so A would spend some plot points to add some dice to their total, then B would respond with more plot points, and so on. But looking at the rules again, it seems that once A has declared their total (maybe after spending plot points), they can't alter that total without rolling the dice anew. Which is right?<br/><br/>Does the bonus for challenging a relationship or value statement last for only one roll, or for a whole conflict? For instance A challenges their Duty to tell their boss where to stick it (now rolling 3d8), the boss responds and beats A's total, and A wants to reroll to push things. Does A roll 3d8 again, for the same challenge, or 1d6 (Duty now stepped down), or 3d6 (Duty stepped down and challenged again)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324698/#Comment_324698" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T06:54:15+00:00" title="May 16, 2011  6:54AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            EXTRAS:<br/><br/>Extras are pools of dice. When you roll each die, you spend it for the rest of the episode. So if I have 2d8, I can use both 2d8 in a single roll or split up those two dice and add 1d8 to two separate rolls. Instead of 2d8, think of it as a pool of 1d8, 1d8. When you roll those dice, you spend them. You can roll as many or as few as you want. They refresh at the start of the next episode. And the most important thing to remember\u2026 you add these dice to your final result\u2026 not to your general die pool. So they are very powerful! <br/><br/>PLOT POINTS:<br/><br/>In most situations, people rolling against each other don't roll at the same time*. The active player rolls and may spend plot points before and after the roll. But once they declare their result, they are done. Then the reacting player does the same thing. In most cases, there shouldn't be a back and forth escalating war of\u2026 well if you spend X plot points\u2026 I will spend X+2! Also keep in mind, when you spend plot points, you give them to your opposition. But any plot points you earn in a contest can't be spent in that same contest. <br/><br/>*When you aren't sure who the active player is, you both roll and whomever has the highest result is the active player. This may be one of the few times spending plot points may run into what you're talking about. <br/><br/>CHALLENGING TRAITS:<br/><br/>The book says when you challenge a relationship or value, you roll triple its value but then step down its normal value for the rest of the episode. I'm not 100% sure but I think that means you only roll the tripled value once. In general, that should be powerful enough to blow away your opposition (especially if you spend plot points to keep more dice in your final result).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324700/#Comment_324700" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T07:42:22+00:00" title="May 16, 2011  7:42AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My reading of the Extra/Location rules is that you always roll the full 2d8, and take either the highest die or (if you're going to use it all at one time) both dice.<br/><br/>John is right on about rolling. In fact, you can't even spend plot points to bring more dice into your pool after you roll the pool but before your opponent does. Rolling is: STEP 1: gathering dice from various things, STEP 2: rolling them and adding the highest two (or more), STEP 3: Generating Complications if any.  You don't ever go backwards.<br/><br/>I would let challenged stuff stay tripled for the whole conflict. My reasoning is that this is the conflict that is expressing the challenge, no matter how many steps the conflict takes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324706/#Comment_324706" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T08:12:54+00:00" title="May 16, 2011  8:12AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2011 8:15AM by jenskot.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Jason and I may be both wrong about extras!

As you say, you can also keep the second result for that use of the Resource but then you're down to nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou basically get two uses out of your Extra or Location for the episode. The first use is skewed toward a higher number on account of it being rolling two and keeping the highest. Note that if somebody else has the same Extra or Location as you, them using it also counts. So you can cheese off other players with the same Resources by getting in there before they do.<br/>\n<br/>\nChallenged dice, Useful Details, bonus dice from triggered Distinctions or Abilities, etc etc all stay until the end of a Contest or Test. So, in the case of the triple die, they're there until one of you gives in or stresses the other. Then they go away and the die is stepped back. In some cases it's almost wise to Give In to a Contest where somebody's challenged one of their Drives because then later you can always come back and try again against their weaker Value or Relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nCam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324712/#Comment_324712" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T08:33:05+00:00" title="May 16, 2011  8:33AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm, looks like I need to update the Rolling flowchart again. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324773/#Comment_324773" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T13:51:18+00:00" title="May 16, 2011  1:51PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, you cad.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nCam                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324777/#Comment_324777" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T14:22:51+00:00" title="May 16, 2011  2:22PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the answers, all!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324780/#Comment_324780" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-16T14:43:43+00:00" title="May 16, 2011  2:43PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hadn't thought about it, but aren't you still bound by your original Value statement when using the Value in a future challenge?

The one thing I would clarify is although neither side has to do their telegraphed actions in a situation where nobody Gives In, there's still a winner and a loser.  The winner achieves what they were trying to do, they just don't get the loser to play the part they wanted them to play.<br><br>Example from my other thread:<br><br>Roxy Rocket's robbing a bank. Superman's being Superman.<br/><br/>Superman: "Stop your evilness and come away with me to jail!" Telegraphed action: Roxy surrenders. He rolls dice.<br/>Roxy: "Never, Superfool, you best help me escape or I'll kill this cute widdle puppy dog!" Telegraphed action: Superman helps her escape. She rolls dice.<br/><br/>They go back and forth.<br/><br/>Superman wins.  Roxy doesn't have to surrender, but Superman's player, the GM and the group (including Roxy's player) come up with a suitable result based on what Superman's player wants and what each of them narrated back and forth during the conflict.  A good example would be Superman blasting her with laser eyes ("They're not called laser eyes!") and knocking her out and carting her off to jail, saving the puppy dog.  Another one might be Superman stopping the robbery and saving the puppy dog, but Roxy makes her escape.  It's all about Superman's priorities at this point, and what kind of Stress is going to be inflicted on Roxy.  Maybe he just flat punches her out and Injures her or maybe he laughs in her face and makes her Angry, or maybe he takes her out so fast that she is Insecure about her position as bandit queen of Metropolis' skies.<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>Roxy wins.  Superman doesn't have to help her escape, but Roxy's player, the GM and the group (including Superman's player) come up with a suitable result based on what Roxy wants.  A good example would be Roxy escaping on her rocket and throwing the widdle puppy dog off, making Superman have to divert to save it, or maybe she sets off a smoke bomb and in the confusion makes her escape, or maybe her ray gun actually injures Superman and she gets away before he recovers.  It's all about what Roxy wants at this point, and the Stress being inflicted on Superman. Maybe he's Angry because she tricked him, or Exhausted due to being hit with a ray gun, or Insecure because a civilian got hurt or killed, or whatever.<br/><br/>I think a lot of people look at "neither side gets what they telegraphed" as neither side getting ANYTHING they want. Which is not right. Someone still gets what they want. They just don't get the other side to do what they want.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331240/#Comment_331240" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-22T15:17:41+00:00" title="June 22, 2011  3:17PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I like.

Really, all Stressing Out does is completely take the opponent out of the picture. Otherwise, <i>something</i> has to be resolved, or the loser gaining Stress would make no sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331537/#Comment_331537" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-24T20:15:41+00:00" title="June 24, 2011  8:15PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2011 8:18PM by noclue.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Otherwise,<i>something</i>has to be resolved, or the loser gaining Stress would make no sense.</blockquote>\nWell, something happens in the fiction, if that's what you mean. Superman manages to burn her with heat vision or Roxy throws the puppy dog and inflicts insecure stress. Things happen, but Roxy hasn't escaped (I guess escaping without Superman's help would be kosher, because her goal was actually Superman helping her escape) and Superman hasn't stopped her Evilness .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331546/#Comment_331546" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-24T23:52:29+00:00" title="June 24, 2011 11:52PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2011 12:01AM by JDCorley.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>Things happen, but Roxy hasn't escaped (I guess escaping without Superman's help would be kosher, because her goal was actually Superman helping her escape) and Superman hasn't stopped her Evilness .</blockquote>\nYep, that's exactly it. She's allowed to escape (without Superman helping) if she wins. Superman is allowed to stop her evilness (without her surrendering) if he wins.  Or neither of those two things could happen and some completely different thing could happen, focused on the desires of the winning character. What we know DOESN'T happen is Superman doesn't help and Roxy doesn't surrender.<br/><br/>Like, the example in the book is this:<br/><br/>If Lois can walk up to Clark, telegraph "Tell me everything you know about this Superman guy", roll a shitload of dice, win, and he has to tell her everything, then there's no show.<br/><br/>So what happens instead is Lois telegraphs "Tell me everything you know about this Superman guy" and Clark telegraphs "lay off the Superman story, you won't get anywhere" and they all roll dice at each other, and if Lois wins, maybe she pisses off Clark with her pestering and he lets something slip about another situation (Anger Stress) or maybe she wears him down over time and gets him to make out with her and while they're making out she steals his keys to the top secret Daily Planet file cabinet (Exhausted Stress) or if he wins, maybe he deflects her with jibes about her love life and she flounces off, missing the next big tip that comes in (Insecure Stress) or whatever.  Winning has to <i>mean something</i> or else why win?<br/><br/>What DOESN'T happen is that Clark doesn't tell Lois everything he knows about this Superman guy, and Lois doesn't lay off the Superman story.<br/><br/>This is why telegraphing is NEVER "what I want to do" and is always "what I want the other guy to do". Superman doesn't telegraph "I want to stop Roxy". NO, that's wrong.  He has to telegraph what he wants Roxy to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12937/a-great-thing-about-smallville-and-some-questions" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12937/a-great-thing-about-smallville-and-some-questions" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12937/a-great-thing-about-smallville-and-some-questions/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12937%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12937%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
