The system I think is fairly solid it is the GM advice sections that really need work and the only way to write those is to get people playing it. This is the first time I have done a game like this: opening it up very early on for playtesting, so I have no idea how it will go.<br/><br/>All the best<br/><br/>Iain<br/><br/><a href="http://www.contestedground.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Mob Justice</a> coming soon!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
