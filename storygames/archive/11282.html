That latter part is the interesting bit: not only did I pester my brother to work up a new character sheet for TSoY, but I also published a lost chapter from WoN as a sort of preview/expansion of the book. It's a modest little thing about vampires, which I left out of the book proper due to suspicions on my part that others wouldn't appreciate leeches in their Near.<br/><br/>I collected some central TSoY resources on the page I link above - if I've missed anything that needs to be on the page, do let me know.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
