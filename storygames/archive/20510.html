If you get 4 FPs, you get a bonus scene for your villain.  If you get 4 SPs, you get to direct a bonus scene for someone else's villain.<br/><br/>I have found that 3 bonus scenes is a good number per villain; 4 is okay too; 2 is okay, but not as good as 4; 5 is too many; 1 is too few.  If the group wants a quicker game, then 4 is too many.<br/><br/>I have come up with various ways of putting points in circulation which I estimate at anywhere from 10 to 19 per player.  However, when I look at those, I realize that I don't know how many bonus scenes to expect because of remainders.  <br/><br/>Let's say the average player earns 14 total points.  That's 3.5 scenes.  But it isn't, right?  We shouldn't actually expect that the most typical outcome (median or mode; I'm curious about both) for your villain is 2 bonus scenes you control and 1 or 2 bonus scenes someone else controls (or the reverse), right?  Because with 14 points, you CAN'T get 4 scenes.  In fact, if you have 11 SPs and 3 FPs (or the reverse), you could wind up with only 2!<br/><br/>Can anyone give me a formula that I can plug my expected points into that will turn out likely numbers of scenes?<br/><br/>Re: the tweaks I'm considering for what points to put into circulation, they include SPs, generic points that could become FPs or SPs at equal rates, and generic points that are likely to become FPs 2 to 3 times as often as SPs (just based on how people tend to award fanmail).<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450757/#Comment_450757" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-20T09:54:18+00:00" title="January 20, 2016  9:54AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a> I know you haz the mad math skills...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450758/#Comment_450758" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-20T11:12:22+00:00" title="January 20, 2016 11:12AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2016 11:17AM by Guy Srinivasan.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Suppose you have X points, and each is SP with independent probability p.

So maybe just clarifying it will help.<br/><br/>Are you saying that X points are "in circulation", meaning "X points get awarded during the total run of a game"? Or do you mean something else? It could be interpreted a few different ways.<br/><br/>After all, when the points get awarded also affects the math (if, for instance, half are distributed during the first phase play, and the second half during the second).<br/><br/>One thing you can do by yourself is to just take the "remainders" (small numbers, after all) and write out all the possible combinations, to get a sense of the possible outcomes. (It's not that hard, since there aren't that many possible combinations.)<br/><br/>For instance, how many different ways can you divide 5 points among 3 players?<br/><br/>0,0,5 x3<br/>0,1,4 x6 <i>(014 104 140 041 410 401)</i><br/>0,2,3 x6<br/>1,2,2 x3<br/><br/>So, with five points in circulation, you have 18 possible distributions.<br/><br/>Out of those:<br/><br/>Half (9/18) mean no scenes at all.<br/>Half (9/18) mean one scene happens.<br/><br/>It's not a solution to your problem (yet), but we can see that adding 5 points results in half a scene (50% possibility of one extra scene). <br/><br/>This won't hold if players already have points to begin with; we'd have to estimate further. But if your method of distribution is fairly equilateral, you can very roughly estimate that 12 points + 5 points, for a total of 17, gives you 3 or 4 scenes total. Two scenes is unlikely, but possible (3,3,4,5), and five is clearly impossible.<br/><br/>You might be able to get a decent estimate this way (possibly good enough for a playtest), until a proper calculation can be made by someone more math-savvy than me.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450772/#Comment_450772" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-20T18:03:57+00:00" title="January 20, 2016  6:03PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You rang? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Simplest solution, it seems to me, would be to allow both rounding and horse-trading: players can give each other FPs and SPs on a 1-to-1 basis in order to make even groups of 4.<br/><br/>Hmm, actually. Try this. There are only three possible remainders, right? 1, 2, or 3. If you have a remainder of 1 in one of your pools, it converts into the other type of point. (If you have remainders of 1 in both pools, you choose which converts into which.) If you have 2 or 3 remainder points, then you just round up.<br/><br/>Not enough games use rounding correctly, in my opinion. They're all like "always round down" and I'm like motherfucker it's like 9/10 what the hell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450773/#Comment_450773" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-20T18:48:07+00:00" title="January 20, 2016  6:48PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2016 6:48PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or alternatively (perhaps too complex, but worth considering):<br/><br/>Can you make up for being a point or two short with some kind of compromise?<br/><br/>If you are missing one point, the player on your left gets to state one unpleasant detail for you to include, that kind of thing?

On the Joker's turn, he earns his third FP and asks Harley Quinn to invest 1 FP from her reserve to narrate a scene in which the two villains obtain something from Batman. <br/>The responsibility and character involvement should be, if possible, shared between all contributing players (e.g. the Joker is the main character of the scene, likely having a confrontation with Batman, and Harley Quinn is featured in the Joker's scene in a minor role).<br/><br/>Leftover points at the end of the "regular" scenes could be assigned to other players who have more, spending them until no more than 3 points of each type are left in total. <br/>Example rule: sort the player by decreasing total points, then by decreasing highest number of leftover points in the two categories, then by other extremely important tie-breaking criteria.<br/>Then the top player does an extra scene, of the type that corresponds to the category in which he has the most points, paid with all his leftover points and some or all of the points of the appropriate category of the bottom player or players.

For example, 18. Subtract the average wasted points for each type of scene, which is the average of {0,1,2,3} or 1.5. Two types of scenes, so subtract twice, or in total subtract 3. Now we have 15. Divide by 4, getting 3.75. The number of scenes will be 3 (25%) or 4 (75%).<br/><br/>Alternatively and equivalently, do the simple division and subtract 0.75.<br/><br/>(X-3)/4, integer part is base number of scenes, fractional part is probability you'll get +1 scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450818/#Comment_450818" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-21T23:19:57+00:00" title="January 21, 2016 11:19PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2016 11:22PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That matches our shorthand calculations (from last night), thanks! <br/><br/>Nice.
