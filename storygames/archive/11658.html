Only 2 PCs can level between Missions.<br/><br/>In AD316 Gregor introduces Tokens (Accomplishments) as an additional way to level. In the Development phase the PC with the highest Kills and the one with the most Tokens roll to see which one levels. After that all the other PCs that didn't level roll to see which one also gains a level. There is still the limit of 2 PCs levelling between Missions.<br/><br/>I want to introduce a more "organic" way of levelling. I was thinking of using Tokens as a kind of experience points. A PC levels after gaining a number of Tokens. Let's say a PC levels after gaining 10 Tokens.<br/><br/>Would this be a fun alternative way of levelling? It seems more "fair" to me. This means that more than 2 PCs might level after a Mission but I can't see a problem with that.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260029/#Comment_260029" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-04T07:52:14+00:00" title="March  4, 2010  7:52AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought the entire point of not leveling at all from tokens is that the players will be tempted to go for kill heavy weapons with only 1 or 2 killing ranges which actually makes them less effective in combat and also be pissed at comrades going the kill heavy but low effective way since they grab all the levels. The point of only 2 PCs leveling per planet is obviously to only give PCs 1 strength per planet on average.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260096/#Comment_260096" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-04T17:23:59+00:00" title="March  4, 2010  5:23PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Who said 3:16 is fair?<br/><br/>It's a dark setting. It's about power-hungry, murderous marines who think their doing their duty to a grateful human empire, only to find out that they are actually cannon-fodder in a genocidal war where the ends justify the means regardless of the cost to the pawns involved.<br/><br/>There is little rhyme or reason to advancement in a tyrannical bureaucracy. Those who perform best for their overlords get a bonus; while toadying, betrayal and white-collar politics allow someone else to advance for no apparent reason (to everyone else).<br/><br/>Changing the advancement system totally changes the theme of the game, it makes the game less insidious and makes it something for pussy-weak democracy-loving tree huggers...rather than a tribute to glory and bravery in a neo-fascist empire.<br/><br/>Unless of course that's what you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260139">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mordheim" title="mordheim"><img alt="mordheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.darkreign40k.com/drjoomla/images/comprofiler/tn62_47cea863027df.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mordheim">mordheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260139/#Comment_260139" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-05T00:13:03+00:00" title="March  5, 2010 12:13AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can influence how many PCs level after a Mission by the number of Tokens necessary to level. If the GM rules that you need 10 Tokens to level than at the most 2 PCs can level in a 4-player game (24 Tokens). Which limits the number of Strengths available as I agree with Krippler than Strengths should be limited.<br/><br/>In "my" system Killing things is still the easiest way to gain Tokens. So I don't think I make the game more attractive to "pussy-weak democracy-loving tree huggers". We don't want that.....<br/><br/>Maybe the PC with the highest Kills at the and of a Mission gains an additional 2 Tokens, to "tempt" players to go for Big Fuckin Guns(tm).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
