PCs would encounter mutant raiders, strange monsters, and crazed wastelanders as they each strive to maintain their Hope and Humanity.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe setting is still very much in-development, and nothing is really set in stone yet. Thematically, my main influences are  Fallout (the video game) + Rustbelt + Don't Rest Your Head, with some of the mechanics more informed by FATEs Aspects, and John Harper's Lady Blackbird (I use a modified Trait mechanic, but we'll get to that some other time).<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to post the skeleton of my resolution system here to see if I can gain some insights as to how it might shake out, primarily, the interactions between Hope, Humanity, Pain and Stress.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's a few terms, and roughly what they mean:<br/>\n<br/>\nHope- this is represented by a number, starting at 10. There should also be a sentence, which is essentially a character goal. The PCs' Hope is the reason that they continue to press onward and travel the Waste. Without Hope, man becomes a Slave; he can fight the Waste no longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nHumanity- this is also represented by a number, probably a range between 1 and 20. Without Humanity, man becomes a Monster.<br/>\n<br/>\nStress- this is the GM's dice pool that he rolls against the PC's whenever there is a conflict. The number of dice is chosen based on both the difficulty, and relative importance of the task being undertaken.<br/>\n<br/>\nPain- this is a dice pool that the PC rolls against himself. Pain dice are earned and kept when a PC fails a conflict roll, and elects to 'Take the Pain'. You'll see how this works below.<br/>\n========<br/>\nCONFLICT RESOLUTION:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Declare Intent - the Player announces a task for his character, like "I want to kill those 3 bandits", or "I want to hotwire this old Buick". The GM will then announce his own Intent for the scene, like "The bandits want to capture you", or "I want the Buick to backfire, and blow its engine".<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Gather dice - the Player gathers a dice pool based on the Lifepaths and Aspects on his character sheet. This pool will be between 1 and 10 dice. The GM will gather an amount of stress dice determined by the relative difficulty, also between 1 (very easy, or not relatively important) and 10 (very difficult of pivotal to achieve the character's Hope)<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Dice are rolled and compared. The highest die on each side are compared to one another, with person who has the higher roll succeeding.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. If there is a tie, compare to the next highest die. If one person runs out of dice to compare, the person with dice remaining wins the conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. The <i>degree</i> of success is the difference between the two dice that are compared to one another. If one person runs out of dice to compare (due to ties), then they effectively have rolled a 0.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. If the player succeeds on the roll, their Intent happens. If the GM wins the roll, then the GM's Intent happens, unless the player decides to <i>Take the Pain</i>. The player can elect to take an amount of Pain dice equal to the degree of failure on the conflict roll. If he does this, his original Intent for the conflict succeeds (instead of the GM), but with some type of complication with severity equal to the amount of Pain dice he just took.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, what are Pain dice used for?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn future conflicts, the GM will roll Stress dice against the player as normal. The player will roll two separate pools: one from his Aspects and Lifepaths (as above), and a set of different color dice for Pain. Pain will be counted with the GM's Stress in order to determine who succeeds on their Intent.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb" title="Charlie Gilb"><img alt="Charlie Gilb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/1/23/2281732/Acadia%20show.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb">Charlie Gilb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209305/#Comment_209305" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-27T15:23:07+00:00" title="May 27, 2009  3:23PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When Pain is taken by a player, he writes down how it comes about. Here are a few examples, not all of which occured in physical combats:<br/>\n<br/>\n-Took a shotgun blast to the hand (2)<br/>\n-Bitten in the hand by a giant rat (1)<br/>\n-Thought I saw my brother's ghost (3)<br/>\n-Angry about being conned by a card shark (2)<br/>\n<br/>\nPain sticks around, until the player alleviates it in the game. Pain can be alleviated in some cases by doing things within the fiction, like finding healing (and making a roll against the those Pain dice) or tracking down the card shark that duped you. Things like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nOR players can elect to spend Hope, in order to alleviate Pain on a 1-for-1 basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nA PC can re-gain Hope points by pursuing whatever it is the listed in their Hope description. Hope awards should be sporadic and only given for successfully progressing their character's story. Hope should also be given for a PC helping another PC with their Hope. I am still working on more specifics here.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Hope ever goes down to 0, the PC kills himself at the first appropriate opportunity. The player should have narrative authority over this.<br/>\n<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>\n<br/>\nHumanity- At any time, Humanity can be sacrificed to aid in any conflict roll, even increasing the PC's dice pool above 10. Humanity is sacrificed on a 1 point for 1 die basis. However, this sacrifice should symbolize the character giving in to more base, primal instincts. If there is an especially brutal, malicious, or violent solution to the conflict, then the player must take it, to a degree based on the amount of Humanity he is sacrificing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother way to lose Humanity- Whenever a time arises when a character's Pain exceeds his Hope, make an opposed Pain vs Hope roll. If Pain wins, the difference is subtracted from Humanity. If Hope wins, nothing happens. If Hope is 0, then the roll is unopposed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Humanity reaches 0, the PC becomes a Monster, and is unplayable.<br/>\n<br/>\nPC can regain Humanity by showing Compassion for others, saving lives, and generally going out of their way to improve the lives of others in the Wastes.<br/>\n<br/>\n===================<br/>\n<br/>\nAll right, time for my thoughts and questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe intent behind this system is to facilitate the telling of very tragic, grim tales of survival and the moral choices involved. One thing of note is that there is no possible way for the GM to directly kill the PC without the player's go ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe player can:<br/>\n1. elect to spend all of his Hope to commit suicide,<br/>\n2. keep going until all Humanity is lost and the PC becomes a Monster,<br/>\n3. fail a roll when the GM's Intent is to kill the character and elect not to Take the Pain<br/>\n<br/>\nNot exactly cheerful ends, but I personally like the idea of giving the player some level of control over the PC's demise, should it happen. I would like to hear people's thoughts about these options, and anyway to make them perhaps a bit more interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that I will really have to get through playtesting is how many opportunities there should be to regain Hope and Humanity in order to allow for an engaging, scary, and dangerous game that isn't a hopeless downward spiral for the PC's (unless that is the group's goal).<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeally, stories should involve very strong moral choices where the PC's Hope will be at odds with their Humanity. I might even specify that Hope should be something that might even be a little selfish to ensure that this type of conflict occurs.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and 'Monster' is still ill-defined, but I kinda like it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestions:<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the above interesting to you?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any holes or things I seem to be overlooking?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the currency between Stress, Pain, Hope, and Humanity clear?<br/>\n<br/>\nMost importantly: Are there other questions I should really be asking here?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb" title="Charlie Gilb"><img alt="Charlie Gilb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/1/23/2281732/Acadia%20show.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb">Charlie Gilb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209306/#Comment_209306" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-27T15:25:33+00:00" title="May 27, 2009  3:25PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apologies if any of that is unclear.

What does your game do or say that Sorcerer can't?<br><br>c) Lots of designers have tried to shy away from the word 'stakes' ever since somebody said something disparaging about stakes.  If you're designing something with stakes, call them stakes.  It does you no good, and in fact detracts from the plain-english utility of your game, to call them something else just because 'stakes' is presently unfashionable.<br><br>d) Right now, you have three giant inputs that are up to GM discretion (which is a polite way of saying fiat) \u2014 determining Stress, affording opportunities for Hope refresh, and affording opportunities for Humanity refresh.  This means that the game set up allows GMs to beat the living shit out of players by setting high difficulties that sap their currency and the denying them the opportunity to regain that currency.  If that's the sort of social set up you're going for, great!  Spot-on target.  If you're not looking for a game where the GM clobbers the players with the story-stick until they give up, then you might want to consider giving authority of currency-refreshes to the players \u2014 so you decide when you refresh, or (better) you decide when other PCs refresh.<br><br>e) I rather like your context-defined damage-alternative Pain.  Do I always roll all of my Pain, or only the Pain that's relevant to the thing that I'm doing?  If the latter, who decides what's relevant and what's not?

The point of the game is to tell interesting, tragic stories. I might be misunderstanding your question. Could you please clarify? Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nJosh Roby-<br/>\n<br/>\na) I am aware, but I really like the community here, so I figured I would post it up. I plan on taking it over to the Forge once I get my feet under me a little more.<br/>\n<br/>\nb) I have played Sorcerer, one time. And yeah, in a lot of ways, I can see the similarities (it actually kinda bothers me to call Humanity the same thing, since they are very similar). What my game does that Sorcerer can't is provide a lot of the same types of stories and situations, but with (in my opinion) a more interesting resolution system, and slightly more "crunch". I like the damage and combat mechanics in my game more, and the idea that you can always succeed in doing something if you are willing to take the pain with it. Also, the rest of my game will have a few more traditional trappings, like more extensive skill and aspect lists, and special abilities called Scars, which I have not gotten to here. I think that as I get the conflict resolution mechanics hashed out, the names of a few things will change.<br/>\n<br/>\nc) Are you suggesting that I just say that each side "sets stakes", instead of "determining intent"? I can see how that would be easier, and I have no problem using the term stakes (or any other term for that matter), if it will be more clear. I know my writing is a bit less than professional in the posts above, and I appreciate the input.<br/>\n<br/>\nd) My plan was to give a certain level of authority to the Players for times they refresh. At any time, they can spend Hope to alleviate pain, and at any time, they can dictate when they want to go through other tasks to alleviate Pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as Hope or Humanity refreshes, maybe some type of rule that allows the players an opportunity for a "refresh scene" after they have spent a certain amount of points would be a good diea. With that in mind, I do want this to very much be the type of game where the GM is beating the shit out of the players, BUT I also don't want the players to feel powerless. I have been reading a bit of Mouse Guard lately, and I am thinking something similar to a Player's Turn might be the best solution. One other idea I had was to allow Player's to be able to transfer Hope between one another.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is definitely the area that I feel needs the most thought, and I thank you for bringing it up. I certainly don't want it to be the type of game where the GM has to beat everyone with his story-stick all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\ne) My preliminary thoughts are that you would roll all of your pain, every time. Ideally, healing from any Pain would either be done by spending Hope, or a player-initiated conflict with healing as part of the stakes. I hope that clears it up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209392/#Comment_209392" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-28T11:02:00+00:00" title="May 28, 2009 11:02AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2009 11:02AM by Marshall Burns.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Charlie,<br>I'd like to help, but first I need you to answer a question, and I also need you to not take it the wrong way.

I appreciate you chiming in. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest, I haven't read much of the Rustbelt, and even what I did read was quite awhile ago (when you first popped up on the Forge with that first draft of it in that .doc file... that was two years ago?).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I can (at least vaguely) state why the Rustbelt doesn't do what I want it to. Here goes:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. I didn't want to have stats that (roughly) represent a character's physical/mental capabilities. With this game, you can choose to represent those with Aspects, if you want.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. From what I remember, I found the exchanges between Rustbelt's emotional attributes (can I call them that? I mean Vices, Virtues, Faith, and the others), to be a bit confusing. I don't want quite so many playing off of each other. One of my other goals is accessibility to new players, and in this game, players make <i>one single statement</i> about what their character wants. I am hoping that this results in more tightly focused play.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. The interactions you had between Blood, Sweat, and Tears seemed interesting to me, but I didn't see the need to track different types of 'damage'. To me, it just wasn't that compelling.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. I found the magic rules (which you have since cut out?) to be very out of place. I think that a straight up trade in Humanity in my game to be able to do something 'extraordinary' is cleaner, simpler, and more representative of the themes.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, my critiques above might not be very fair, because honestly I am not overly familiar with your game. I just remember reading it, and thinking "this is really sweet, but I bet it could be done without a lot of this stuff in there".

The easiest way to survive, after all, is to risk nothing - and therefore be boring as all hell.

Let me see if I can explain a bit better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the story should at least partially be its own reward. If I were to ask a group to play this, I would say:<br/>\n<br/>\n"This game is called 'the Waste'. It is designed to tell grim stories about Hope, Humanity, and Horror in a post-apocalyptic future. Players take on the role of people trying to eek out an existence in a world that threatens to literally turn them into monsters."<br/>\n<br/>\nI would argue that the players should have to buy into this, before even trying to get them to play. If they can't or don't want to play a game like that, then they don't have to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, there should be in-game rewards and advancement for the players. I thought of this thing called Scars, which I think is kinda neat:<br/>\n<br/>\nScars represent "extra special" abilities that PCs have as a consequence of hardship their character has faced in the past. They might be used to allow re-rolls, give bonus dice in conflicts, or add or subtract from Pain, Hope, or Humanity. In essence, Scars let you "break the rules".<br/>\n<br/>\nAn example Scar might be:<br/>\n<br/>\nBerzerker- Magnus witnessed raiders mercilessly slay his entire village. Sometimes, the memories of this tragedy possess him in combat, and drive him to fight with a bestial level of savagery. In combat, every point of Humanity he sacrifices in action grants him 2 extra dice, instead of 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like this option, because it tells the turtling player to stop being a wuss and take the Pain more often. Alleviated Pain is tracked in another area on the character sheet, and once a certain amount is reached, a new Scar is earned. Alternatively, maybe alleviated Pain can be exchanged to get more lifepaths and aspects as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs a mechanical Reward like that what you are getting at, Misuba? I think it could work out really well, because characters only get what they want by undergoing hardship, and it is only through hardship that they get better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209422/#Comment_209422" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-28T13:46:51+00:00" title="May 28, 2009  1:46PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Charlie G</cite>c) Are you suggesting that I just say that each side "sets stakes", instead of "determining intent"?

The characters are defined through their actions and decisions. These have consequences, which is what the Price and the Psyche mechanics are all about, and sooner or later the cracks start to show somewhere. But on the level of moral judgment, it's all subjective and up to the "viewer," as it were. Different players can (and have) pass different judgments on the same character's morality.

It is interesting to hear your reasons for why you chose not to include Hope and Humanity in a quantifiable way, and opted to use mechanics for other things like Psych and Price. That isn't quite the direction I feel like I want to go in this game, but to each their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nHumanity is my biggest concern right now. There are a number of systems out there that try to represent it in a (equal) number of ways; WoD and Sorcerer are the first two that come to my mind-- I have the most experience with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think in order for the Waste to really work, I will need to think long and hard about what I want Hope and Humanity to mean exactly. That will really determine the overriding thematic content of this game. Hell, it could be as simple as giving guidelines to each group to define these two terms (as is done with Humanity in Sorcerer), but I am not sure that would be all that satisfying.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother potentiality is to have two questions on the character sheet, with space to answer, from the player's perspective:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. What is your Hope, and what must you do to make it so?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. What does it mean to be Human?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis allows every player to define these two often slippery words on their own terms, and allows each person to be the ultimate judge for their own characters. The trick for the GM would be to individually challenge each player's notions of Hope and Humanity. I wonder if something like that would work.

I'd like to see it do more than increase the difficulty.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's an idea freshly spawned from my brain.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) the player states their Intent / sets stakes / whatever...but the GM does NOT.  The GM's stakes is simply automatically "no that didn't happen".<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Pain dice are rolled by the player and help the player win.  But, if the player wins with a Pain die the result becomes a "yes, and...here's how things just got worst" result.  So the player gets their stakes...but the GM then gets to throw an additional complication, condition, twist, whatever on top.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would be a much more interesting death spiral to me:<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrent Death Spiral:  as Pain increases...failure increases...<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggested Death Spiral:  as Pain increases...success gets more and more complicated.

The part I disagree with is having the GM's stakes be "no, that doesn't happen", if I am understanding you correctly. How about this instead:<br/>\n<br/>\n-Both player and GM set stakes.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Aspects + Lifepath are rolled vs. Stress pool. If player wins, he gets his stakes. If Stress pool wins, player can Take the Pain or allow the GM to get his stakes.<br/>\n<br/>\n-If the Player Takes the Pain, he immediately rolls a number of Pain dice equal to the degree he lost the original opposed roll by. If Pain beats the Stress roll, the player gets his stakes, <i>plus a complication</i>. After this conflict is resolved, these Pain dice will be kept in the player's Pain pool regardless of whether or not Pain beats Stress.<br/>\n<br/>\n- From then on, any dice in the player's Pain pool will be rolled against his regular pool and the Stress pool. This creates a triangle of opposed rolls. More Pain is added when the Stress pool wins and the player elects to take the Pain.<br/>\n<br/>\n====<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that approach might be better (not counting Pain and Aspect dice together), due to how inevitable ties will be with all the d6 dice pools. I also think having the GM have stakes that are actually an event will help move play along after the player fails. The player will then know what would happen next if he elects not to take the Pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not convinced that is entirely what I want, because it eliminates one of my original game premises: "You can succeed at anything if you are willing to take the pain for it". Still, it is worth thinking over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb" title="Charlie Gilb"><img alt="Charlie Gilb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/1/23/2281732/Acadia%20show.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb">Charlie Gilb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209445/#Comment_209445" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-28T16:18:48+00:00" title="May 28, 2009  4:18PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2009 4:20PM by Charlie Gilb.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph- After a bit of thinking about your thoughts on Hope and Humanity, I think I am ready to address some of your points and questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: Valamir&lt;/cite&gt;Is there a compelling need to make these stats?&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, Hope is currently the mechanic in place to make taking on too much Pain a bad thing.

When the player has taken too much Pain, and begins to lose Hope, he gets closer and closer to losing his Humanity.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yeah, I guess with the current design there is a need to make them that way. At present, it is there to reinforce the themes of the game. Without them, how would I show the downside of accumulating Pain?<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: Valamir&lt;/cite&gt;My inclination is that if there is a sufficiently interesting fictional payoff for the players that they will (as players and while playing their characters) exhibit hope that that that payoff is achievable in a way far more interesting than playing to a stat.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly if the payoff is compelling enough that the hope of achieving it comsumes them (both as player and while playing their characters) they will exhibit their humanity, or their inhumanity in what they are willing to do to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there something you can set up in the game that will serve as this fictional payoff so you don't have to use stats to represent hope and humanity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nI really want there to be interesting fictional payoffs for players to exhibit both Hope and (in)Humanity. I guess the question that I have to pose here is: do you think that these mechanics can help facilitate situations where Hope and Humanity are displayed without it seeming like the player is "playing to a stat"? Though maybe I am not convinced that "playing to a stat" and playing for purely fictional payoffs are mutually exclusive. Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209613/#Comment_209613" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-29T16:45:41+00:00" title="May 29, 2009  4:45PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Charlie!<br>I agree with you that the GM should set stakes - if the stakes are "nothing happens" vs. "something happens", then why bother with stakes, or Conflict Resolution, at all? I see no reason to reintroduce whiffing to game design.<br>On that same note, letting the GM cause whiffing basically says "Okay, players! If you want every roll to make something happen, then you're going to have to take the pain all the time. Capice?" I don't like that - to me, it sounds like Taking the Pain is the "teeth" in the phrase "Fortune in the Middle ... with teeth"; as illustrated here, <a href="thanks to Vincent" rel="nofollow">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17825.5%3Bwap2</a>. I daresay that the finality of a whiff, courtesy of Fortune at the End, would be even worse if the PCs had to cut on themselves to make it otherwise. I think that "failing forward" is a wonderful thing, and you should use it in your game design.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_214588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb" title="Charlie Gilb"><img alt="Charlie Gilb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/1/23/2281732/Acadia%20show.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb">Charlie Gilb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214588/#Comment_214588" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T12:50:01+00:00" title="June 26, 2009 12:50PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zac- I totally missed your comment until I came back over to this thread today! The stakes definitely won't be "something happens" vs. "nothing happens". The GM will set stakes separate to the player's, and the roll will determine who gets their stakes. Taking the Pain is definitely the Teeth of Fortune in the Middle (thanks for the link, by the way; I never read that before!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have given a lot of thought to the comments in this thread in the past month. You have all been very helpful. I re-worked the mechanics in such a way where Pain does actually help increase the odds of success, but also increases complications. I like how it works a lot more. Thanks for the insights here, Ralph.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope and Humanity are also gone. Now that I think about it, I think those were two 'sacred cows' that I was really attached to in my design, when ultimately, the aren't integral to what I want. Marshall had an excellent point here about Hope being implied by the simple fact that the characters are even around.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have outlined my revised conflict resolution mechanics as they sit right now over at the Forge, because I think it would be beneficial to have the discussion all in one place. Again, thank you all for your help!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_214620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HiQKid" title="HiQKid"><img alt="HiQKid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HiQKid">HiQKid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/214620/#Comment_214620" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-26T18:00:38+00:00" title="June 26, 2009  6:00PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got a few thoughts - where is your post located on the forge?<br><br>Could you post a link here - it'd probably make it easier for me (and others) following the conversation to move over there.
