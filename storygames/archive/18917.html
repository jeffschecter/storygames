The following is something that's been kicking around in my head for awhile. The following is a lot more of the 'fluff' than substantive rules, but I felt like it was time to put it out there and see what comes back. I'm open to feedback - or at least I try to be!<br/><br/><br/>Promised Land - an Apocalypse World Hack drawing inspiration from the setting of The Book of Mormon. <br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>An NPR interview I listened to a long while ago addressed the impact of religion on  individual choice, particularly how they spend their money. It included a statement by the Jewish interviewee that went something like this: \u201cI try to think \u2018as a Jew, how do I make a purchase. How do I buy things in a Jewish way.\u2019\u201d It got wheels moving, wheels that transported me to a desire for better integration in my life. For letting the aspects of my identity that are most salient and important to me inform the choices I make. I sometimes sit and ask myself \u201cHow does being a straight, male, white, liberal Mormon impact my choices right now?\u201d When I\u2019m particularly feeling circumspect I follow up with the question \u201cShould it? Is that right?\u201d<br/><br/>Many of those demographics, among others I belong to, are privileged identities. Part of privilege includes that you do not have to think about the impact of belonging to the group - it\u2019s the de facto \u201cneutral\u201d  that society has decided upon. I often spend more time thinking on how my non-privileged status impacts my life: being Mormon.<br/><br/>That may all seem very serious, or even pretentious, when describing why a game is being made. However, it lead me to ask how being Mormon impacts my gaming choices. How religious ideas can be explored within narrative settings. How can this be done without being dogmatic but also while being respectful. Can there ever be a Mormon, or even religious voice, in gaming that comes from a place of faith.<br/>My goals for this particular reworking of the Apocalypse World rules are: 1) provide a space to explore the narrative themes of the Book of Mormon - themes like faith, miracles, pride, courage, tradition and oaths; 2) provide an enjoyable experience for individuals who are not Mormon where they too can explore those same themes in a setting inspired by Mormon scripture; 3) create a new setting that reflects the unique cultural ideas of the Book of Mormon without relying on cultural appropriation.<br/><br/>For those reasons I\u2019m leaving most doctrinal issues at the door, offering alternatives for dealing with the religious and supernatural in the game, and embracing fiction while considering, as always, where my own faith and lived experiences inform my gaming.<br/><br/>Setting:<br/><br/>I do not advocate quoting Wikipedia\u2026 however, I\u2019m going to. From the page Proposed Book of Mormon Geographical Setting: \u201cIt is difficult to discuss the setting of The Book of Mormon without suggesting that the book itself is either historical and set in real-world geography, or to suggest that the book is fiction. Either assumption carries profound implications for the claims of Joseph Smith, Jr. and the religion[s] he founded. However, to Latter Day Saints, the book is regarded as a historical record of sacred scripture.\u201d<br/><br/>We are not discussing Book of Mormon geography, though, and instead will focus on the setting of Promised Land, a setting that is entirely fictitious. <br/><br/><br/>The Promised Land. This miraculous land was promised to your ancestors because of their righteousness as a refuge from the wicked people they had dwelt among. At least that is what the traditions say. They could have fled from the great confusion of languages at the Tower of Babel, the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians, an unnamed disaster, or the general depravity of their ancestral people.<br/><br/>The Promised Land is a stylized portrayal of the Americas, and the group should decide on a general geographic feel for the game. Is it the lush and verdant rain tropics? The harsh and unyielding desert? The verdant and seasonally changing forests? The abundant and storm wracked coastline?<br/><br/>Regardless, these assumptions are in place. Take time as a group to describe what they mean for your particular setting.<br/><br/>The game occurs around 0AD, give or take 1,000 years. The time is not as important as the image this conveys.<br/>After arriving to The Promised Land your people developed into a mighty kingdom. <br/>Your kingdom was not the first to arise here, many have come and gone.<br/>Cities have been built, by you or others.<br/>While both Kings and Prophets has ruled in the past, a government ruled by elected Judges is currently in power.<br/>A fair amount of cultural excahnge can be expected to have taken place for this small kingdom of yours. Don\u2019t fret about combining \u201cold world\u201d and \u201cnew world\u201d (and other) thoughts, items, legends, scripture, technology,  and myth.<br/><br/>A separate set of assumptions are in place in regards to Faith and Religion.<br/><br/>There is a true God, or Divine entity, who interacts directly with his faithful followers<br/>Miracles occur, but those without Faith often misinterpret these events as natural, or even evil, phenomena. Miracles rarely convert.<br/>An evil force, in opposition to God, can mirror the effects of God\u2019s power<br/><br/>As much as your group desires, you may pinpoint the nature of God in your game. You may determine an alternative title or description. You may also discuss whether there is one religion in your setting, whether all religions gain blessings from the same divine beings, or if other gods are actually deceptions from the evil force. Or you may choose to leave these details ambiguous, possibly to be decided on later.<br/><br/><br/>Character Archetypes:<br/><br/>Each of the following Archetypes currently have a description. <br/><br/>King - your fathers once rules a mighty city, tribe, or kingdom. Your ancestral home has eroded and your people have thinned, but you still lead them as their rightful ruler.<br/><br/>Judge - you were elected by the people to protect them from kings and priests alike.<br/><br/>Robber - you were once a part of a secret combination, your membership in that shadowy brotherhood is strained at the moment but you still benefit from its secret knowledge.<br/><br/>Seer - you look to the great prophets of old as your example, but you serve in an age with a scattered church and a wicked people.<br/><br/>Missionary - you have accepted the Word and have heeded a call to spread it to your brothers and sisters across the land.<br/><br/>Captain - you have taken charge of your fighting band, they swear allegiance to you and you do the same towards them.<br/><br/>Warrior- you are fierce, brave, and deadly. Whether or not its smart, you are undeterred by daunting circumstances and unfavorable odds.<br/><br/>Lost Tribe- your people was once mighty, and now you are the only one left.<br/><br/>Character Traits:<br/><br/>The Following are the traits that all PCs have. Note there are two names for each trait, as I\u2019m unsure which I prefer.<br/><br/>Light/Spirit - the strength of an individual's relationship with God<br/>Body/Strength - Physical Prowess and Combat<br/>Blood/Courage - Force of will, conviction<br/>Guile/Whisper - manipulative prowess                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423077/#Comment_423077" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-17T17:00:39+00:00" title="October 17, 2013  5:00PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.

What is the game <b>about</b>? It's hard to tell, because there's so many moves for different situations. If I were to pare it down, I'd do it thusly...<br/><br/>Call for Divine Aid<br/>Discern the Situation<br/>Act Despite Tribulation<br/>Hold Ground<br/>Strike Down<br/>Rebuke With Truth<br/><br/>One of the appeals of the Apocalypse World engine, at least for me, is that it's deliberately limited. You don't have specific moves for a lot of situations, and so you have to use the move that's the closest. This comes out particularly strongly in Monsterhearts, where the moves are deliberately blunt and messy; getting your way means using the crude tools at your disposal, and this only starts to change when you get access to Growing Up Moves.<br/><br/>So here, I would say that you ought to restrict your basic moves, using them to anchor the idea that characters think of the world and its situations in very particular ways. (For instance, I'd use Rebuke With Truth for the negotiating/convincing move, because it says something very particular about a character. A lot of the moves I called out suggest a sort of divine backing/authority behind your actions, which is very important to characters in this game.)<br/><br/>Just a few thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NYpurdy" title="NYpurdy"><img alt="NYpurdy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/806/nOF4TMGUDI1JH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NYpurdy">NYpurdy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423217/#Comment_423217" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-20T19:32:44+00:00" title="October 20, 2013  7:32PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you so much!

Especially when those things yield distinct results.<br/><br/>Another example: using Strike Down as the aggressive move. <b>That</b> says a lot about characters--you really don't have a lot of ability to hold back or be gentle about things.

Rough drafts, of course. There is still bloat in the amount of options some of these encompass, but I'm letting it stew for a while.<br/><br/><br/><b>Call for Divine Aid.</b> When you take time to call upon a higher power for divine help, or profane assistance, roll+Spirit. On a 10+, your cry is heard. If you are willing to make an Oath [divine], gain your desire by Choosing 2; otherwise choose 1. On a 7-9, you gain assistance. Choose 1 and the GM chooses 1. *Knowledge flows from on high *A Small Miracle * A beneficial Turn of Events *Help from an unexpected source *All parties are benefited *The result is confusing *The benefit is obvious * the result is ignored by others *the blessing is temporary *There are unexpected consequences<br/><br/><b>Discern the Situation. </b>When you study a situation and apply your wits or intuition, roll+Guile. On a 10+, ask a question about the situation and recieve an honest answer from the GM. On a 7-9, the GM tells you something interesting or unexpected about the situation of her choice.<br/><br/><b>Act Despite Tribulation.</b> When you act despite a significant obstacle or threat, roll+Blood. On a 10+, accomplish what you intended to do. On a 7-9, the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.<br/><br/><b>Hold Ground.</b> When you defend or brace yourself against a physical force, roll+Body. On a 10+, choose 3.. On a 7-9, choose 1. *Deflect the Blow. *Retaliate with Harm *Maintain your Stance *Protect something Precious<br/><br/><b>Strike Down.</b> When you strike with the intent to disarm, harm, or kill, roll+Body. On a 10+, you achieve your aim. On a 7-9, your blow lands, but choose one. *They deal harm in return *You're in a vulnerable position *Your intent is thwarted<br/><br/><b>Rebuke with Truth. </b>When you attempt to influence another by bolding declaring truth, roll+Blood. On a 10+, they are moved by your words and their hearts are softened by their truth. On a 7-9, they hear your words, make an Oath with them or choose 1. *They are moved *They mean you no ill or harm<br/><br/><b>Support/Sabotage.</b> When you help or interfere with another character's roll, roll+Oath. On a 10+, add +1 to the roll if supporting or subtract -1 to the roll if sabotaging.
