It has been proven time and again over the last decade that the paying audience for rpg products is not only heterogenous, but also wealthy and capable of financing the things that interest them. Any product with static cost of entry fails in that its price is inevitably too high for those who are not interested, yet unnecessarily low for those for whom the product is the best thing out there. This latter audience will gladly pay more for more. It would not be amiss to say that the supplement treadmill is an artistically failed attempt at a commercial solution that enables your core audience to give you more money than those customers who in hindsight are not that interested.<br/><br/>(One could also argue that high-end luxury product has done consistently well in the rpg market, managing to spark the jaded interest of utterly cynical gamers over and over again. However, having <i>only</i> an expensive entry seems like something that would work best with an already existing audience; with a new product you should have some low-cost interactive material for your audience to convince them that this is something they want to spend money on.)<br/><br/>In short: yes, if you can and care to produce extra value, and you offer it with similar distribution as the core product, I would expect that you would find such extra value products worthwhile. The people who are truly excited by your game will thank you for the extra effort.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354378/#Comment_354378" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-15T16:37:45+00:00" title="January 15, 2012  4:37PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 15, 2012 5:43PM by Ross_Cowman.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hans c-o</cite>$10 isn't too much for the right PDF (it's juuuuust on my high pricepoint edge), but it is too much for a "check out and see PDF."</blockquote>\nhow about $9.99?

The time involved in just printing or finding someone to print for you is something better done by a publisher and not an end user.<br/><br/>What do people use pdf's for? Mostly I would say they are an excuse to not buy the real thing but still feel less bad about not ever playing the games they own. The unused game sits conveintely hidden in a file folder it is not a physical book on a shelf that says "hey you buy a whole lot of these books and never play them".<br/><br/>I'm sure some people use PDF's as a method to check out a book and see if it's worth picking up a physical copy, i think free preview chapters in as a PDF is great. i think getting reviews from podcasts or web sites is also great.<br/><br/>This assumes your product is best when printed. if your doing something to really make the digital formats work for you as a product them do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354407/#Comment_354407" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-15T19:57:38+00:00" title="January 15, 2012  7:57PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking a lot about limited edition games because some of my most interesting game concepts probably have a rather limited audience, due to both interest and the necessity of certain physical components.<br/><br/>Examples!<br/><br/>I bought a copy of Cunningham &amp; Venezky's <a href="http://www.coolhunting.com/design/diaspora.php" rel="nofollow">Diaspora playing cards</a> a few years back, which describe humans abandoning civilization and animals slowly taking over the cities.  There are only 300 decks in existence and maybe only a few owned by members of the indie games community (because a link to it was posted on SG a while back).  So if I design a game that uses the deck, it would be a very limited-edition thing, only playable with people who owned a copy of the deck.  Could be a big hit at conventions, since it might be your only chance to play it!  But not very effective as a commercial product for the masses.<br/><br/>Another thought: my game <a href="http://corvidsun.com/2011/11/05/metrofinal-beta-released/" rel="nofollow">Metrofinal</a> is really crazy and weird, but the components are really difficult to produce in a way that makes them reusable.  Players have to be able to draw on the game board and write on the components, but -- unlike Risk Legacy or something -- it's a single session game, not a campaign-length experience.  So either I produce components as pads of sheets in a boxed set -- sorta like Luke and Jared did with Freemarket -- or I produce the game in packets of printed products that you dispose of afterwards: you'd effectively purchase the material for playing the game once and would have to buy a new set to play again. Maybe you destroy the components in a ritual fashion afterwards? Still pondering that. Maybe it just shouldn't be turned into a commercial product at all.<br/><br/>Lastly, I own two copies of Hodge &amp; Wright's landmark photographs of the Small Magellanic Cloud, which are 11x11" cardboard prints in a box of 200+ sheets. These will eventually be crucial components for playing <i>Fingers on the Firmament</i>, where players will draw on the star photos to make maps of space.  There's probably a limit to how many copies of the game I can hand-assemble from used copies of Hodge &amp; Wright's prints. Plus, the 11x11" dimensions are going to make them really hard to ship or do much else with.  So maybe I'll make 20-50 copies and that's all the copies that will ever exist.<br/><br/>I realize that many designers feel a natural desire for their games to be played by as many people as possible, but sometimes an experience can be more special, intimate, and valuable if it is extremely limited and special.  And, as indie designers, we're not dependent on selling a bunch of games for our livelihood, like the folks at WOTC or even Green Ronin.

Walton<br/>\nAnother thought: my gameMetrofinalis really crazy and weird, but the components are really difficult to produce in a way that makes them reusable.  Players have to be able to draw on the game board and write on the components, but -- unlike Risk Legacy or something -- it's a single session game, not a campaign-length experience.  So either I produce components as pads of sheets in a boxed set -- sorta like Luke and Jared did with Freemarket -- or I produce the game in packets of printed products that you dispose of afterwards: you'd effectively purchase the material for playing the game once and would have to buy a new set to play again. Maybe you destroy the components in a ritual fashion afterwards? Still pondering that. Maybe it just shouldn't be turned into a commercial product at all.<br/>\n.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would make it a definite no-buy for me. I'd be forever waiting for just that one right time to play the game, thus never playing it at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354452/#Comment_354452" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-16T07:39:50+00:00" title="January 16, 2012  7:39AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite>If someone is really good at this (the packaging bit) and can make reasonable prices, it sounds like he could serve the whole industry as an add-on service, catering for the luxury high-end.</blockquote>\nDave Dobson (creator of Snood and a number of board and card games) <a href="http://planktongames.blogspot.com/search/label/Publishing" rel="nofollow">posts quite a bit about costs of publishing</a> and so on, using places like <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/" rel="nofollow">The Game Crafter</a> or <a href="http://www.adventuregamesource.com/" rel="nofollow">Adventure Game Source</a> (formerly SuperiodPOD).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354468/#Comment_354468" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-16T10:00:21+00:00" title="January 16, 2012 10:00AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>To clarify my question, I was asking, "Why, as a businessperson, do you want to offer a discount for an upgrade?"

But if you do this, you're missing an opportunity to make <em>several</em> customers happy.

You end up taking in less cash <em>per PDF sold,</em> but you're creating many more opportunities for PDF discounts, which push your file into the impulse-buy range, and ultimately this might get your game into the hands of more people.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354492/#Comment_354492" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-16T12:56:57+00:00" title="January 16, 2012 12:56PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only problem there is the growing number of games that offer free versions of the PDF when you buy the paper copy, even when the paper copy is <i>not</i> especially "chromed out."

Production costs increase, obviously, but so do shipping costs and loss from damaged goods. Nail everything down and make sure it makes sense. If it does, price it accordingly and give the PDF to the buyers for free. It costs you effectively nothing, is a gesture of trust and goodwill toward your very best customers and advocates, and gives them ultimate flexibility in how they learn and use your game. Make it available at an appropriate price for anyone who else who wants it, like the legions of cheap DIY nerds.<br/><br/>To address your question as a consumer, I am not willing to pay for "play out of the box" convenience if it means I'm getting stuff I already have. I don't want dice, blank padded paper, glass beads, poker chips, pencils, etc. If your game uses custom cards, I'd love to have really nice ones I don't have to make, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354537/#Comment_354537" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-16T16:58:47+00:00" title="January 16, 2012  4:58PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason has some very good points. my other point would be to use kickstarter to do any of this, no reason to risk your cash if there is no demand for the product.<br/><br/>I also really like the folder idea over a box, basically if it does not fit in a folder than people are likely to already have it. folders also ship much easier. i would love to see a book and folder that were matching sizes and could easily be carried and shelved together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354582/#Comment_354582" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-17T03:55:45+00:00" title="January 17, 2012  3:55AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you offering <i>a game you can play out of the box</i> or <i>a chromed-out game with lots of extras</i>?

It worked well for Freemarket, too.<br/><br/>If you're offering practicality, then I'm only interested if your game uses very specific things. For example: the counters in Freemarket, the cards in Shab Al-Hiri Roach.\n<blockquote>Would buying the $10 pdf get you $5 off the chromed-out boxed set?</blockquote>\nI offered something similar for A Taste For Murder.
