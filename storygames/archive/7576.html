I've never understood the "you can't develop character in one session" argument.  Do characters not get developed in movies, single novels, plays or short stories?  Sam Spade, one of the most iconic characters in history, ONLY appears in The Maltese Falcon and there's no more than a session or twos worth of scenes in that story.  One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a fairly short book and yet McMurphy is a rich and complex character.<br/><br/>Switching over to an actual play context, I played "It Was A Mutual Decision" once over about a three hour period.  I think Daniel and Viola will be some of my favorite characters from an RPG ever.  I think about how controlling Viola was and how defensive and lost poor Daniel was.  I remember how they couldn't escape each other and were so on the verge of getting back together that we had to kill Daniel as the only way out of the relationship.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168133/#Comment_168133" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T00:34:09+00:00" title="September 10, 2008 12:34AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Ryan/sacredchao.

Yes, there are stories in books, comics and movie where there is no character development. And you know... they usually suck. They are the movie good enough (sometimes) to pass two hours and then you forget you saw them after five minutes.  I don't know why in rpg country there is often a concept of "story" so limited to "the worst kind of story". Yes, I know that the first "stories" in rpgs were of that kind ("kill monsters and take their stuff") but there is a pervasive idea around that "these are the only kind of stories that you can do in rpg" that is, simply, bollocks.<br/><br/>In GOOD stories, you always have character development. Even in a short story.<br/><br/>You use as an example My Life With Master.  Well, even if played for a one-shot (not the best way to play it), HOW can you play a game of My Life with master without (1) a complete story with drama, betrayals, horrors revealed and a big fight at the end, and (2) characters that develop and change during the game, finding love and in that love the strength to defy the master? The game is build in a way that you really simply can't avoid doing both during play...<br/><br/>So, I think there is some disconnection in the meaning of the word used: what is that you see missing in your one-shot of My Life With Master?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168153/#Comment_168153" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T04:53:27+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  4:53AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite><br/>In GOOD stories, you always have character development.

Movies, books, comics, etc, use a bunch of tools that gamers either don't have access to or don't how to use, like internal monologues, a soundtrack (appropriate music during a certain scene can tell us a ton about a character without interrupting dialogue, etc), first-person description ("I shook at the thought of meeting John again, here in this store, where the floor was the colour of my vomit after that night we'd shared...") which brings the scenes to life <i>and</i> develops character at the same time, and so on. In a film, while someone is talking or something is happening, the facial expressions of other characters, camera angles, etc, can simultaneously deliver a lot of emotionally relevant content. In an RPG, most of the time those reactions would be described or acted out separately, taking more time.<br/><br/>A short story that's only a few pages long can deliver a lot of info about one character if every word of those few pages is written with that goal in mind. Roleplayers don't always get the focus right away or know how to deliver that information.<br/><br/>Perhaps most importantly, RPGs typically don't have an <i>editor</i>, who can remove all the stuff that <i>doesn't</i> develop character.<br/><br/>...I'm not saying this is impossible; quite the contrary.

Bring it.  But stumbling about in a loose mechanic isn't the same as generating story.  and from an audience pov, i'm much more interested in where the characters plug into the story with their idiosyncrasies than i am in enduring a tour of histrionics. <br/><br/>i can't pretend to be a master author here, but i get different experiences from types of play that set up character driven vs. story driven.  and as ptevis indicates above, the likely outcome is that unless you're whipping the character the rest is derided as narration.  At present i see people placing arguments for either style of play but not for both.  That praxis seems to be the sweet spot to me.  I'm frustrated that the recent crop of games is so decisive and not as muddled as i am.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169913/#Comment_169913" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T12:58:45+00:00" title="September 18, 2008 12:58PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to keep notes here for myself (*note to self, no more drunken posts including the word "praxis")...<br/><br/>I like to think that what i'm struggling with here is very similar to the conversation that happens between Paul Tevis and Robin D. Laws on "The Voice of the Revolution" Episode 22.  This particular discussion is still one of my favorite podcast segments of the past few months.<br/><br/>things covered: Creativity and it's relationship to Structure;  Robin discusses the story arc in Beowulf (and parallels in contemporary screenwriting); Story points of success and failure vs. rp's mechanical uncertainties;  and facilitating story vs imposing story. <br/><br/>It's with Paul's summation that the destination is to create story with arcs rather than play that creates chaos that i'm finding mirrors in my questions about a: story is the stuff that happens, and b: whether or not both story and character can be generated in a short run. Can you reward improv and create way points?  <br/><br/>Jason's Grey Ranks seems to reward character and story in the dual scene structure.  I wonder if there are other ways of doing that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169920/#Comment_169920" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-18T13:48:38+00:00" title="September 18, 2008  1:48PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, you've hooked me back in.<br/><br/>Here's something I'm not clear on: When you say "character development" and "story," what do you mean?

With regard to that broadcast, i have one question: between your recap of Laws' points and the few minutes that follow it almost sounds like the conversation does a 180, where Laws ends with a defense of improv in story games (vs. say, imposing a story)?  i've listened to that interview a few times now and i haven't been able to reconcile that.  I'd love to get your take on it.<br/><br/>To get back to the core of this for me, the question is about how to expand play in two directions at once in a short form game (single session-ish).  This is spurred on by something that i'm working on.  Most the short games i've played, read or observed seem to indicate a strong preference for either story or character development in the mechanics of the rules, eg. my interpretation of Jason's two recent games would be that "the Roach" is a story building game and that "Grey Ranks" is a character building game. The Roach supports building in and around scene structure from act to act; where Grey Ranks has a strong, martial historical structure and mechanics that drive character depth.<br/><br/>I think you're able to get some degree of both in a good short form game but haven't seen anything that specifically addresses this type of framing and or issue.  So, I'm sort of curious if it's only a problem i've invented or if it's really there.  I'd thought i'd seen some support for it in the Laws' interview.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173096/#Comment_173096" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-03T21:37:57+00:00" title="October  3, 2008  9:37PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just out of curiosity, if you have a game that goes something like:<br/><br/>You have a character.

I'm only just into my first PtA game where maybe it does a pretty balanced job of story and char dev, however it's a 5 to 9 evening game.  so the question i ask myself is: are there any equivalents in shorter games?  <br/><br/>for example, what if you were playing Roach and there are turning points in the narrative where you have to realign your dice and affinities based on previous play?  So that as you lose your job as professor you have to take up a different dice pool as soda jerk off campus?  The char dev in 3:16 happens in longer play with the exercise of your strengths and weaknesses but what if you had to trip those wires a number of times during play in an evening rather than carpet bomb the planet with your get-out-of-jail free card?  <br/><br/>i haven't had a chance to look at Full Light Full Steam yet but would like to see how the battery charging works over the course of an evening of play.  another good example of this, though i didn't see it manifest in actual play, are the exhausted traits in Misspent Youth.  those markers in Misspent Youth got buried in the story chase, when i feel they may have more to do with the heart of the game than my experience with the system lead to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173231/#Comment_173231" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-04T11:55:46+00:00" title="October  4, 2008 11:55AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm, I'll think on this some more, but, for now, add me to the group of people who "don't see the difference". <br/><br/>If you think of any other ways to express this, please post!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_173233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173233/#Comment_173233" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-04T11:57:36+00:00" title="October  4, 2008 11:57AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            right.  back to pounding my head on the desk.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173237/#Comment_173237" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-04T12:05:50+00:00" title="October  4, 2008 12:05PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well... maybe I should say:<br/><br/>I don't see the difference in ideal play. In practice, I can imagine forcefully separating the two (kind of like how you're supposed to do that with scenes in PTA--those of you who play regularly, does that actually work? Or do your plot scenes end up developing character and vice versa?). There's definitely a distinction _in design_, though. Many Keys are more about "character", in a sense, and things like The Horror Revealed or whatever might be more about "story". But it also seems that, in a good game, the two wouldn't feel so cut and dry: the story would be about the Keys, and the Horror would be relevant to the characters' passions somehow.<br/><br/>I feel like I'm squinting at it, though. I'm not even sure I could identify one versus the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
