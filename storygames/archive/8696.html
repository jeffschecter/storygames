Situations that facilitate addressing premise.<br/><br/>What kinds of situations do you want in Gamist play?  Situations that provide challenges.<br/><br/>What kinds of situations do you want in Sim play?  Situations that facilitate meaningful contribution to the SIS.  (For anyone who dislikes "SIS", just translate to "fiction".)<br/><br/>"Meaningful contributions"?  Gack.  That needs some serious work to be a useful reference point.  <br/><br/>"Contributions" are limited by the tools at the players' disposal.  For example, in many "traditional" Sim-supporting RPGs, a player's only tool is description/portrayal of his character's speech and action.<br/><br/>"Meaningful" is determined by the priorities of a given play group as regards their "dream".  These priorities differ so vastly across different groups that the internet is littered with the wreckage of "what Sim is/isn't" discussions.  I'm going to throw out an example, and it's going to be way different than the kind of Sim many (most?) readers like.  This is where the conversation often ends.  All I can say is that after I'm done with the specifics, I think I can work back to the general, at least in regard to the thread's topic: role of situation.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192357/#Comment_192357" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-12T16:45:24+00:00" title="February 12, 2009  4:45PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, my example:<br/><br/>Play Group F wants to play Firefly, the TV show.  But not exactly.  They want to play THEIR Firefly.  <br/><br/>Group F is playing with a "traditional" set of contribution tools, as I described above.<br/><br/>"Meaningful contributions" come in a few flavors here.  Some types of input that are highy valued by Group F include:<br/><br/><b>1)</b> Using not-exactly-from-the-show ingredients to produce very show-like outcomes.  <i>My character is a former pirate who hates order, government, and etiquette, and lives by his own strict code of honor.  This is quite different from the show character Mal, who is a bitter ex-soldier.  However, both men will be rude to you and then risk their lives to save you from evil.</i><br/><br/>GM does this by creating setting that is Firefly-appropriate, but not copied.<br/><br/>Players do this by using their characters to do things that are Firefly-appropriate, but not copied.<br/><br/><b>2) </b>Manipulating show ingredients to produce novel outcomes, thus expanding the breadth of the central concept.  <i>What happens if the scumbags that the protagonists killed to save the prostitutes were the last obstruction to that new settlement movement we heard about?  All of a sudden, our heroes are looked to as the leaders and lawmen of this corner of the frontier!</i><br/><br/>GM does this by combining Firefly-appropriate (copied or not) setting features to produce situations that are unfamiliar (i.e. never addressed by the show).<br/><br/>Players do this by opearting along the spectrum from (a) doing Firefly-appropriate things in unfamliar situations, to (b) interacting with Firefly-appropriate setting features in unfamiliar ways.<br/><br/><i>(b) is the classic Sim-nerd example, and seems quite popular, historically.  "Will the ship still fly if we fill it with water?  What will a Reaver do if we stick it in a cage?"</i><br/><br/><b>3)</b> Dropping truly novel elements into the show, forcing the central concept to twist to accommodate them. <i>My "Jayne" character kills your "Mal" character!  Suddenly, the Firefly experience just became more savage and tragic.</i><br/><br/>GM does this by introducing strongly non-Firefly-appropriate setting elements.<br/><br/>Players do this with strongly non-Firefly-appropriate character behavior.<br/><br/>I think that's enough for now.<br/><br/>Remember, this is just Group F.  Group G is also getting their Firefly on, and loves (1) and (2), but abhors (3).<br/><br/><b>So, what kinds of situations are going to best facilitate such contributions?</b><br/><br/>Well, I think we'd need some foundation:<br/>A) Reasons for the PCs to stay together and interact.<br/><img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> Dramatic story arcs, with conflicts over prizes to be won and dire fates to be avoided.<br/><br/>And, based on that, one specific possibility leaps to mind:<br/>C) Conflicts that players can win or lose via particularly Firefly-appropriate or not-Firefly-appropriate character actions<br/><br/>I gotta run, but I'll return later.

So what are the properties of a good stage?<br/><br/>I think perhaps we need some reliable structures in the background (e.g. cooperation and a story arc w/ conflict), some aesthetic consonance in the midground (e.g. Firefly-appropriate setting color), and some aesthetic consonance and dissonance (caged Reaver! dead protagonist! townsfolk looking for authority!) in the most strongly interactive, foreground stuff.<br/><br/>Let's get some more thoughts on good Situation/stage properties.  Once we've maxed that out, then we can turn to how to design such properties into play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192411/#Comment_192411" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-13T01:42:25+00:00" title="February 13, 2009  1:42AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, still not right. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  Situation isn't the stage, it's the entire theater production before the curtain rises \u2014 sure, it's the set on stage, but it's also the characters, and it's also the relationships they begin play with.

A lot of the setting and situation might be served up by the GM in a Sim game, and the role of the players is to validate it (constructive denial). Then again, the classic Sim GM line "What do you do?" asks players for input that generates situation. <br/><br/>What do you have your character do? What situation would you like to be in? The GM reinforces the Sim CA by filtering their oft-implicit desires through the lens of the setting. You may not get the situation you wanted, but what you do get is reinforcement of setting, and that pushes your Sim buttons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192472">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192472/#Comment_192472" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-13T11:02:10+00:00" title="February 13, 2009 11:02AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, sure.

The contrast of Jayne killing Mal is interesting because we have a good idea of how Jayne and Mal should normally interact.  To be "well understood" the interactions probably need to already be presented in a way that contrasts with normal expectations (e.g., psychic scientists decapitating dinosaurs) or with other interactions contiguous to the situation (e.g. interactions between Jayne and Mal vs. interactions vs.  the interactions between particular other pair of characters.)  All in all, there needs to be a lot of broken symmetry.  So maybe... 1) for each pair of interactions (not elements), there should be a significant property which they share and which no other interaction in the situation has, and 2) for each pair of interactions, there should be a significant property for which they are asymmetrical and for which no other interaction is asymmetrical.  If you call the conjunction of these two properties a...I don't know, a Conjuction, then you might also say that a good situation as both high number of Conjunctions <i>and</i> and high number of Conjunctions per element.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192489/#Comment_192489" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-13T12:43:24+00:00" title="February 13, 2009 12:43PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jarod, <br/><br/>I (gently) reject the notion that Sim requires anything in the setting or characters to be "well understood." Often the joy of Sim play is discovery during play or being surprised by play. Maybe you had no idea that Mal would push the guy out of the hatch to his death, but when it happened, you grinned widely and nodded and thought, <i>of course he did.</i> That's Sim.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just not understanding your point, though.<br/><br/><br/>David,<br/><br/><i>Validation</i> is, to me, the slightly younger twin of <i>rejection</i>. Both serve powerful purposes in Sim play. I think a lot of rejection happens at the table, even if it isn't "in your face" arguing or nay-saying. It's probably more often negotiation, pointed questions, and counter-proposals. <br/><br/>Mal to Thug 1: "If I let you go, will you leave me alone?"<br/>Thug 1: "Never! I'll follow you to the ends of the earth to kill you."<br/>Mal throws Thug 1 out of the hatch to his death.<br/>Mal to Thug 2: "If I let you go, will you leave me alone?"<br/>Thug 2: "Um. Yes."<br/><br/>Imagine that the GM, playing the thugs, stops after Mal's player says, "I'm gonna push the smart-ass thug out of the hatch." The GM might raise an eyebrow, or say, "Really? To his death?" That's a queue to the player to explain his (or Mal's) reasoning or motivation. "Mal's a cold sonofabitch."

What I'm trying to get at is that there must be some foundation on which to make the realization "<i>of course he did</i>", and that foundation comes from...being acquainted with?...Mal's interactions that are largely symmetrical to this one.  Incidentally, you've provided a counterexample to the idea that all interactions are better if the symmetry is somewhere broken.  Satisfaction may come from a sudden realization that the situation <i>isn't</i> as novel as it initially appeared.  (Of course, I guess that gets us into degree of brokenness.)  Broken symmetry is useful if we want the reaction to be "<i>oh no he di'in't</i>".  But all there really needs to be for arousal is tension between whether or not the symmetry will be broken.  And maybe sometimes arousal isn't even what we're going for.  So all I can really say is that symmetry is useful <i>somehow</i>, and that breaking symmetry can serve to make a situation stand out by making its interactions stand out.  But I still think this is core to what makes or breaks all sim situations alike.  It seems like anything else will be dependent on the individuals that make up the play group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192531/#Comment_192531" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-13T19:09:02+00:00" title="February 13, 2009  7:09PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience, unexpected discoveries like that rely at least in part on trust. If one person "sees it" and another person is somewhat dumbfounded, you have to be able to put your trust in someone to say "no really, he WOULD do that", whether it's a GM or the player of a character or whoever. If you can buy into the trust - that person's vision of that part of the situation - then you don't necessarily need to buy into every single part of the evolving situation.

Could I go back to some individual examples?<br/><br/>If we're playing Firefly, we'll create a set of characters who are <i>broadly</i> aligned and overtly friendly, but with antipathies and sympathies between characters. If we're playing Vampire, we'll create a set of characters who put on a show of alignment, but are secretly opposed and working against each other. <br/><br/>Basically, we'll set up situations like the ones in the world we're trying to emulate. I'm not sure there's much to say beyond that. <br/><br/>I'm unconvinced, actually, that Situation is a useful concept to use when considering Simulationism. In my opinion, the Big Model is basically geared towards Nar: it understands Gamism less and Simulation even less than that. Situation is a term that's very useful in Nar play, but, I think, less useful when thinking about Sim.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192553/#Comment_192553" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-14T06:25:14+00:00" title="February 14, 2009  6:25AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nah, Graham, Situation is crucial for Dream.

For those who haven't read my rants on the subject...most everything GNS describes as Simulation is really Exploration.  Rename the essay the "What is Exploration" essay and do a find and replace for Exploration for Simulationism and I'd be like "yeah, that essay is spot on" rather than "no, that essay is so far off the mark its silly".  The Right to Dream is utter bullshit as a tag line for sim play.  Its a great tag line for Exploration play.  The Right to Enjoy Watching Things Develop Organically Without Being Fucked With is a better tag line for Sim play...though not as catchy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I've gone to some lengths to describe what Simulationism in GNS is really about elsewhere, so I'll just say here that Situation in Sim is extremely important in two parts.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart One is the initial set up.  Like a science experiment it is the sum total of all of the starting conditions of play.  Here is the cast of characters, here is what they want, here is where each of them are in their plans, here is what unrelated stuff is going on over there, etc. etc.  Depending on how broad the initial set up is this could be broad strokes on a national or continental scale or individual details for individual people in a single village.  You can't have sim without this, and good sim play spends alot of time trying to get this right.  Back when there was still a chance to define Sim properly in GNS there were a number of good discussions where this practice was called "front loading premise".  As I recall John Kim had a lot to say about setting up a campaign in this fashion.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart Two is even MORE important.  It is the single most important defining feature of Sim play and it is not to be fucked with.  It is this:  Don't EVER tweak the situation again...EVER.  From here on out every change to the situation MUST develop organically through play without any interference to make it go a certain direction.  In hard core play (and IME the sim agenda has a tendency to drift more towards the hard core version than other agenda) NO exceptions are tolerated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis touches upon recent discussions of why Bangs don't work in Sim play.  Why Meta level play is generally avoided like the plague in Sim play (although I have seen effective exceptions), and why Sim play often gets tangled up in "Immersion" which is a seperate phenomenon that is easy to drag in because offers a more pat explanation for what is going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is the role of situation in Sim play...true sim play.  The role of situation in Exploration Play is different...much of what has been said in this thread I would consider accurate in relation to Exploration Play but not necessarily for Sim.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the curious, no I don't consider Exploration a Fourth Creative Agenda.  I consider it a foundation for all of the Creative Agenda (as in the Big Model) and so elements of the Right to Dream can be seen across any of the Agenda.  Where I differ from the Big Model is that I think people can play at the Exploration Level without ever taking on an additional Creative Agenda at all.  Each Agenda is "Exploration plus this other stuff".  I think its entirely possible to play as "Exploration without any other stuff".<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I think THAT sort of play is not only possible but really darn common and accounts nicely for the number of people who will argue that their group is a hybrid of agendae.  I think it is very common to have one or more players in any group who just grooves on the Exploration and doesn't give a rip about the rest of the stuff but who doesn't oppose the rest of the stuff either.  So while the rest of the group is getting their Gam or Nar on...these players are just happily bumping along enjoying the Color / System / Situation / Character / Setting.  Pulling their weight to support the others agendae when necessary, but not really concerned with it on any level deeper than "it makes their friends happy if they do it that way".<br/>\n<br/>\n/rant                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192592/#Comment_192592" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-14T12:12:02+00:00" title="February 14, 2009 12:12PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 14, 2009 12:12PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph,<br><br>I think there are some interesting lessons from, and limits on, "don't ever deliberately tweak situation once play starts."<br><br>For the purposes of this thread, can you humor me when I lazily write "Sim" instead of "Exploration which may or may not be Sim"?<br><br>Or, we could just have a good old-fashioned "what is Sim?" argument in another thread.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>To whoever else is interested: PLEASE DO NOT HAVE THAT ARGUMENT HERE!!!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192593/#Comment_192593" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-14T12:13:08+00:00" title="February 14, 2009 12:13PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>"don't ever deliberately tweak situation once play starts."</blockquote>\nNot that I particularly believe in either one, but check out GDS simulationism for something similar along these lines. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192594/#Comment_192594" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-14T12:40:30+00:00" title="February 14, 2009 12:40PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, Group F finishes one Firefly mission.  The characters complete a job and get paid, and everyone enjoyed the GM's colorful descriptions and the players' witty in-character banter.  The play session ends.  What happens next?<br><br>Well, in Group G, the group would have an open chat about "what would be fun to do next".  One player might say, "What if the government caught up to us?" and the GM might say, "Yes!  It shall be so!"<br><br>And, in Group H, everyone might show up to the next session having done no prep, and the GM might start with, "So, what do you all do?"  And the players in Group H, working from whatever situation was established before the game started, modified by whatever changes play has wrought to date (e.g. "now we have more money and friends!"), will say, "We go to the salt mine!" or soemthing.<br><br>However, Group F does something different.  They find that Group G's approach breaks their dream ("Oh.  The govt showed up.  Didn't see that coming.").  They find that Group H's approach leaves them floundering ("Last time we just picked something, it turned out to be boring.  There was no dramatic situation to impact, no obstacles to overcome, and we burned through the new 'Firefly salt mine' color in 30 minutes.")  So what Group F does is this:<br><br>They discuss in-character what to do next.  They pick something (salt mine).  Then the session ends, and the GM goes home and preps the salt mine.  When they reassemble to play through the salt mine, they arrive to find it full of conflict and drama.  Just like in the show!  The conflict and drama gives them a way to get themselves into Firefly-ish moments, which inspires everyone's best Firefly-ish contributions.<br/><br/>So, what did the GM prep?  This is what Mark W. was talking about.  The GM's job is to prime the character relationships to the setting and color they're about to encounter as best he can.  So what does "best" mean?  Answering that is the purpose of this thread.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
