If your <b>trade</b> applies, start with one die (if not, you\u2019ll need to tap your threat score twice, giving you two dice, one of which is a penalty die). If you have any <b>tools</b> that can help, add one die to the pool. Any <b>trademarks</b> you can use are added as bonus dice (keep in mind the \u2018rule of six\u2019 which means you can not throw more than six dice at any one time). <b>Troubles</b> will hinder you, turning a die into penalty die for any you have at the time. You can <b>tap</b> your <b>threat</b> score to remove a rouble. Every tear sheet comes with its own set of <b>trumps</b>, which you can <b>tag</b> to break the rules. <b>Tolls</b> work in the opposite way and appear as a flaw or costly sign.You can also tap your threat score to add dice to your pool or to assist another character (if that roll succeeds you get the point back, if it fails, your score is reduced by one until refreshed).<br/><br/>Roll the dice in your pool. Keep the highest die, unless the highest are multiples\u2014in which you keep two (additional multiples of the same number can be used to refresh your threat score, remove a trouble, or add a triumph to a successful result). If your roll is equal to or higher than the opposing threat score the action is a success.<br/><br/>I'm trying to resolve this without needing a defense score. An example follows, but I'm not sure I like it since it tweaks the mechanic a bit.<br/><br/>A guard catches a thief in the act. Instead of hauling him off to jail--he's going to put him down for good. Let's say both have a Threat of 4. Rounds are an abstract measurement of time, the exact amount of time is not important, only the rule that a character gets one rolled action per round. The action is simultaneous and may consist of a whole sequence of attacking and defensive maneuvers; it is assumed that the characters in combat are doing everything possible to avoid being hit, unless specifically stated otherwise. The pace at which combat happens is reflected by the number of defense dice you hold in reserve: the faster the pace, the lower the dice.<br/><br/>The Guard gets 1D for his trade, 1D for tools [sword], and another 1B for a trademark [breaking skulls]. He doesn't have any trumps to play yet. He's got a toll [Getting Soft and Flabby] that says after 2 rounds, he is Spent. So he's got to finish the Thief off quickly. He decides to tap his threat (lowered to 3) for another 1D, giving him a total of 4D. One of dice he will use on defense. "You're dead little man," he screams and moves in for the kill. He rolls a 5,5,4,2. He'll get the fives for a score of 10 and the 4 for his DC.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Thief has no choice but fight as there is no place to run. He'll get 1D for his trade, 1D for his tools [dagger], he doesn't have any trademarks that he can use, and he's got a trouble [Doubt] for getting caught stealing, which means he's got a 1P. No trumps or tolls are applicable. So he's looking at 3D, one of which is a penalty. He'll tap his threat for 2 (bringing him down to 2) and use 3D in defense, knowing his only chance at survival is wearing down the big guy and hoping like hell he doesn't get hit with that sword. He's got 5D (one is a penalty) to roll. "Come and get me you fat bastard", the thief says as he circles away from the guard. He rolls a 6,6,4,2,2. The penalty takes the six away and he's left with 6,4,2,2. He'll take the 6 for his DC and the 2 to hit with. <br/><br/>How does it turn out? Well not too good for the thief. He guard has a 10 on his attack, while the thief managed a 6 to counter. A difference of 4. The thief can tap his armor to reduce this by one. He can also take the trouble [Hurt] and drop the difference by another point. He's still left with a difference of 2 and his Threat score is only a 2. He decides to add a toll [Jailbird], reducing the difference to 1, to hopefully save his life. His threat score is reduced to 1 and he begs for the guard to show him mercy.<br/><br/>Now what can follow is a social combat encounter, where the thief pleads in hopes of convincing the guard not to off him right then and there.<br/><br/>Or perhaps, he can use his trump [Thick as . . .] in which, luckily, someone in the Thieves Guild happens to stumble by.<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/><br/>The other thought is to use take Threat score as a base defense and if you want to bump it up, you can burn dice in your pool. This way you are not changing the mechanic by holding dice for defense. But does it act as a simple +1 for each dice, so if you had a Threat of 4 and burned a die it would go to 5. Or do you roll that die? It's a risk you take. It could be anywhere from 5-10, depending on the roll. If I went the last route, there is a chance that the thief survives the encounter.<br/>Let's say he took one of the three dice to temporarily boost his threat score. He rolls a 6, his threat score goes to 10 for the round and he doesn't get hit. <br/><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/><br/>Looking at it, option two seems like it might work better.<br/><br/>Your thoughts please!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382390/#Comment_382390" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T00:02:55+00:00" title="June 15, 2012 12:02AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A third method, I forgot to think about. Simple opposed roll, with the higher side hitting. In case of a tie, both sides hit. Players can still spend with threat.<br/><br/>Guard rolls 4D and gets 5,5,4,2. He takes the two highest (multiples) and adds to make it a 10. The thief rolls a 6,6,4,2,2. The penalty takes the six away and he's left with 6,4,2,2 so he ends up with a 6. The difference is applied the same, but it looks much cleaner.<br/><br/>Where it can get fun is guard risking some of his own dice to get advantages <i>after</i> the roll if successful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382460/#Comment_382460" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T14:36:00+00:00" title="June 15, 2012  2:36PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This seems really overcomplex to me.
