                    I've been on a lot of boards recently and in private discussions that are all saying the same thing.  Why can't we get more women/minorities/jocks/etc. to game?<br/>
<br/>
I began to wonder this myself.  I can happily say I know a lot of gamers personally.  All but two I know, are married.  To women.  (Just putting that out there for the record!)  :D<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, all of them have stated to me "How did you start gaming?  I'd love it if my wife would game too."  My answer is, my mom introduced me to D&amp;D at a very young age.  I've been a gamer ever since.  My husband Eric, gets looked at with awe (yes genuine awe) because he's a gamer and has found himself the coveted 'gamer wife'.  (I feel like I should be wearing a tiara and a sash that says Gamer Wife whenever I walk into our local game store.)  *end snarkiness*<br/>
<br/>
I ask these same friends about why their wives aren't gamers, "Well have you asked her to play?"  They always respond with an exasperated sigh and "Yes.  But she won't do it."  When I ask why won't she I usually get the "It's not her thing" or "she doesn't think it's fun" or "she feels like she just won't get it."<br/>
<br/>
*blink*<br/>
<br/>
I'm beginning to wonder if my friends are going about it all wrong.  I personally have managed to get two of their wives to play in games and each time, both men nearly fell over at the fact that their wives played and even enjoyed it.  When I tell them "see, she'll play" they inform me it's because I was there.  Could it be that maybe I explained the game differently?  Or coudl it truly be that they saw another woman enjoying what the men in their lives enjoyed and realized they could too?<br/>
<br/>
So here's the questions ladies and gents:<br/>
<br/>
1.  For all the female gamers out there, how often do you try to get your non gamer female friends/partners/spouses to game with you?  Do you even talk about gaming with them?  I myself am in a knitting group and never mention gaming with them (and now you know I'm not quite sure why not... *ponder*), but I talk about gaming all the time at work with all the women in my office even though none of them are gamers.  I have fuzzy d20's hanging from my rear view mirror.  I have foam d6's on the desk in my office.  How do you let it be known that you are a gamer grrl?<br/>
<br/>
2.  For all you male gamers out there, how do you really ask your female companions/friends/partners/spouses?  Do you go at them like you're asking for a menage a'trois?  9i've seen it approached that way!  I really have!  "Come on baby.  You'll like it.  Really.")  Or do you tell them it would make you happy if they tried once?  Or maybe tell them it's important to you that they be included in the things you enjoy doing?  <br/>
<br/>
3.  For all the people that feel they are minorities, do you try to get any of your non gamer friends/partners/spouses to game?  How did you do it?  Did you ask?  Did you whine?  Did you pester?<br/>
<br/>
I know some people have said it's the artwork in some of the books that turns women off.  I know some people have said it's the fact that it's not as phycially engaging as other things and thus that's why outdoorsy types aren't drawn to it.  I know also that some people have said gaming is focused more one culture than another and that's why most minorities aren't drawn to it.  <br/>
<br/>
So what do you think?  Am I blowing smoke out my ass here?  Any ideas or thoughts?<br/>
<br/>

All of her guy-friends and buddies from the high school ultimate frisbee team are gaming geeks but she never quite got into it.<br/><br/>She had a bad experience with an over-controlling GM and was convinced that she was no good at it.<br/><br/>But still, she'd pick up gaming books, look at pics in the Monster Manual, listen to me go on about the games I was playing and make insightful and awesome comments.  She's read tons of fantasy fiction and we nearly got into our first fight when she wanted the third Song of Ice and Fire novel from me and I wasn't reading it fast enough.<br/><br/>But still, I waited and didn't just throw her in with any ole group.  I got together a group of people I knew she could trust and we played and it was fun.<br/><br/>Now she plays in a monthly group I play with and digs it.  With school and work, monthly is all she can fit into her schedule.<br/><br/>She is still kind of shy about it in her own way but since her BW Orc killed three men and joined the rest of the group eating one of the men she killed's legs, I hesitate to use the word shy concerning her gaming.  But she's certainly still feels a little uncomfortable in the spotlight every so often.                        </div>

                            I always try to recruit female gamers using a simple four-step process.<br/><br/>1. Get really excited about some story from a game . . . without telling them it's a role-playing game.  Usually I'll make analogies to popular culture or classic books that I know they like, so they get a sense of what the story feels like.<br/>2. Drop the, "Yes, you can make up stories like that, too" bomb.<br/>3. Bring them into a rules-light, story-heavy one-shot.<br/>4. . . . PROFIT!<br/><br/>The same process goes for non-gamer men, by the way, but I find that men are less likely to be initially puzzled by the idea that gaming goes beyond D&amp;D.  Introducing people to a rules-light first session is really important, though,  We as experienced gamers - both men and women - sometimes forget just how much skill and hidden expertise go into being able to navigate a session.  First-time players have enough to do just figuring out when they can speak up and what kinds of things they can say.  They don't have to also be worrying about stats, dice, etc.<br/><br/>(My boyfriend decided to introduce a group of newbies to gaming using <i>Ars Magica</i>.  We had words afterwards.  Those words included "what," "were," "you," and "thinking."  And as for the gamers - only two of them came back.)<br/><br/>I'm a woman, and of my female friends, I'd say about 40% are gamers and another 40% have played in one or more games at my invitation.  I wear my sparkly "GAMER" bracelet everywhere and carry a d10 in my purse.  I try not to talk about gaming in the Interminable Gaming Stories way, but rather in a "OMG AND I GET TO MAKE THIS STUFF UP AND ISN'T IT NEAT" way, and that's been really successful in getting most of my non-gamer friends (male and female) to at least understand why I care about this so much.<br/><br/>I'm also an observant Jew, and I find it <i>much</i> easier to get my female friends to try gaming than to introduce it into the religious community.  Judaism doesn't really have the gaming = Satan thing going on, but there's a sense of, "Why would you waste your time on that?"  Being a gamer and being Jewish pretty much places you on the fringe of the community.<br/><br/>As for what I think turns women off?  A lot of little decisions - yes, the artwork, yes, the places where the books are sold, yes, etc. etc. - but I think the biggest factor is that there are very few popular ways to 'get your feet wet'.  I can't really think of any systems that are specifically built to support new players (the gaming equivalent of Dick and Jane), and most GMs have no idea how much expertise they already have, turning new players off.  Male players are more likely to stick through that initial period for social reasons, including that the culture welcomes them more and that they are more likely to have a tight peer group who are already expert players.<br/><br/>Here's the other thing, and this is definitely me blowing smoke out my ass: I think women in our culture are taught not to play.  Certainly most women have less time than men for play (for example, the average woman works one month a year more than the average man, if you include both housework and paid work), but I also have found it hard to get women to admit that they like to play.  We teach women to be caretakers, to be 'selfless' and think of other people - and there are very few things less overtly productive and apparently selfish than play.  It doesn't produce anything, and it doesn't take care of anyone else (unless, of course, you're playing with your kids, and that's an entirely different discussion).  Every woman gamer I know has either had an eccentric upbringing or a seminal encounter with a strong-willed woman.<br/><br/>This is why, as an academic studying play, part of what I try to do is to show why play matters.  We won't get women, and observant Jews, and the elderly, and all the other minimally-represented demographics to take gaming seriously without changing both the culture of role-playing and the culture we live in.<br/><br/>'Cause, you know, everyone needs a grandiose dream.                        </div>

<i>3. For all the people that feel they are minorities, do you try to get any of your non gamer friends/partners/spouses to game? How did you do it? Did you ask? Did you whine? Did you pester?</i><br/><br/>I got a lot of non-gamer friends to play, with very little effort at all.  All of use happened to be into similar things- comic books, HK movies, anime, etc. so there was very little work involved to get folks interested in playing Feng Shui, since it purports to be a game about HK action.<br/><br/>Since then, I've found little trouble in recruiting minority gamers mostly because my groups tend to be mostly or completely people of color.<br/><br/>If anything I have found keeps people from interest, is if they face marginalization in the groups they play with.  Roleplaying suffers more in this regard because often groups are based on weird power dynamics that many people can sense if not articulate that makes them feel uncomfortable.  Even if that issue happens to be the normal sort of thing "the new guy" has to go through, it still tends to push buttons and triggers and be the sort of things people don't want to have to deal with when they're trying to relax and have fun.<br/><br/>For this reason, I often find gamers of color tend to either stick together or not play at all.                        </div>

                            I think people have to very careful about what games they push. I'll share a couple of anecdotes.<br/><br/>A while back I posted on the Forge about a game of <i>Nicotine Girls</i> I ran one night for a friend (<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17166.msg181820#msg181820)" rel="nofollow">[Nicotine Girls]From A to C and back</a>). She's still talking about it several months later: at a party last weekend she was trying to tell her new boyfriend how it had taught her things about herself; she told me she'd thought about it for days afterwards.<br/><br/>This is the woman who gently mocked me about <i>HeroQuest</i>. I don't doubt that the subject matter of NG was what got her to play and what made such an impact on her. Naturally, the simplicity of the game was also a factor.<br/><br/>On the other hand, a few months back one of the group of guys I play with brought along a colleague (secondary teacher). She had gotten interested after a presentation at school had mentioned RPGs and wanted to see for herself. What did she face? A group of blokes playing<i>Pendragon</i>. Her character died (after taking half an hour to create), and she hasn't been back since. That was a major lost opportunity, in my opinion. How different it could have been.<br/><br/>As for my own wife, she has tried playing, and she won't be continuing for very specific reasons. She gets nervous at performing in public, and she doesn't like collaborating on creative projects. She acknowledged that there was value in it, on the other hand, and she was intrigued by my description of <i>Breaking the Ice</i>.<br/><br/>As far as being a minority goes, in Australia I <i>am</i> a minority, and it's never been a problem for me, nor for Dan, a long-time player in my old group. But it's a fact that roleplaying is predominantly a middle-class hobby, and in Australia the middle class is mostly white.                        </div>

                            Jeff, you said:<code>But it's a fact that roleplaying is predominantly a middle-class hobby, and in Australia the middle class is mostly white.</code>This doesn't match up with my experience, for the record. It does match up with the fact that I've mostly played with other middle-class folks, but not with all the people I've known who RPed. When I did adult literacy training I found a lot of lower-class and working class folks who RPed. Same deal with going to public school in Texas. And from what folks like Malcom Sheppard have said, same deal in Ontario outside Toronto. <br/><br/>I really think its more a matter of "the people we play with who play like us and (maybe) the games we play and (certainly) post on these forums" tend to be middle class.                        </div>

                            I've just recruited one of my female co-workers to join the crew for a game of The Mountain Witch. She's never played any kind of RPG before but I think she'll do just fine. I didn't recruit her because she was a she - I just simply saw the potential gamer in her and hoped to encourage it to come out.<br/>
<br/>
We like the same kinds of TV shows and genre fiction and yak about it in the office a lot. Over the years I've developed a kind of sense for people who've "heard about RPGs and wanted to try, but never had the chance." So I told her about RPGs and she was interested and there we go. I will do this with anyone I think might be a good recruit for the gaming table.<br/>
<br/>
My wife on the other hand - No. Interest. At. All. Zip. Zero. Zilch. Nada. Nanimo nai. Oh yes, I've tried, long, long ago. It's not her thing.<br/>
<br/>
S'okay though. We've got plenty of other levels to connect on.                        </div>

                            A few supporting anecdotes:  <br/><br/>My wife has tried a few games - Breaking the Ice, the Shab-al-Hiri Roach, and D&amp;D 3.5.  Of the three, her favorite by far was D&amp;D.  Go figure.  She's expressed no real desire to get involved in "my thing", and compares it to knitting, which is "her thing" and I'm not too interested in.  Interested enough to learn the terms so we can talk about her designs, but not interested enough to pick up the sticks.  She's conversant in RPG jargon, similarly, but finds it sort of boring and, in the case of the Roach, actually hard work.  I see no reason to try to hard sell her - she's tried it in good faith and doesn't really enjoy it.  She's gamed more than I've knitted...<br/><br/>Conversely, I roped two enthusiastic non-gamers into a session of the Roach by just describing my publishing aspirations.  They insisted on trying it, and when I showed up one of them had even outlined his professor in great detail using nothing but my verbal sketch of the set-up.  They did great and will probably play again.                        </div>

                            Oh, and to actually contribute something to the thread (sorry Lisa!): <br/><br/>When I got my mother in law to play Heroquest with us her single biggest worry, which she must have reitterated like a dozen times, was "I won't have to play this for a year, will I?" <br/><br/>I get that block a lot when trying to get non-gamers into game. The concept of the long term campaign that's so standard to many trad games is a level of comitment that lots of normal folks aren't wanting to make just for a game. Having honest one-shot or very short run games is a good thing. <br/><br/>The other thing that helped me get her playing was using Pagan Shore. She's Irish, has spent a lot of time studying Irish history, and was just finishing reading a book about pagan Ireland and the arival of Christianity. So when I suggested playing in that setting, rather than the dancing demon sex settings of Tribe 8 or Exalted or similar freak material, it got her very suddenly interested. So having games that hit tropes that folks are interested in on their own helps as well. <br/><br/>(Both of those reasons make me very happy about many of this years Game Chef games, btw.)                        </div>

                            Wow, a lot of good responses!  <br/><br/>Judd,<br/><br/>I've known people that had the same experience as Janaki.  Heck, I've even been told that before.  I just left that guy's table and when to a different one.  But that's something to deal with too.  Do you think that, that is something from the 'old days' of gaming?  Something you found more common with games like D&amp;D and you won't find as much with a lot of the Indie games?  Or do you think it's just the potential people that we all end up interacting with?<br/><br/>Kleenestar,<br/><br/>Good stuff!  I do think you are on to something with how young women are raised.  I too carry sparkly dice with me whereever I go, but they are in my knitting bag.  And I hadn't thought about the religious aspects of it.  *scratches head*  I have gotten that excuse plenty of times before (i.e. gaming = Satan) but I ignored it (really I did) because I figured, heck I'm pagan.  They know it.  They still hang out with me and I haven't burst into flames (yet) so I pretty much used that to my advantage to prove that I am a decent person, I can live my life and game too.  And then I would ask them "so you wanna play too?"    <br/><br/><br/>Bankuei,<br/><br/><code>For this reason, I often find gamers of color tend to either stick together or not play at all.</code> <br/><br/>Interesting.  I've noticed this myself and couldn't find any real reason/way to understand it myself.  In the group of gamers I commonly play with, I am the 'minority'.  I'm mulatto and female.  But I grew up in very small towns were my family was one of the only minorty families in the entire county.  It was play with -someone- or don't play at all.  Do you think this is the same sort of thing or maybe something else?<br/><br/>Droog,<br/><br/>I agree.  You can't just cant' go flying at someone with Harn binders in your back pack.  They will look at all the literature and go run screaming.  I do think that choosing a good one shot is part of the way to recruit gamers.  Every single one I've helped introduce to gaming, I brought to a game of Dogs.  Has this gal gamed since? <br/><br/>Mike and Brand,<br/><br/>Rock on!  It appears you both have the same things down.  Get people to talk about the things they like and bring the games to them that have the same tropes.  *nodnod*  Have either of the gamers you brought to those games played anything since?  Oh and Mike, it's too bad gaming isn't your wife-lady's thing but like you said, you've got other things to connect on so that's awesome.  <br/><br/>I've just known so many gamers that were married to people that were non-gamers and didn't have -anything- in common and so the time spent away from each other gaming was constantly a huge point of contention.  <br/><br/>Jason,<br/><br/>Can I just say your wife is killer kewl though?  See, she made one hell of an effort to game because she knew it was important to you.  Like you made one hell of an effort to understand knitting because it was important to her.  But how did you really get her to pick up those dice?  I remember you mentioning that you wanted her to play and then I heard she was in a game of the Roach but I never did here the in between stuff.  <br/><br/>Wow this is all good stuff.  So... anyone else have any thougths?  Anecdotes?  <br/><br/>Lisa P                        </div>

                            Lisa, <br/><br/>My mother in law hasn't played again since. Though that's largely because of my FEAR. <br/><br/>Others that I've brought into gaming over the years, however, are mostly still in it. <br/><br/>Though now that I think about it, most of them were of my econimc class and general age. Parents and kids I got into gaming (those more than 15 years apart from me) haven't stayed in with anywhere near the same frequency.                        </div>

Naturally, they insisted we all play it, and I did not discourage them, and she was <em>trapped like a rat!  </em> </div>

                            Telepresence: YES.  Building on people's existing interests is very smart.<br/>
<br/>
Here's one other thing I've tried with excellent success for non-gamers: playing one-on-one games in non-traditional settings.  For example, I'll take someone out to dinner and run a free-form two-hour one-shot in a setting they're already familiar with (a la telepresence's suggestions).  I've made converts top gaming on airplanes, on long car rides, and while waiting in line at the DMV.  The analogy to knitting is really good, I think: people are more willing to experiment if they see it as something they can pick up and put down at will.<br/>
<br/>
Also, calling a game session an "episode" is terminology that has really helped people understand that they can just come and play once, instead of committing to a long-term campaign.  They'd watch just one episode of a TV show; they can try just one session of a game, too.                        </div>

                            kleenestar, you raise a great point.  It can be hard for many non-gamers to wrap their brain around a typical roleplaying situation, but "what if" stuff at parties or over dinner is very relatable<br/>
<br/>
"Which celebrities would you sleep with/which celebrities would you  die before sleeping with?"<br/>
<br/>
"What music/books/people would you take to a desert island." <br/>
<br/>
"Describe in lurid detail what you'd do to your horrible ex-lover/clueless boss/nasty in-laws, if you were guaranteed to get away with it."<br/>
<br/>
Nearly everyone plays such conversational games with their friends or siblings, or did so in high school or college, and the line between them and "role playing" is  trivial.                        </div>

                            So the next question to all of you is this, is it the Indie movement, the ability to 'customize' games so much more, and even the sheer number of games related to pop culture that make it easier than the old days of gaming?  I ask because so many of you have mentioned that you drew friends into gaming by matching their interests/shows they watched/comics they read/etc.<br/>
<br/>
Or do you feel the culture of gaming is changing too?  For example, when I was at GenCon Indy in August 2005, I noticed a huge number of female gamers, young gamers, and old gamers alike, wandering all over the place.  Honestly, it was the CCG's that brought a good portion of them there, but they did wander into the RPG rooms too.  There were plenty there that were there for the online games, but they too wandered into the occassional RPG room.  Most times, I noticed it was because that RPG table they were drawn to was very close to if not directly related to the game they had originally gone to GenCon to play.  (example:  I saw gal who was hooked on some Star Wars online that when she saw other Star Wars related stuff, she checked it out.  I met her in the minis room... checking out a Star Wars mini battle.  When I saw her the next day, she was tearing up some rebels on that minis table.)<br/>

                            Being a female GM has helped bring in a lot of women who wouldn't ordinarily play (both "with men," or regardless) into gaming.  I think there are a lot of easy gateways to gaming, too, from CCGs to computer RPGs to simply, "Boy, wouldn't it be fun to play in X world?"  "Oh, sure, let's!"  <br/><br/>I am happy to go to regular local conventions and find that, yes, indeed, there are young players again.  For a couple of years you didn't see a lot of early teens in the game rooms, but last year I positively decided I was getting too old for this. [snort, grin]  When asking my younger sisters, they said that a big part of it is the availability of those "gateways" but also that it's big in the "counterculture" again.
