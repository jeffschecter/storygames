I've actually run LB quite a few times. I, as a GM, want to try adding a little extra flare to the game. Nothing that actually gets in the way of the players developing the setting, characters, and narrative. <br/>\n<br/>\nI decided something simple would be a big map of the Wild Blue.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) is this ok? (legally)<br/>\n<br/>\n2) My thoughts were to take it to an Office store (max, depot, staples, whatever is closest) and have them put it on a 36x48 sheet. Big enough to look nice on a table, but not so much get in the way. Thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n3) I was also going to make a little gaming token of the Owl. Just a little quarter size token to move on the map. (this was pretty much just a statement....no question here. Move on to #4!)<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Should I add the text descriptions of the planets onto the map?<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Any other ideas for play aids? I just want to add a little jazz to this gaming session. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note: I got a couple sets of q-workshops steampunk dice. I'm going to give them out as prizes for the character who collects the most xp and the character who overcomes the most obstacles. Just a lil bit of fun to help motivate the players to keep hitting keys and complicating things for themselves!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_375290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/375290/#Comment_375290" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-30T16:02:04+00:00" title="April 30, 2012  4:02PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2012 4:02PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, I bet if you asked, John Harper would help you make a kickass giant map.

Hold on to those questions and just let them come up organically in play.

She waiting for the right moment, and then came up with something awesome that make the final scene totally epic.

I really want to jam the entire game into that one session, so I have to keep things moving (yet let things play out organically as they need to). The plans were to just introduce the concepts in the game guide itself and nothing more. I think after running this game several times I've found the perfect balance to keep the game moving. The first time I ran the game, I just let things go. The game did run itself, but too fast and not as fun as I'd hope. The second time, I added too much to the game and stifled the players. The last few times, I found that asking these very, very specific leading questions keeps the game heading in the right direction. Hence, a list that will help me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note: I just got the Clockwork Dolls instrumental sound track. Perfect for a little ambiance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377534/#Comment_377534" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T11:11:32+00:00" title="May 10, 2012 11:11AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the 11x17 Wild Blue map.

Five players. A girl played Cyrus Vance and two boys played Naomi and the lady. We were pursued by two squadrons of Hand of Sorrow's Skyfighters, we were caught by a Sky Squid, we going through a storm in The Lower Depths and finally we arrived to the light side of Nightport with a slowed, busted and leaking Owl. Everything went even better than I expected. Now I want to play Jedi Blackbird. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
