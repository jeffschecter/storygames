The constraint was to write an RPG in 200 words (no more, no less) and see what I could get across. I'd love to hear any reactions people have to it.<br/><br/><a href="http://catachresis.shoelesspetegames.com/a-200-word-rpg/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://catachresis.shoelesspetegames.com/a-200-word-rpg/</a><br/><br/>thanks,<br/>Peter                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432902/#Comment_432902" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-21T16:57:24+00:00" title="May 21, 2014  4:57PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Peter,<br/><br/>It looks like pretty much everything is there, so long as the reader is willing to read between the lines.<br/><br/>My first reaction is, funny enough: those are some really poor odds! Is that intentional? With the mechanic you have outlined, someone who can apply ALL THREE traits still barely has a 50% chance of rolling a 6.<br/><br/>My second reaction is: how would we handle conflict between characters? Not a huge problem, but may be worth addressing if you have any words left.<br/><br/>My third reaction is: how is Situation established here? Not entirely obvious; a quick starter or a random table could be a good word-efficient way to do that!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlbeyAmakiir" title="AlbeyAmakiir"><img alt="AlbeyAmakiir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/139/nCE1BSIBJZEBM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlbeyAmakiir">AlbeyAmakiir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432903/#Comment_432903" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-21T17:39:43+00:00" title="May 21, 2014  5:39PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2014 5:39PM by AlbeyAmakiir.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's Nd6, where N is the number of applicable traits plus the initial die.<br/><br/>Which is still pretty difficult.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432904/#Comment_432904" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-21T18:30:43+00:00" title="May 21, 2014  6:30PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, that's right. 4d6, trying to roll a 6, is roughly 50% odds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PASchaefer" title="PASchaefer"><img alt="PASchaefer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PASchaefer">PASchaefer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432907/#Comment_432907" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-21T19:23:52+00:00" title="May 21, 2014  7:23PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul: I assure you, I used every one of my allotted words! <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/>  It's been some time since I wrote that, but I remember having to drop some things that I wanted to include to fit my 200-word limit.<br/><br/>That does seem pretty steep, now that you all mention it. It is something that only comes up when the player disagrees with <i>everyone else</i> about something involving her character. I suspect my motivation at the time was ensuring that one player overruling everyone else was pretty rare.<br/><br/>I recall an earlier version where it was a contested roll, the person who disagreed rolling against the current narrator. In that instance, the traits coming into play had a much larger effect. I think that came out of the draft when I shifted away from one person telling the story at a time to everyone adding in story until someone disagreed. At that point, a contested roll no longer made sense.<br/><br/>As is, changing the condition for success to rolling a five or six changes the probability to a range from 1/3 to ~80% with all three traits. That's a bit more mid-line, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
