Essentially, for doing cool stuff.  In play, I've found it really hard to do this.  It always feels really awkward and uncomfortable for me.  Now, I don't want to talk about whether Sorcerer is a good game or not, and whether the mechanic is a good one, because clearly, for many people, the mechanic works just fine.  What I want to talk about is why this mechanic bugs me, and whether mechanics that resemble it in some games are really doing the same thing, and whether I'm likely to enjoy them.<br/><br/>So what is it about the bonus dice in Sorcerer?  I've talked to Ron about them, and he gave me a very cogent reason for why the rule is the way it is, so <i>intellectually</i> I get what they're supposed to be doing.  But in play, I find it really freaking hard to use them.  I always feel really weird saying "I liked that, here, have a die".   At first I thought this was just a holdover from other games where it's weird to get an in-game bonus of out-of-game reasons, but I don't think that's entirely it.  I guess part of it's because I feel really uncomfortable judging another player's contribution to the game.  I don't like being in a position where my opinion of their action determines whether it succeeds or fails.  <br/><br/>To some extent, a traditional GM is in that position anyway.  If you decide that their action is foolish "in game", then you'll give it a low chance to succeed.  Often I found running Savage Worlds that if I didn't like the way the action was going, I could make them roll often enough that they'd fail eventually, and conversely give actions I liked enough second attempts that they'd eventually succeed.  So in some ways Sorcerer is just making that process overt.  Rather than shaping the story covertly with your GM powers, you do it overtly, by saying "I liked that".  I think that's a good thing.  I'm all for being above board about how the GM is using their authority.  But in play, I still don't like it, and I don't think it's just because I'd rather preserve the illusion that I'm not shaping the outcome of the game.  What it comes down to, I think, is that I think that good narration, interesting ideas, cool lines, are rewarding enough on their own.  They <i>are</i> the reward, or rather, if fun play results from an action, that's rewarding enough.  Tacking a bonus dice onto it seems kinda redundant to me, or at least it feels that way in play.  As a Sorcerer GM, I felt weird that my enjoyment had more mechanical weight than anyone elses.<br/><br/>But! It's not just the imbalance of power, or assigning bonus dice as a GM that bugs me.  I'd like to talk about MLWM as well.  I don't remember the name of the mechanic, but there's a rule that actions that show desperation, sincerity, or intimacy, get a bonus d4, d6, or d8 (depending on which of the three are involved).  I think I understand what the rule's trying to do.  It's trying to focus play on those three things, so that players are likely to drive towards desperation, sincerity, and intimacy in play.  It's also meant to highlight when those things are happening in play, giving the players a mechanical way to acknowledge that the events are meaningful to the character in one of those ways.  There was one instance from when I played in which the mechanic did that really well.  My character was making an overture to his loved one, but, being unable to speak of anything except medical matters, he was writing a letter, making his feelings known.  I read the letter aloud as I wrote it, and I think I really hit on the main conflict of the character, whether he was able to see himself as a good person (and I think this is maybe the conflict for all MLWM characters).   When Malcolm gave me the extra d8 for sincerity, it felt like a vindication of that, like we were acknowledging the power of this turning point for the character.  <br/><br/>But there was also a point where the mechanic didn't feel right at all.  It was late in the game, and we were all a bit tired.  I think we were all angling toward endgame, trying to get there as quick as possible.  I was making a roll to resist the master's latest order, and I knew that if I succeeded, I'd trigger endgame.  I needed a bonus die, so I played up the character's desperation.  This felt really weird to me.  I didn't like the feeling of performing for a reward, of doing something that I wouldn't have done otherwise, just to get the die.  And I think that's the key for me.  I don't like to feel like I'm performing when I roleplay.  I enjoy entertaining my friends, and I've GMed games where I'm essentially just being an entertainer, but "performing" feels different.  It's that thing where you're playing up the description of what your character is doing, or going for drama over practicality, when you're not really feeling it.  I find it exhausting to pretend to be invested in something I'm not, and I think sometimes these kinds of mechanics can encourage that.  I don't like to feel like I'm investing in the drama of a situation just for a mechanical reward, and I don't like to make players jump through those hoops when I'm the GM, either.  <br/><br/>There are a number of other games that have similar mechanics, but I'm less familiar with them.  I'd really like to hear from people who know more about them.  For example:<br/><br/>Exalted:  I've played a little Exalted, but I think we were doing it wrong.  Shreyas made the point to me that Stunting doesn't involve any kind of judgement from the GM, because there are clear guidelines to follow about awarding Stunt Dice.  I think that's a good point, but they still feel like they'd feel wrong to me, at times.  Exalted players, have there ever been times when you've amped up your description just because you needed the stunt dice?  How did that feel?  GMs, do you feel like you're excercising judgement when you're awarding stunt dice?  Are there ever times when you have a difference of opinion with a player over whether a die should be awarded?  <br/><br/>PTA:  Fanmail.  Is this the same thing?  I can see how in play, it can become just a way to say thanks for a great piece of narration, an exciting moment, and so on.  Are there ever times when you feel like you're performing for a reward?  Are you ever just doing it for the fanmail?  <br/><br/>TSoY: Gift Dice don't trigger the thing for me.  I think it's because they're limited in number, and can be awarded however you like, so they can be just as much a tactical decision as a performative one.  That said, I can see how, depending on how you play, "begging for gift dice" could become a hassle.  Has this happened to anyone?<br/><br/>I think what I'm coming down to is that sometimes these mechanics, which are supposed to encourage "gifts", feel more like "payment". So performance, or roleplaying, which is supposed to feel like entertainment, starts to feel like <i>work</i>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105248/#Comment_105248" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-28T20:46:40+00:00" title="October 28, 2007  8:46PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>As a Sorcerer GM, I felt weird that my enjoyment had more mechanical weight than anyone elses.</blockquote> I understand how you feel.

You earn Artha when you play up, go against, or change your Beliefs (flags). Beliefs aren't there to limit how you play your character (which is why you are awarded for playing/breaking/changing them). They are there for you to tell everyone what content you want in the game. Artha bribes you to keep this information up to date and in line with what you really want. I've often seen static flags cause problems when what you thought you wanted and what you want now misaligns. The feedback cycle in Burning Wheel keeps that from happening. <br/><br/>I'm not against systems where you judge each other's creative input. I prefer when it doesn't shut down player participation and it's done by everyone at the table (depending on the specific game). We have plenty of games that judge your tactical ability. If you extend the idea past RPGs, we have plenty of exciting board games that judge your coordination, drawing skills, knowledge, and more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic" title="Hexabolic"><img alt="Hexabolic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/687/nBYV76DDKYIZ2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hexabolic">Hexabolic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105344/#Comment_105344" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T08:47:21+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  8:47AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And of course, I'm playing Wushu, which explicitly rewards--and requires--narrative embellishment.  We're also using a Stunt mechanic and FATE Aspects.  I don't have a problem with GM judgment being used at the table to confer metagame advantages based on player narration.  The thrust is to avoid characterizing actions as the vanilla "I swing," as well as to drive play thematically.  In practice, my group has had no difficulty with player creative input, though that may be our group in particular.  We're all writers who bring a strong communal brainstorming vibe to our play.  We frequently invoke Aspects for extra dice or rerolls, and we're pretty loose with the narrative application of the Aspect to the situation in play.  Basically, if the player thinks it works, it works.  I don't put myself in the position of saying "no," though other players have occasionally offered feedback or suggestions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105422/#Comment_105422" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T15:46:04+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  3:46PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I guess I am saying I don't like mechanics like this.

For example the dice in MLWM worked very well for me almost for the entire game.<br/><br/>I think Artha in Burning Wheel and XP in TSoY are totally different animals, since they have specific criteria which grant them, and this is never based on how well you perform your character.<br/><br/>I've not played PTA, so I don't really know, but I think that Fanmail would be one of these mechanics I don't like.  The fact that there's pretty much no cost associated with it, and no strict criteria for it, means essentially it's a reward for doing things people like.  It's cool that it's democritised rather than driven by a GM, but I'm not sure that's my problem.  My problem is feeling like I have to perform my character more than I otherwise would, in order to have a mechanical effect on the game.<br/><br/>Which makes it sound like I like to play boring.  I don't!  I love acting things out in character, and hitting the dramatically awesome parts of play, and getting to the meat of a conflict.  I just don't love feeling like I have to do that for a mechanical reward.  Like, the reward kinda cheapens the whole thing for me, especially if I'm not sure if I was doing it for the fun, or for the reward.  It's like if you got paid for making awesome posts on Story Games.  It would be cool to get some reward for some of the awesome posts you've made, but as soon as you start thinking about it the other way around "I need some cash, what can I write about?" it's a totally different thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105428/#Comment_105428" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T16:09:13+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  4:09PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, <br/><br/>I like the democratized versions* of this for a simple reason -- which is the reason that Joshua doesn't like it -- because what gets rewarded is subjective to the group you are playing with. What gets rewarded in your group is what your group wants, and playing towards (if not directly to) that reward is a method (not the only, maybe not the best, but a method) to communicate that in an emergent way as you play together. (The only time I dislike them for the reasons Joshua states are when the game mandates what quality is.) <br/><br/>So when I get a fan mail point I think of it less as "I just got paid for my performance" and more as a "Sarah just told me she likes it when I do that, cool, maybe I'll do that some more." Yes, its kinda a blunt instrument, behaviourist and crass -- but sometimes in the heat of the moment and around things we don't always give our full attention to, that's an effective way to go about it. <br/><br/>The times I find that I don't like a system like this are the rare times when I'm playing with a group with which I'm already so closely attuned that the giving of the bennie becomes pointless. Like in solo games with Mo I don't use any such system, because, well... we already know what we're doing, and why, and already feed back into each other directly and heavily. So having the coarser system doesn't feel right. I've even got a couple three person groups where this is true, but once I hit 4 players, I find that something that creates a subjective and emergent feedback cycle is desirable. That can be purely social, for some groups. (Maybe that's one of the reasons you don't like it? You want your cycle to be more social and less mechanical, and/or your group is already doing it in more subtle ways?) Other groups need the direction. <br/><br/><br/><br/>* Though I have to say that Graham's point about the rewarded performance is one I hadn't considered, and that gives me a new slant on my ambivalent relationship with things like Exalted's stunting system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105430/#Comment_105430" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T16:26:01+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  4:26PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started off really liking mechanics like this, but over time my fondness for them has cooled to a kind of benevolent indifference.  If a system has it, that's nice, but if it doesn't, that's nice too.<br/><br/>I'm less sanguine about systems where it seems that bonus dice are <i>required</i> in order for the characters to have a chance of succeeding at tasks.  At that point, they stop being bonuses/rewards and become just another resource that has to be managed...only it's a resource that is replenished through an insanely vague mechanism.  (What we think is cool <i>right now</i> doesn't have to have a single thing in common with what we thought was cool in the last session, or what we think will be cool tomorrow.)  Games like that are rare, but they're out there, and it's that kind of edge case that worries me.<br/><br/><br/>So basically, I'm at the point where I prefer bonus mechanics that are largely irrelevant to the actual core mechanics of the game.  If they're a marginal thing, strictly a "hey, I liked that, have a cookie" deal, then I'm happy...sometimes someone will get an unasked-for cookie, and that's awesome and fun and a positive experience for everyone.  The closer to the center of the play experience the bonus system becomes, the less fun it gets for me.  If I'm involved in passing out the bonuses, I want to be doing it because it's fun and because I genuinely want to reward someone, not because I am <i>required</i> to pass out bonuses.  And if I'm one of the people receiving the bonuses, then I want 'em to be a real reward for something I did...I don't want to feel like I have to do certain things because I need to earn a bonus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105435/#Comment_105435" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T16:48:28+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  4:48PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>My problem is feeling like I have to perform my character more than I otherwise would, in order to have a mechanical effect on the game.</blockquote>\nThe thing with fanmail, is that it reinforces character tropes.  So, if someone gives you fanmail it's usually because you were performing your character exacty how you wanted, you know, from the concept and all that.  I could see it reinforcing things like a catch phrase or something, but that's probably an intentional side effect, too.  Like, when Mulder says "spontaneous combustion" or another crazy theory and Scully thinks he's joking.  They do that a lot, but that's also a part of who they are, and its fun.  Fanmail tries to re-enforce that.  I'm not saying it won't, or can't, hit you the wrong way, but the intent is to reinforce playing your character in ways that tie into how you've already established your character, as well as simply making it more fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105455/#Comment_105455" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-29T20:24:44+00:00" title="October 29, 2007  8:24PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thing about fan mail, it's that is very valuable, finite, and if you don't give it to someone, it's wasted and the group lose it forever. So, after a while the players understand that it's in their interest to give fan mail to others.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it's not like you think about some reason to give fan mail, and if nobody give you that reason, you don't give any fa mail. You have already decided to give fan mail, you need only to find some sort of justification during the game, and you have to decide who will get it (but this last point is self-corrective, I have see that people tend to give fan mail to people who have less).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, at the end, it's no bonus. The game is built on the hypothesis that you WILL get it, in that finite amount. But the fact that you have to justify it push you to verbalize what you like most in your fellow players' play.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt push you to talk about what you like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105485/#Comment_105485" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-30T02:35:38+00:00" title="October 30, 2007  2:35AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            one more data point: the only game I've played that had these rules was Exalted, and they immediately rubbed me the wrong way                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhosmer1" title="jhosmer1"><img alt="jhosmer1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4446384493_29cc47b601_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhosmer1">jhosmer1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105519/#Comment_105519" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-30T08:51:55+00:00" title="October 30, 2007  8:51AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't played Sorcerer or PTA, but I have tried to implement bonus dice in my D&amp;D 3.5 game as a means of promoting roleplaying.<br><br>In my first attempt, I gave each player one 6-sided die per player at the table, and told them that they could roll the dice and add it to another player's roll at any time, as long as they came up with some sort of in-game rationale for the aid.

I find that often, having players choose broadly and subjectively who to give a bonus to gives the game a dynamic more like a "popularity contest".  Now, I don't think there is anything objectively wrong with a popularity contest, but it's generally not what I look for in a game.  I have issues with some boardgames that allow free spending to aid or block other players, like Illuminati.  Diplomacy among friends is often similar.  <br/><br/>In role-playing, early on I encountered a common house rule in convention games from the early 80s where a reward was given to the best player as determined by vote.  We adopted a similar bonus, voting for best roleplayer each session in a variant Champions game (using Storypath cards) in '91 or so.  I haven't done Sorcerer, but I've done plenty of other more recent games like PtA.  <br/><br/>In principle, a popularity contest means that everyone is trying to please their peers, which seems like it could be a good thing.  However, I find that I'm usually put off by the dynamic.  <br/><br/>I think it may also have to do with the idea of objectively rating creative contributions.  i.e. I wouldn't think much of a writing circle where people gave point ratings to other people's stories.  I think giving an opinion is fine, including how much one liked it, but I feel like it detracts to make that more numeric.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
