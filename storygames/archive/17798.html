A serious and tough, but civilized and optimistic hardholder. He collects books about governance and laws, reads John Locke, and has taught himself how to play chess, but also isn't afraid to shoot someone in the head if they try to do something he considers a problem in his society.<br/><br/>He looks with great interest at the "erase an option from your holding" improvement. He wants to improve the life of his people. His plan is to organize an outing to explore nearby lands and find other holds to trade with. Sure enough, he chose for his gang to be "well-disciplined".<br/><br/>Enough said, right? You get it. He wants power so he can make everything better for everyone, build an efficient society under his rule.<br/><br/>Of course, I throw some bad news at him: he can't have everything under control, there's bad stuff going on. Of course, this frustrates him as a character (who wants to have everything under control). But it also frustrates him a bit as a player: looking at how the dice and the system works, he asks me, "How can this ever get better? It seems like we'll just be spinning our wheels round and round." <br/><br/>He learns in this session that there are rumours going around the holding that "he will be replaced soon by a new hardholder". He wants to know if this is "kosher", asking me if, as MC, I'm allowed to put something like that into play even though he didn't roll a miss on his Wealth roll. "Is my rule contested now? It sounds like it's going to be. Can you do that without me missing this roll?"<br/><br/>I can tell he wants to settle things "at home" so he can set out to conquer new lands, explore new territory, and trade with other holdings.<br/><br/>[A partially-related question: how do you use the Wealth move when the hardholder is traveling outside the holding? Roll it each session, anyway? Never roll it? Roll it in secret, and tell the hardholder the outcome when he comes home? Roll it each time the hardholder comes back home?]<br/><br/>Now, just to make it clear:<br/><br/>This is not an "asking for help in desperation" kind of post. I'm having fun, the hardholder is having fun. If we stop having fun, that's something to deal with at the social level.<br/><br/>But I'd love to hear if you have any clever thoughts on how I might handle this hardholder (and this player) as the MC of the game. I don't particularly feel that I can stick to the principles (especially "make apocalypse world seem real", and the fronts I have written up, never mind the Wealth move) and, at the same time, ignore or sweep the problems in the hardhold under the rug. But I also want to be a fan of the player character, and give him a chance to spread his wings and do some exploring, if that's what he was hoping for with this game.<br/><br/>Suggest tips, tricks, moves, and/or fronts! I look forward to your thoughts.<br/><br/>How would you handle this, for maximum fun? How would you take advantage of this dynamic?<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semiomant" title="semiomant"><img alt="semiomant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semiomant">semiomant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402651/#Comment_402651" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-04T02:20:01+00:00" title="January  4, 2013  2:20AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see two routes here: confront him with people who have very different political visions, and confronting him with people who over-affirm his vision.<br/><br/>I mean Locke and books on governance, that is an awfully naive way to do do it. It is likely that the books on governance are conflicting, many books published come from different academic schools. What one books thinks is best others find full of faults. So a lot of scenes can be done just delineating what kind of political dogma one thinks is supposed to bring "everlasting peace and happiness for everyone". Whatever one can come up with is bound to shortchange somebody or destroy someones own dreams of leadership/perfect society.<br/><br/>The other end is another successful hardholder, bound on the same quest of your player. Maybe the other hardholder is slightly more successful? Suggests a peaceful submission to his order to your player? Will he follow the dream of making everything better for "his" people by submitting (after all there IS an economy of scale, there will be more trade, a larger peacekeeping army etc. pp.)? What if the other guy has some unacceptable tenet in his political dogma (maybe socialism if your player is so much in into the mercantile ideology of locke, or racism, sexism or ... there are tons of of -isms to pave the road to hell with) ?  Will your hardholder still join for economic benefit or start a holy war over it? What if a prophet appears and preaches that this kinds of fights started the apocalypse ?<br/><br/>Why not even let the hardholder succeed? And then show how much "fun" rulership really is? You know the kind of "fun" Dr.Doom had after really conquering the world and finding out administration is utterly boring?<br/><br/>And what about the other players? How do they stand to this "ordering the world" thing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402664/#Comment_402664" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-04T08:08:37+00:00" title="January  4, 2013  8:08AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 4, 2013 8:10AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apocalypse World posits an eternally unstable system. If the player's goal is stability that is not going to happen until he retires his character to safety. <br/><br/>I like Semiomant's ideas! The first idea - have his followers get really excited about following his orders and ultimate vision 200%. If he wants peace they will give him PEACE, which will be horrifying.<br/><br/>The second option is, to me, even more interesting, because the player is given lots of really great choices. I'd make the larger, rival hardhold positively dreamy except for that one thing that is a little repulsive. Not over the top repulsive, just ... in conflict with your player's vision for a reasonable and just society. Joining this group has to be an unambiguous improvement for the people the player says his character cares about. <br/><br/>In my most recent run I had a hardhold that was amazing in every way but one - the leader insisted on a population of exactly 100. Anyone in excess of that was killed. Those hundred had it really good, and the PCs certainly could have been among them, but for them to take a place meant somebody less useful, less smart, less productive had to die.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MarkT" title="MarkT"><img alt="MarkT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/983/nP0EE6Z6XSTVP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MarkT">MarkT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402666/#Comment_402666" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-04T08:09:46+00:00" title="January  4, 2013  8:09AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've found it useful to give my hardholders things that look controllable, but are really otherworldly symptoms of the apocalypse.

Some people say it came from the stars; others say it was one of the machines that created the apocalypse, riding the winds of the Maelstrom. But when you get close to it, when you're brave enough to put your gun in your belt and crawl out in the badlands far enough to get a good look at it, your teeth vibrate in your skull. It's powerful, everyone knows that.

However, they also keep slaves and have a gladiatorial pit: they don't have a great deal of respect for anyone outside their society. <br/><br/>So this will tie well into the hardholder's thoughts and ideas. (His eyebrows climb his face every time he learns a little more about the neighbours, though it's just hints so far.)<br/><br/>I love this line of thought (and your examples!), and will definitely head in that direction.<br/><br/>The next question, then, becomes: how hard to push on the badness in the hardhold itself? AW makes it pretty clear that things are never going to be peachy-keen. There's the Wealth move, the nasty hardhold options you choose at the start of play, Fronts which threaten the hardhold and its inhabitants, plus all the various moves and principles (like "look where they're not in control and push there", and "make everyone a threat").<br/><br/>I'm not sure how finding that balance is actually going to look in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402679/#Comment_402679" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-04T09:51:20+00:00" title="January  4, 2013  9:51AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I already introduced a woman who's a wealthy slave merchant, visiting the hardhold.

His policies have winners and losers, right, like all policies everywhere must; give the named inhabitants of the hardhold opinions about whether his policies are right or wrong, and make them willing to tell the hardholder all about their opinions in straightforward non-violent ways. "I think this is unjust. Please do this instead." "My friends are having trouble getting scratch. Please let us raid our neighbors." "My family is sick. Please get us medicine." "Dust promises us a beautiful land of flowing water and delicious food. Let us leave with her." "I should be lieutenant instead of Camo. Let me replace him for you."<br/><br/>Especially: have NPCs complain about the hardholder's policies to the other PCs too. "I should be lieutenant instead of Camo. Rex, help me convince the hardholder to replace Camo with me."<br/><br/>You can escalate to violence later, in the cases where it's inevitable, when the hardholder will totally understand what went wrong and why.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_402681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402681/#Comment_402681" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-04T10:10:49+00:00" title="January  4, 2013 10:10AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A chess game in AW would be so hot.

Workers unions are really hard to deal with, especially if the work they do requires skill. Consider the small populations of the hardholds and invest some skilled craftsmen they can compete about in a more or less friendly manner. Like, even if they are your 100% reliable allies they might offer some ridiculous privilege to lure your only doctor to their hold. No more emergency aid!

In any case, he'll have to divide his attention and lean heavily on his lieutenants, which sets up all kinds of opportunities for hard moves and PC-NPC-PC triangles.  <br/><br/>Also remember that it's the Apocalypse World, so the warlord who reads Locke and Machiavelli and tries to be enlightened is no better, ultimately, than the warlord who wears a clown suit and takes his cues from the holy Magic 8-ball.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402971/#Comment_402971" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-07T20:25:38+00:00" title="January  7, 2013  8:25PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2013 8:26PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, there's been a lot of great advice about fun stuff to do with this guy.

Vincent says this too, in his MC advice -- don't take the cool things away from the character.  One way to avoid doing this is to make NPC's pretty straightforward, even if they're weird.  If he's got a lieutenant who's loyal but dumb and another who's smart but self-interested, play them like that.  <br/><br/>Likewise, if he reaches out to a suspicious neighbor, don't have every neighbor be hostile or lay traps, or he'll stop doing that.  More interesting to present mixed advantages and atrocities, as in <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>.  Those cannibal cultists genuinely want to be his friends and can help him fight his enemies and rebuild the water plant... but they just can't trust him unless he has dinner with them and asks for seconds.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
