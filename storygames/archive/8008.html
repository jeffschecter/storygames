And then I realized that this is the same community that had some great info for making D&amp;D 4ed dungeon tiles, so I wanted to see what you all thought.<br/><br/>Any suggestions on an easy and cheap way for me to get some better tiles for game prototyping? Size-wise I am looking for something bigger than 1x1. Max of 2x2. Think about the size of Carcassonne tiles or slightly smaller.<br/><br/>I went to a mosaic supply store today and bought some glass tiles about 1x1, but they have this crappy glue stuff attached to them that won't come off, and I want something other than glass anyway.<br/><br/>Eventually I will print something out to stick to the tiles. But for now, I am happy writing on them with a Sharpie. I don't have a lot of tools and would love to just go somewhere this weekend and get what I need so I can get to the game design part.<br/><br/>Ideas? Wood?

I'd do this in wood, but then I have access to a bench saw and cheap materials which would make that five minutes work and cost effective.  I think heavy cardboard, or some kind of foamcore might be a better option.  Make sure you've got a good cutting tool.  If you're making lots, you'll want some kind of guillotine, or a bench cutter, or something like that.  Don't try to make more than a dozen or so with a craft knife or scissors, you'll just get frustrated.<br/><br/>How many tiles do you need? For prototyping, it might be cool to use something that can take a dry-erase marker, so you can reuse the same tiles.  If that comes off too easily, you can use a sharpie, and then wash it off with a solvent.  That'll stop you having to make hundreds of tiles for every new idea.  I find if there's a huge amount of work involved in changing your ideas, you tend to get stuck in your ways.  Strip styrene would be an expensive but effective way to do that.  Otherwise you could try "Duraseal" or whatever they call it now, that sticky plastic sheeting stuff, and put that over cardboard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176939/#Comment_176939" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-31T18:57:22+00:00" title="October 31, 2008  6:57PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed about using a dry erase marker, at least for these early versions.<br/><br/>I just need 25-40 tiles for right now.
