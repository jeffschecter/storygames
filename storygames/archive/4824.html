Initially I wanted to use Sorcerer, but all of my Sorcerer play has been "indie long form" (i.e., 5-6 sessions) and I'm not sure how I'd have to twist it for shorter play.  On the other hand, Dogs in the Vineyard and Mountain Witch seem to run pretty well as one-session games.  Burning Wheel, maybe not so much.  People have been talking about how you can play out a whole adventure of "Red Box D&amp;D;" in 3 hours or less, including character creation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's the deal here?  Why do some games work better in such a tight timeframe than others?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso: Judd, if you're reading this - I know you've run a bunch of "Dictionary of Mu" games at conventions - is there any trick to running a satisfying Sorcerer game in 4 hours or less?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108301/#Comment_108301" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T15:14:57+00:00" title="November 14, 2007  3:14PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 14, 2007 3:15PM by droog.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's about front-loaded situation.

The players have to conceive their chrs, write Kickers etc; then the GM has to go away and think about it. 'In Utero' presents a situation that's already in motion with the Kickers going off. The risk is that people might not identify with the chrs and the situation because they didn't write them. Hopefully, if you know the players well you can present something that will grab them.<br><br>So <i>Mountain Witch</i> is obvious, because it also presents a situation already in motion. Same with DitV or basic D&amp;D. You know what you're doing and you hit the ground running.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108331/#Comment_108331" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-14T18:09:18+00:00" title="November 14, 2007  6:09PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It also has to do with how complex the system is - how much can be explained during play and how much needs to be explained beforehand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Shadow of Yesterday is many times easy than Burning Wheel to play quickly, even though I don't think it's that much more focused.
