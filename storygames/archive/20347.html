Because they were an outgrowth of player-vs-player wargames, the referee typically is just there to adjudicate the free-kriegspiel style interactions between the players.<br/><br/>In Callisto, which is an epistolary Braunstein with distributed narrative authority, the ref doesn't even have typical GM-authority over the world and is mostly limited to reporting on what the players have declared. I'm not sure if that's more asymmetrical or less than a free-kriegspiel ref.<br/><br/>There are quite a few games like STALKER, where the PCs have detailed stats and inventory and the troubles they encounter in the Zones just have descriptions and a single toughness number. This makes the game about the PCs and their actions, and focuses on the fiction of the enemies rather than their stats.<br/><br/>Mouse Guard and Torchbearer are a bit similar to Dungeon World, with enemies mostly defined by their Nature rather than detailed skills.<br/><br/>In Golden Sky Stories, the GM is explicitly a storyteller and most NPCs are defined mechanically by their description and 4 main stats. The NPCs are mechanically symmetrical with the PCs, except that most NPCs are likely to be human or kami rather than henge, and thus on totally different ability scales.<br/><br/>Ryuutama, on the other hand, has the GM leveling up alongside the PCs.<br/><br/>At the far other end of the spectrum, Fate games like Diaspora have the GM make up a PC and suggest that the group consensus is the most important thing, reducing the distance between player-roles and GM-roles. And in Fiasco, everyone is on an equal footing.<br/><br/>I'll let the OD&amp;D experts talk about the early D&amp;D experience.<br/><br/>As to what specifically lead Vincent to use it, I couldn't say. (Has he said, somewhere? Seems like the kind of thing that might come up in discussion.)

There you have a strong GM-figure who presents a complete and "real" world to the players, where they may do anything they like. Sometimes this concept goes so far as to let the players play *themselves* in the resulting game.<br/><br/>In reality, the GM has rulebooks and stats and so forth, including stats for the player characters. The players, however, are given the illusion that everything is real, and no dice or rules are involved.<br/><br/>While the GM might have stats for opponents and the characters themselves, the players only have access to the fictional descriptions of the GM, as well as likely a plain English write-up of their character (no numbers or stats here).<br/><br/>The GM interacts with the nuts and bolts of the game and rolls dice. The players, however, only experience the "fictional" reality of the game, being completely "hidden" from the rules engine running underneath.<br/><br/>This is, in a way, the opposite of a game like AW. <br/><br/>I don't know of any published examples, but it's certainly a thing that a lot of people who tried to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448373/#Comment_448373" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-05T04:08:22+00:00" title="September  5, 2015  4:08AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for such things arise, I've always figured it was a natural evolution born from practicality.<br/><br/>Everyone can see that GM and player roles are not symmetrical in an RPG - that's hardly a controversial point. Pretty much every RPG (until recent times, anyway) presents different rules for the GM and the players - in D&amp;D's case, it's actually different books!<br/><br/>Whoever was designing this stuff must have noticed pretty quickly that, from a perspective of practicality, the players and GM have different needs and different levels of attention. For the GM to have two-page write-ups on each NPC or monster is simply too much to handle. For players, however, it works just fine, since that's all they have to worry about.<br/><br/>So I'd imagine that assymetry is, first of all, "native" to the medium to begin with, and, second, the desire to have different rules for GM and players is very simply a practical matter (as the GM is controlling multiple characters as well as tending to other duties).<br/><br/>I can't really see RPGs evolving any other way, given where they started.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448375/#Comment_448375" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-05T05:20:43+00:00" title="September  5, 2015  5:20AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In early D&amp;D, the referee's characters, even adventurer NPCs who supposedly occupied the same in-fiction niche as PCs, did not follow the same rules as PCs to any degree; the stats weren't randomly generated, their items broke the rules for magic items, they had powers and spells not accessible to PCs, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448386/#Comment_448386" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-05T21:11:23+00:00" title="September  5, 2015  9:11PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2015 9:13PM by lumpley.">edited September 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was in a mailing list discussion group about Ars Magica back in the mid and late 90s, where the consensus was that the game's rules should work equally for PCs and NPCs. Statting up your NPCs meant going through regular character creation, then cycling them through the experience system until they were as old as you wanted them to be. When you wanted an NPC to travel from one covenant to another, you should make skill rolls for them to find out whether they made it and how long it took.<br/><br/>I thought this was poorly considered then, and I still do.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448388/#Comment_448388" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-05T22:32:34+00:00" title="September  5, 2015 10:32PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The asymmetry property here is intimately tied with the question of whether the game features character-vs-character resolution more or less prominently than pass/fail resolution. This was a big discussion topic at the Forge at one point, with e.g. Heroquest and Sorcerer as showcase examples of games that choose to structure all resolution on a vs model, as opposed to e.g. Call of Cthulhu or D&amp;D, where pass/fail is the primary resolution mechanic, and opposed contests are resolved with further rules to compare the individual passes and fails.<br/><br/>Obviously enough the question of whether the GM rolls dice ties into this issue of mechanical perspective, as often enough it is the GM who would provide the mechanical opposition in an opposed force resolution system. Even My Life with Master, a game with very abstract opposed conflicts, if any at all (you can play through the entire game without any character-vs-character conflicts occurring), has the GM constantly rolling against the PC to provide the variable resistance the pool-based dice mechanics require.<br/><br/>Historically dice pools are associated with opposed force resolution, because they make it so simple to measure opposing forces in the abstract, and bid them against each other. Similarly, simple pass/fail resolution has usually associated with task resolution systems where you'd resolve individual tasks and then compose a general outcome out of the accumulating fictional positioning. If I had to name where the notion of using character-centered dicing without active counter-force came into conflict-resolving games in a big way, I'd have to go with the aforementioned MLwM; it has a nominal counter-force as a feature of the mechanics, but it's not active in any way - you could get the same practical results with a single dice roll performed by the player alone. From MLwM to games like Polaris and Under the Bed, and thence to Apocalypse World as a sort of a halfway house between these "one roll resolves the whole scene" games and traditional task resolution systems.<br/><br/>The other way to look at it would be to say that Call of Cthulhu was the first game where "only players roll" was prominent. It is true that the game includes procedures for GM-controlled NPCs to do the same things <i>in theory</i>, but in practice it's all set up exactly like something like AW in this regard: NPCs are there to provide information and pressure that force PCs to make skill checks; you wouldn't really miss it if the game just outright told you to have NPCs succeed in everything they do, except if the GM wants otherwise, or a PC acts to foil them. It'd be mostly combat that would run a little bit differently. Probably an improvement over all those NPC stat blocks for most purposes, frankly.<br/><br/>Or, if one blanches at the idea of CoC as a game where the GM doesn't roll, then the next candidate historically speaking would probably be Paranoia - with that game it's completely explicit that the GM does not roll dice, only the players do. It's all player-facing mechanics, all the time, and NPCs explicitly do not follow the same rules. A major step away from even CoC's kinda-sorta departure from stringent rules symmetry.<br/><br/>In summation, we can point at various origins for this idea. As is often the case with cultural history, there is necessarily no single point of origin for something like this - it has probably been invented again and again as the need arose, more or less unconscious of the prior art.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448408/#Comment_448408" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-07T23:50:00+00:00" title="September  7, 2015 11:50PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In early D&amp;D, the referee's characters, even adventurer NPCs who supposedly occupied the same in-fiction niche as PCs, did not follow the same rules as PCs to any degree; the stats weren't randomly generated, their items broke the rules for magic items, they had powers and spells not accessible to PCs, etc.</blockquote>\nI'm curious where that came from?

Oh, and in the Dragon, they started publishing new character classes as "NPC Only" without experience charts, but those weren't "official".<br/><br/>Frank<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448409/#Comment_448409" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-08T00:41:08+00:00" title="September  8, 2015 12:41AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, in AD&amp;D and BECMI, for example, stats for monsters were completely different from PCs.
