Back in 2006, I asked people if there were game design podcasts -- usually at podcast panels at cons or just talking with podcasters.  Everyone I asked said they didn't know of any.  So, I went and started up my own.  Now I'm starting to notice other podcasts that focus on design &amp; theory, specifically <a href="http://www.theoryfromthecloset.com/" rel="nofollow">Theory from the Closet</a> (which started around the same time my own <a href="http://masterplan.libsyn.com/" rel="nofollow">Master Plan</a> did), <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Canonpuncture" rel="nofollow">Canon Puncture</a> (which is not exclusively design/theory, but they're spending a good amount of time on the subject), and the "Pravda" segment on <a href="http://www.thevoiceoftherevolution.com/" rel="nofollow">The Voice of the Revolution</a>.<br/><br/>If you asked me a couple weeks back the same question, I would have told you that I only knew of my own podcast, Voice of the Revolution and Canon Puncture.  If you ask me now, I'd tell you that I only know those four podcasts listed above.  That leaves me to think -- no, hope -- that there are other podcasts on game design/theory out there, either as their main topic or as a decent-covered side-topic.<br/><br/>All four of these got going in 2007, or late enough in 2006 to not really count until 2007.  (I know Voice of the Revolution is older than that, but I'm just talking about the game design content.)  Each of them are rather different in content and presentation, so it's not just one guy biting off someone else's style.  That leads me to thinking about a crazy "gaming podcast critical mass" notion, but that's not really important.<br/><br/>Do you have a podcast where you talk about game design or theory?  Do you know of one?  Are you thinking about doing one?  Did someone dive into this topic some time ago and I'm just not aware of it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

They're funny. They've been going for about a year, and when I was in the planning stages for my podcast in November/December they started to cover Game Design. They're done with that now. They covered everything from a Traditional RPG perspective, pre-generated gamemaster plot, calling different types of gamers names, etc, so there are quite a few things I don't agree with, but they have some diamonds in there. One thing that comes to mind is their constantly preaching to judge what you are doing against what they call a theme document. A theme document being very similar in purpose to the Three Questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://bearsgrove.com" rel="nofollow">The Bears Grove</a>, has a guy that was involved in writing White Wolf's Changling, and Wraith. He used to go on sometimes about his present game design, "Lyrica," some of which was interesting, but I stopped listening. More often he would give long tours of some part of his setting <b>in character</b>, or other things that just didn't work for me personally.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://harpingmonkey.com" rel="nofollow">The Round Table</a>, which is part of the Harping Monkey shows, was doing world design last year after Gen Con, which might be considered closely related to game design. I'm not sure why these folks didn't make the jump with me from Windows to Linux....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
