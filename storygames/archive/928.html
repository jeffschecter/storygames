                    Saw <a href="http://parapublishing.com/sites/para/resources/statistics.cfm" rel="nofollow"> this link</a> via <a href="http://boingboing.net/" rel="nofollow">Boing Boing</a>. It's a collection of stats for the book publishing industry. Some interesting ones:
<blockquote><cite><b>Smaller Publishers and Self-Publishers</b><br/><br/>A. From a survey and Special Report. Early 1988. Ã‚Â©1998 Brenner Information Group. <a href="http://www.BrennerBooks.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.BrennerBooks.com</a><br/><br/>8. The typical independent publisher (indie) works 50 hours a week. [Many work "half days": 8 am to 8 pm. : ]<br/><br/>17. They pay an average of $276.25 for illustration on each book.<br/><br/>18. On average, they pay $465.17 for a simple cover design to as much as $3,533.26 for a complex cover design. Typical cover costs range $450 to $3,000.<br/><br/>19. Book design costs between $10 and $150 an hour.<br/><br/>20. They pay between $5 and $18 per page for interior page layout.<br/><br/>24. An average of 10 to 15 hours are spent designing a book cover.<br/><br/>25. On average, 61 hours are spent in the editing process.<br/><br/>26. On average, 29 hours are spent producing a news release for a new book.<br/><br/>27. Self publishers spend 52.4% of their book development budget writing a book (23.3% for fiction, 55.5% for nonfiction).<br/><br/>28. Graphic design consumes 13.5% of the budget for fiction titles and 3.7% of the budget for nonfiction titles.<br/><br/>29. Other than writing costs, small publishers spend most of their fiction title development budget in graphic design and illustration (13.5% and 20% respectively).<br/><br/>30. Other than writing costs, small publishers spend most of their nonfiction title development budget on illustration and page layout (7.5% and 8% respectively).<br/><br/>31. Advertising consumes most of the small publisher's marketing costs (36.5% for fiction titles, 29.8% for nonfiction titles).<br/><br/><b>Book Sales in the U.S.</b><br/><br/>A successful fiction book sells 5,000 copies.<br/>  --Authors Guild. <a href="http://www.authorsguild.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.authorsguild.org/</a><br/><br/>A successful nonfiction book sells 7,500 copies.<br/>  --Authors Guild. <a href="http://www.authorsguild.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.authorsguild.org/</a><br/><br/><b>Covers, Book</b><br/><br/>Everyone judges a book by its cover.<br/><br/>On the average, a book store browser spends eight seconds looking at the front cover and 15 seconds looking at the back cover.<br/><br/>Sales Reps show covers or jackets and give a sales pitch that averages 14 seconds.</cite></blockquote>
Not to mention chilling stats about literacy &amp; high school readership, and depressing ones about how over 20% of books are returned to their publisher by stores if they don't sell in 4 months.<br/><br/>Anyway. Interesting stuff.                </div>

                            29 hours working on the news release?!<br/><br/>And how many hours does it take to write a book? I don't see how the costs are covered for "Writing" when you "pay yourself".<br/><br/>Also, the monetary figures were right for 1988, not for today. It'd cost more in today's sums, taking these figures. But then again, the knowledge is more prevalent.                        </div>

                            I was confused by the dates for that section....at the top it said it was an 88 survey, but later it had stats for 97 in particular. *shrugs*<br/><br/>Also, I think the "Indie" publishers there aren't one-man operations - they have an avrg. revenue/employee stat of something like 90K, and an average of 7 published titles. <br/><br/>But I think the graphic design &amp; advertising stats are interesting.                        </div>

                            Yeah, this is referring to what I usually refer to as "small press" guys.  Basically take the internet start-up mentality and apply to publishing.  Chaos ensues.<br/><br/>Although the author's guild's numbers for what makes a 'successful' book is amusing. The specifics of a book don't matter -- if it's fiction, it's got to sell 5,000 copies or else it's a failure!                        </div>

Well, the recording and movie industries also behave that way. "If it isn't Platinum, it's a failure!" "If it doesn't make a 100 million in the US, it's a failure!" And so on...                        </div>

                            I used to work in publishing (in New Zealand - smaller market, so less economy of scale, but for probably the largest NZ publisher at the time) and the formula my managing editor used in deciding whether to publish a book was simply "Do we think we can sell 5000 of these?" And the reason for that was economic - that was the breakeven point for a major publisher publishing a web-offset-print book. (She gave no consideration to quality or longevity, which is probably one reason that that formerly succesful publishing house is no longer successful. But that's another story.)<br/><br/>I suspect that the numbers for POD and short-run are rather different.                        </div>

                            5000 is also a pseudo-standard minimum print run.  Less than 5000 isn't cost-effective on an offset press.  So that may figure in there.                        </div>
