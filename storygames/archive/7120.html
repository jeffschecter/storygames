The players have been complaining about it.  So, I'm setting up the next encounter to actually try and "kill" them.  Or rather, set it up so they would die under the system, but then they Exalt as Solars and kick the asses of the "bad guys".  <br/><br/>This is almost giving me a feeling of schadenfreude, except I know the players have basically asked for this.  Still, it feels wrong so how, yet all so good.<br/><br/>I can't wait to finish stating up the NPCs tonight.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158342/#Comment_158342" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-24T07:50:19+00:00" title="July 24, 2008  7:50AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe you should make things difficult for the <i>players </i>by giving the <i>characters </i>difficult choices to make.

It is statistically not likely.  And should they chose to run instead of fight there's a much higher chance of them all surviving (which I would neither penalize nor reward them for doing, given their motivations and intimacies and all that).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C.W.Richeson</cite>Sounds like fun, zenten.

That is the only way they will Exalt."  The only way I'm not living up to that is the challenges haven't been hard enough, and not for my lack of trying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DaveC" title="DaveC"><img alt="DaveC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DaveC">DaveC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158647/#Comment_158647" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T13:39:45+00:00" title="July 25, 2008  1:39PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not terribly familiar with the Exalted setting, so this might be a dumb question.
