                    After reading several threads here, I wrote this up, sort of as it occured to me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Creating a Character<br/>
<br/>
1) Determine the character's fundament - A character's fundament is basically any ideas expressed by answering several "fundamental questions" (asked by the GM, related to the genre, setting, and situation of the game). Basically, the fundamental questions are a way for the GM to say what is important for the game, and the fundamental answers are a way for the players to decide what is important to them from within that.<br/>
<br/>
2) Write down two "charged" traits - A trait can be anything that describes the character, including skills, attitudes, relationships, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Conflict Resolution<br/>
When two or more characters are in conflict over something, use the following steps to resolve who gets what they want.<br/>
<br/>
1) Set the stakes - decide what is at stake in the conflict; who gets what, should they win the conflict.<br/>
<br/>
2) Describe the actions - describe what your character is doing to to accomplish their goals.<br/>
<br/>
3) Determine success or failure - Flip a coin. If the result is heads, the player achieves their stakes, and their opponent doesn't. If the result is tails, the player loses their stakes, and their opponent achieves theirs.<br/>
<br/>
3a) If you succeeded on the flip and the conflict situation is related to the character's fundament, then you can "charge*" one of the character's traits by ignoring the success result and re-flipping the coin. The new result counts. The charged trait must somehow be applicable to the situation.<br/>
<br/>
3b) If you failed on the flip and the conflict situation is related to the character's fundament, then you can re-flip the coin if you "discharge" one of your "charged" traits. The discharged trait must somehow be applicable to the situation.<br/>
<br/>
4) The player narrates the success or failure, constrained by the stakes determined above.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*"Charging" a trait can involve creating an entirely new trait. It doesn't necessarily mean that the character just learned a new skill, but it does mean that some new part of the character was revealed. Could be he just never used the skill before, or the relationship never mattered before.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, what do you guys think? It's obviously very simple, but I think that it does a couple of neat things (trait charging/discharging, the fundament).                </div>

                            Can a trait have only one point of "charge" in it or can you repeatedly charge a trait, +1, +2, +3 etc. so that it's reusable?<br><br>I'd remove the "related to the character's fundament" requirement in 3b. After all, the player is paying for the flip so why add additional limitations?<br><br>It's simple and elegant. Very neat.                        </br></br></br></br></div>
