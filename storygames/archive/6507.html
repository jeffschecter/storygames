I've got a lot of ideas buzzing around in my head about demos, booth setup, and so forth, but the part I'm really interested in is the after hours gaming at the Embassy Suites.<br/><br/>I don't know about the rest of you, but I've had some seriously mixed experiences trying to play games at the Embassy, despite all the great gaming that I know happens there.  Often it's the result of timing (missing the start of games), not knowing people, or not being comfortable interrupting folks to see if I can join in.  <br/><br/>Anyway, I'd like to change all that this year by considering how some of us might come together to apply a bit of "informal structure" to the games, in a fashion similar to what happens at Nerdly or (from what I read) at NerdNYC Recess.  Here are a few ideas I'm considering:<br/><br/>- A loose schedule of games being run at specific times, with people who sign up before the con (perhaps using a wiki)<br/>- A sign-up board (game, table location, facilitator) in the lobby for ad-hoc games someone is willing to run <br/>- Materials to make table-tents with game names and player slots clearly visible<br/><br/>I'm interested in hearing from others about this, whether that's in the form of ideas and enthusiasm or criticism.  I recognize some folks like the evenings at the Embassy for just getting together with their friends and keeping their games under the radar, and that's cool.  What about the rest of you?<br/><br/><small>* Seriously, missing Nerdly <em>physically hurt me</em>.

There was a wiki and it allowed people who really wanted to run a particular game to make sure it happened.  Those games were listed on a sheet of poster paper, along with pick-up games that happened in the time slots as well.  I think the mix was pretty effective, but not perfect - some people have said they missed out on games.  <br/><br/>So the Embassy Suites gathering of the clan has a couple of facets that are different and noteworthy in my mind:<br/><br/>* It's a social event, where friends meet once per year to connect and have fun.<br/>* It's a place where people new to this kind of game can try them among friendly enthusiasts.<br/>* It's a place where seasoned story gamers get their story on in a serious way, so stand back.<br/>* It's an awkward gaming "meat market" where status factors into who gets into fun games and who gets left to make their own.<br/><br/>Some of that is great, some is awful, some unavoidable.  There's no way we can organize it, but I think it'd be great to<i> direct all that energy</i> toward positive ends.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144260/#Comment_144260" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T14:28:22+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  2:28PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last year, folks seemed to filter into key games, while others just sort of sat down and started playing.

People who were going to be your players may show up early and drift into another game, or get caught up late at dinner talking at the "table for 14" somewhere until finally showing up at like 9:30 or whatever.<br/><br/>My own idea, that I'm waffling with, once construction and all is done next year, is to assist the Games on Demand booth, and stretch it out several hours (until about 11PM at night): That way people could bring their food and non-alcoholic drinks*, and throw down at 6, at 8, at whenever. That would also be an area for socializin' and the like. The only drawbacks:<br/><br/>* Not near a bar. I like buying friends drinks.<br/>* Sometimes people game in rooms and stuff, and the gaming event hall doesn't have comfy couches.<br/>* Might be hard to "unwind" in an environment where everyone around you (around the GoD event area) is hardcore playing.<br/><br/>But I'm following this thread with interest, and will try to think of something; at least a way so that if someone wants something structured, they can get it: Be it a phone messaging/calendar network, or a Games on Demand sign up bulletin board, or whatnot. It probably can't have an online component, as people will mostly not have their PCs with them. <br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>*I'm totally bringing alcohol                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

Most people aren't like "I'm running X, who wants in?"  It's more like "John Harper promised me last year that he'd run Agon for me and he never did so THIS YEAR I'm going to jump him at Embassy Suites and make him do it, dammit.  And there's Clinton, I'm going to grab him and bring him in.  And I've always wanted to get to know person Y better, so I'll see if they want to play."  The way into the games is really to get to know people in the community and have enough connections that you can find something to play.  Or run something yourself and get to know people that way.  Commitments before people actually get there are always shakey at best, because nobody wants to decide to play one game if it means losing the opportunity to play in another game they're even more excited about.  Heck, I've shown up and been like, "Hey, do folks wanna play X?" and had people I know really well be like, "Nah, I'm gonna stick around and see if I can play X game with person Y."  And, often, hanging out and just talking to folks or watching a game one night can lead to playing in a different game the next night.  Like, I played The Roach with Marc Majcher at the GOD booth and then he ended up joining in this weird improv experiment with Em, James, and me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144337/#Comment_144337" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T19:12:24+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  7:12PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like Justin, I had awful luck at Embassy Suites in 2007.  I only played in one RPG there, and that was  a pre-scheduled game.  So, I'm all for some organization going in.  I mean, I'm sure its all well and good for the people who know each other, but ES was pretty lonely for us noobs (not saying Justin is a noob, because he isn't... ok maybe I was the only noob).  <br/><br/>One night I actually spent half an hour walking around with my bag full of RPG books and my lappy looking for anyone to even make eye contact.  Another night, Daniel Solis was nice enough to play a board game with me, then I sat and watched Farscape over the Poisoned group (the big TV was somewhat behind them).  So I for one, despised the setup of ES in regards to me getting to game.  I loved meeting lots of cool people off the con floor, though, that was cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144345/#Comment_144345" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T20:27:23+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  8:27PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had nothing but awesome experiences at ES at GenCon.<br/><br/>But then, they've all been scheduled games through ENWorld/Circvs Maximvs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144370/#Comment_144370" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-16T04:45:04+00:00" title="May 16, 2008  4:45AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2008 7:30AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had the best game of the con last year after I told myself "fuck it" and grabbed four people I didn't really know milling around Embassy Suites and set up a game with them.  <br/><br/>As it currently exists, the after hours scene at Gen Con is the universal epicenter and embodiment of everything I hate about status games within our community.

In fact, I encourage it.<br/><br/>Somebody better run a session of Sorcerer so I can finally play that game... dammit.<br/><br/>Andrew                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144387/#Comment_144387" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-16T07:25:37+00:00" title="May 16, 2008  7:25AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Using Games On Demand as a sort of organizational entity for after hours gaming is a wonderful idea.

Set stuff up in advance if you want.<br/><b><br/>2.  People really only want to play with their best pals sometimes, and not Internet mopes.</b><br/><br/>My suggestion - don't play in a public area.  <br/><br/><b>3.  People are Internet mopes and don't know anybody.  </b><br/><br/>My suggestions - be welcoming and kind.  Make it a point to corral people you don't know into your sessions.  Reject status games.  Create social networks.  I f you are one of these people, go make a friend at the Forge booth and environs.

There are people who don't like to ask, because it seems rude. They like to be invited. There are people who like to ask, because who does it hurt to say no? They don't wait around to be invited. These two groups of people don't understand each other.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna tackle the getting-people-into-games issue right now. I want to tackle a bigger problem of making people feel included as part of "the group," which is a fictional concept that doesn't exist. <br/><br/><b>Every single person should take responsibility for introducing the people they know.</b> If you know Rich and he doesn't know other people, introduce him to the people you know. Then Rich has a social connection to those people and he can ask them if they're running games and they can invite him and stuff. If no one introduces Rich, he's a random gamer wandering around the lounge and, people being people, he has a smaller chance of getting invited into games because he' s a total stranger.<br/><br/>That rule up there about introducing people? It's not only basic common sense, it's also considered "proper etiquette," i.e. polite behavior. It's rude not to introduce people when they're standing next to you. Let's not be like that.<br/><br/>I drove up to Dreamation with Dave Cleaver and Daniel Levine (different than the Daniel who posted above). Dave knows everyone already, pretty much. Daniel hadn't met any of those people before. I made it my quest to introduce him to many, many people. I hope he had more fun as a result.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144551/#Comment_144551" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-16T14:34:12+00:00" title="May 16, 2008  2:34PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Take a night out of your con to only play with people you've never played with before. </blockquote>\nI did this last year and, as I mentioned up-thread, it was the best game of the con.

This involved tackling Andy K and begging him to let me play his game which he was nice enough to let me do and then similarly gut punching Matt Gandy until he let me play Seiyuu.<br/><br/>There was only one problem.  I knew Andy from interviewing him on Canon Puncture, but <b>I still felt like I was intruding</b> and that I think is the one problem with people asking to game.<br/><br/>Ben, I naturally assume you have a full schedule so I'm not going to feel comfortable asking.  Same with Jason and Judd and everyone else.  The only reason I begged my way into the games I did was because Andy happened to be standing close to me when he mentioned the game and I believe I interrupted a conversation he was having.<br/><br/>I feel like there's wisdom here.  Perhaps it's that we need to ensure that as we move towards Gen Con that we get the word out that's okay to ask and the whole introduction/meet people thing is a good idea.  However, I am wondering what time I should show up?  When does it start?

This is Ask Culture.<br/><br/>  In Guess Culture, you avoid putting a request into words unless you're pretty sure the answer will be yes. Guess Culture depends on a tight net of shared expectations. A key skill is putting out delicate feelers. If you do this with enough subtlety, you won't even have to make the request directly; you'll get an offer. Even then, the offer may be genuine or pro forma; it takes yet more skill and delicacy to discern whether you should accept.<br/><br/>  All kinds of problems spring up around the edges. If you're a Guess Culture person ... then unwelcome requests from Ask Culture people seem presumptuous and out of line, and you're likely to feel angry, uncomfortable, and manipulated.<br/><br/>  If you're an Ask Culture person, Guess Culture behavior can seem incomprehensible, inconsistent, and rife with passive aggression.<br/><br/>  Thing is, Guess behaviors only work among a subset of other Guess people -- ones who share a fairly specific set of expectations and signalling techniques. The farther you get from your own family and friends and subculture, the more you'll have to embrace Ask behavior.  Otherwise you'll spend your life in a cloud of mild outrage at (pace Moomin fans) the Cluelessness of Everyone. -- posted by tangerine at 11:38 PM PST on January 16<br/></blockquote>\nNeither is wrong, but the interactions can lead to sadness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144778/#Comment_144778" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T02:53:02+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  2:53AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can I throw an even more difficult spanner in the works?<br/>\n<br/>\nI couldn't even find the place last year. I looked. But my map-fu failed me terribly.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's how I see it - for 51 weeks of the year, here and on other forums, we read about these Embassy Suite nights. We read about the great people and the great games and the coming together of the indie/story/hippy clan for a few days.  It is talked about like the epicentre of all things cool and hot and rocking. If you can make it there, you'll make it anywhere! (If you can feckin find the place!)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless of whether you like, dislike, buy-into or reject notions like 'status games', as a new attendee to this arena you are walking into a real thorny problem. You have a place where a lot of people know a lot of other people, intimately, and you cannot discern those networks. You have a load of people who you know only as their internet tags and personas, rather than as real people. You have a bunch of people who are constantly being feted on these boards for their cool games, their cool GMing and their cool gameplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo on, dive in, make yourself at home - what could go wrong........? (famous last words)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here's what I would do.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Make sure that everyone knows where to go. Have a map available as a flyer to everyone who comes to the Forge booth, Ashcan Front/Play Collective and Games on Demand (and other affiliate booths)<br/>\n2. If you demo to someone, personally invite them to ES and let them know what sort of stuff goes on. The more people that turn up the more likelihood people will not be left alone, the more likely that new groups of friends will form.<br/>\n3. Have a selection of volunteer GMs who will 'mop up' the new people each night. On other nights they can play with their mates, but on one night they have the task to induct the new players into the clan.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, if the event is ran as an informal throwdown gaming session around a bar with an extended group of friends, then its very difficult to stick any structure or imperative onto people to act in a certain fashion. If it becomes too formal then it ceases being fun. If you pitch a middle ground, it could work. Or be a mess. YMMV.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can't make GenCon this year, but I intend to be back, so at least sort the map out .... or get a neon sign? &lt;grin&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144786/#Comment_144786" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T06:19:27+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  6:19AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, so I'm doing layout for the Indie Game Passport this year, which could conceivable mention and give directions to the ES afterplay thingee.  The problem is, that by including that info in the passport I (or we, the people involved in the passport) would be arbitrarily changing the nature of something that was happening years before I was ever a part of it.  It changes what started as a relatively private get-together for the folks working at the Forge Booth into a public event.  And, like the thorny evolution of Game Chef from being a contest within the limited community of the Forge to being an open event, that's liable to change a lot of things.  Are we prepared for that?  Because, if not, that just means that, afterwards, we're going to be having painful discussions where we thrash ourselves for not being open enough or reminisce fondly about the lost golden days of ES games of the past.  Also, I'm pretty damned sure that I don't want to openly publicize those games without a general consensus from those people who've been involved with it in the past, so they don't hate me forever for "ruining" a good thing.  Like all major changes, this isn't going to work for everyone, many people are going to end up unhappy with it, and, most likely, the first few years we try it in a new format, it may totally suck for many of those folks most closely involved with it in the past.  But if we think we're ready for that...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144787/#Comment_144787" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T06:23:49+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  6:23AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Additionally: one of the reasons that ES works is that it's not a public event.  It's slower and, often, quieter (volume wise) than most of what happens at GenCon.  It's a place to relax, where there's enough people that you can find people to hang / play with, but no so many that it's super-crowded and you're lost in a sea of people.  The sense I have is that it's already changing in this regard, that each year is louder and more crowded than the last and there's less space to actually find a free table and play.  Ultimately, we will probably have to deal with this at some point, one way or the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[GenCon 2008] Embassy Nights - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6507/gencon-2008-embassy-nights/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[GenCon 2008] Embassy Nights - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6507/gencon-2008-embassy-nights/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="You know I'm all for putting a note on there.

The only thing is that in reality, the Embassy Suites is not our private playspace. Some folks just end up meeting there and hanging out, doing some gaming. There's LOTS of folks that show up there, not just "us": Last year there were a bunch of independent tables doing Starcraft Board Game marathons and the like. I want to allow all to come, but I'm not sure I want to promise gaming on an open invitation: It feels like inviting strangers to someone else's house, and taking advantage of one hotel's niceness in leaving a common area open.<br/><br/>Ex: What if this or next year we get there only to find that because of noise issues or whatever they close off the dining area after hours? I mean, sure, speculating about possibles is pretty empty and all that. But in the end, there's something that we have to balance. Well, there's lots of issues, but one that kinda matter to me is:<br/><br/>* I'd like to see more people come, hang out, play or whatever.<br/>* And yet, it's not our place. We're infringing on the hospitality of Embassy Suites. If we rented a convention room/play space at ES, I can totally thumbs-up get behind putting that up on a flyer or whatever. But since we're basically busting into a free area, it's more like inviting strangers into someone else's living room (or holding a concert in a public park after hours without a permit) , without their knowledge or explicit consent, and hoping/wishing this doesn't cause a problem.<br/><br/>I like the idea of folks organizing ways to meet up and play after hours, at ES or wherever. I'm not all that cool with exploiting ES's hospitality as if it were a given.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144799/#Comment_144799" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T07:28:32+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  7:28AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This may sound overly simplistic, but it worked amazing for me and I played many games at the Embassy Suites with many people I had never played with before.<br/><br/>Jungle Speed<br/><br/>I know Jungle Speed has a lot of baggage. And when people play it too aggressively they scare others away. But when played for fun where losing is as much fun as winning, it's awesome because:<br/><br/>- games last 5-10 minutes<br/>- you can scale between 2-8+ players easily<br/>- and rotate players in and out easily<br/>- you aren't playing a character <br/>- talking gentle trash is a great ice breaker<br/>- even if you are color blind and un-coordinated (many people were), just incorporate those details into your trash talking<br/>- people watching you or talking to you while you play (unlike most RPGs) is part of the fun!<br/>- increase your energy levels which is a great way to prime for playing an RPG after a long day of running around<br/><br/>This is part of the reason why Jungle Speed became so popular at our local East Coast cons. Strangers could join in easily. And then we gained enough of a connection that it made it super easy to split up into RPG groups with new people.<br/><br/>I'm also a huge fan of no pre-planning. No schedules. No pre-registration. For me, what works best is ice breaker games, signs indicating when there are open spots in games, shorter games so you can rotate people in and out easily, and people keeping their eyes out for stragglers and trying to get them into games. <br/><br/>Rock,<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144801/#Comment_144801" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T07:45:11+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  7:45AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, you raise an important point.

Being up front and prepared will only make it easier to attract commitments to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144803/#Comment_144803" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T07:48:18+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  7:48AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, Andy's points are important.

Let people figure out there's gaming there on their own. Once they're there, let's make people feel welcome into our games, whoever they are.<br/><br/>None of this really addresses the fact that there's nothing wrong with a bunch of good friends (who see each other once or twice a year and who are busy otherwise during the day) finding a table in the lounge of their hotel and gaming together. Exclamations of "get a room" don't necessarily play. Rooms often don't have a suitable gaming table. Rooms are sometimes shared by people not involved in the game. The lounge is an amenity for use by the hotel's patrons, so Embassy Suites customers can expect to use the lounge for their <i>private</i> gaming without being rude. Use of a "public" (really, "shared") space does not mean you have to open your game to the public, or that keeping your game private is rude.<br/><br/>Also, until we start designing games that can seat more than 4-6 players, games are going to continue to "exclude" people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144818/#Comment_144818" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T08:33:53+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  8:33AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about a flag or something that indicates that you're looking for people to join the game so that when people approach to ask if they can get in they're not being intrusive?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144819/#Comment_144819" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T08:46:49+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  8:46AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Adam, I totally agree with you about private and public.

That started because alot of people who had great game play started talking how much fun it was, and alot of other people (understandably) wanted to share in the fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut ultimately the ES get together began as a way for people who worked together hard all day at the Forge Booth could finally get some gaming in after hours.  We could play full games of the games we'd just been demoing.  We could learn more about the games we'd be selling the next day, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn such an environment there really wasn't any "I don't know anyone, I'm having trouble getting into a game" stuff.  If you can go an entire day working the Forge Booth with 20-30 other people rotating in and out...and NOT get to know any of them enough to be comfortable scheduling a game with them...that's your own problem.  Many of the games being played at ES were scheduled ad hoc during business hours at the booth..."after dinner lets meet up at the Embassy to play X".<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the "diaspora" we now have seperate booths for the Ashcan Front, Play Collective, Burning Wheel et.al.  but the concept is still the same.  People who worked nearly all day on the dealer floor want to have some time to actually play.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow here's my 2 cents.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHAT'S what the Embassy Suites are FOR (and here I mean the concept of evening play that historically has just happened to occur at the ES).  If you aren't a booth person (at whatever booth), if you didn't just spend 6-8 hours on your feet shilling and roping and talking and demoing and selling...then IMO, your needs / wants / desires are secondary.<br/>\n<br/>\nNOT because you're not important, or because you're an outsider, or because you don't have "status" as a designer or any of that bullshit.  But because you have an entire 4 days at the largest gaming convention in North America to play whatever you want, whenever you want: offical GenCon scheduled games, pick up games, meet up games planned with people on line (like RPG.net folks do every year).<br/>\n<br/>\nThose of us who work the booths all day, don't have that opportunity.  The Embassy Suites is often the only shot we have to actually play games...not demo...not running a scehduled session, not working G.O.D...but to just sit down and enjoy play.  I'm sorry if this sounds selfish...but this is OUR time to game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are some non-booth-working-folks who manage to get into a few games and enjoy themselves...fantastic...welcome and glad to have you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if there are some non-booth-working-folks who feel left out...IMO...sorry, but you aren't the target audience for this event.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are some booth-working folks who feel left out...I don't know what to say about that, but making sure to do some more connecting with the people you're working with, and doing a little quick scheduling during working hours should take care of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly for me...the moment booth working people have trouble getting a game because the ES is filled with non-booth-working people wanting to play too...that's the moment it fails utterly.  I'm not trying be exclusionary here, just recognizing the fact that for the last 7 years the ONLY gaming I get to do at GenCon happens at the Embassy Suites.  That's why I'm there every night gaming.<br/>\n<br/>\nNon-booth-working-folks need to be a little bit considerate about this as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144828/#Comment_144828" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T09:08:19+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  9:08AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2008 9:10AM by Andy.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            CW Richeson locked down a room one of the hotels for night gaming, for an RPGNet meetup on Saturday night until 12 at night.

You might accept that there is a massive storygames clique and ES is its gathering place? You might try to help these newcomers? You might not.<br/>\n<br/>\nShall I be honest about why I might sound a little skittish here? Last year I managed to get exactly zero demos from the Forge (every time I wanted a demo of a game, there was no-one available to handle it), one excellent but rushed game from GoD (TLBs PTA game in 90 minutes.) and never got to find the Embassy Suites as said before.

It is also the time to game of residents of Embassy Suites, who show up with their board games, card game, etc. (more and more, I noticed, over the years; perhaps inspired by seeing a bunch of others loitering around and playing games: For that, I'm glad!).<br><br>Anyway, in the end, if someone comes along, and I'm sitting there on my butt with a beer in the middle of a conversation, and someone cruises by without doing introductions (though how would they know us, and we them? That's a question), I have no idea if they're looking for the Hot After-Hours Gaming, if they're looking for their roommates who are in the back playing Starcraft: The Board Game. if they're just there to get a beer before they head back to their room, or if they just heard the noise and were attracted to see what was going on.<br><br>I don't want to be all hard and be like, "There's No Cliques! Other folks are not responsible for you being an introvert! We're not psychic, and don't know if you're standing near me without saying "hi" because you want in, or if you're there because we're just something to stare at while you kill time because your roommates are having sex and you can't get into your room", but I <i>would</i> say, "If you show up, and see people who you think might be playing some of those games (or talking, whatever), and want 'in', say Hi and introduce yourself... because the others really have no idea if you are there to participate, or are waiting for friends, just there for beer and nachos, whatever".<br><br>And on the other side, sounds like Jason might be thinking of getting a few people who are interested in helping other out, wear little badges or something to make themselves accessible. Or coordinate with the G.O.D bulletin board. I don't see any harm in that. Just as long as we remember that we don't own that space, and the best way to be able to tell who's being included and who's being excluded is to move to a private space, where all who walk through the door are welcomed with a roar and ushered into a free game.<br><br>I'm interested more and more in helping make this happen. I'll keep an eye on folks' ideas.  This year things are hamstringed because official planning/schedules are posted (and thus we probably can't extend GOD to night), and because there's the perpetual construction going on which is going to reduce event space to a fraction of what it normally is.<br><br>I'll look into that gaming room idea. In the meantime, feel free to shake folks' hands and tell them that there's usually gaming at ES, but just that they'll need to look for us and introduce themselves so we know they're not there for something else. There's social fixes and conventions that can be implemented without having to fall back to rules.<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144843/#Comment_144843" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T09:28:35+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  9:28AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for weighing in, Shreyas.  It makes me sad that this topic has brought up to much acrimony and push-back.  My core interest is making it a welcoming space for new people, and facilitating a lot of great games, which can't be that weird an interest to have.  <br><br>I guess we have different ideas about what constitutes an official thing.  Is the passport an official thing, or is it a marketing tool thrown together by a few booths?  Maybe we're both right.  Pointing people to where the games are played doesn't seem like a huge transgression.  It's hard to be welcoming when you have people like Neil (who is a stand-up dude) unable to even find it.  Or the various people who've said they had a hard time finding a game in a big room full of gamers - can't we fix that, or even try?  <br><br>I already recognized that we're sort of mis-using the space to begin with, and I don't have a short-term solution for that.

IMO and all that, anyway. When I was with the Forge Booth, I told about everyone with ears who was into the games about the ES gaming. Last year, I personally invited about a dozen people (from all my G.O.D slots and the like: Few showed up, but at least when I saw their faces I knew it was for the gaming/talks, and not because they were there for late night munchies only). Double thumbs up on inviting people. Inviting everyone. Everyone you see. Excluding no one. Personally. By word of mouth.<br><br>Putting it on paper, though, I'm with Shreyas: Imagine it got back to the Embassy Suites staff that there's a flyer going around telling folks to crash the... well, I imagine they're making a lot off the beer and sodas and munchies they're selling, but it might make things complicated. If anything, on the passport/equivalent, I'd like write in fine print somewhere at the bottom that "sometimes some folks can be found around the ES lobby at night: Say hi and maybe play!". But I would be against making it into a "stamp".\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>As far as I know, Games on Demand isn't running all night.  Correct me if I'm wrong.

I'm thinking of assisting next year to help register/staff it for evenings.<br><br>Here's the tricks:<br>Apparently last year, after the GOD area was "closed", there weren't any events at those tables, anyway. So we pretty much could have used them throughout the night.<br>"Yay! We might expect that this year, too!" <br>Probably not, because of the construction and limited space this year (IIRC, someone said something like only 40-50% of the space last year will be usable this year because of rennovations). I'm sure that at 6:01 or whenever the tables are officially closed (it was either 4:00 or 6:00, I forget which), there's likely to be events going down on those tables once we pack up the green felt tabletop things.<br>If not, though? Then cool, we then officially have a hook-up and play spot.<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144849/#Comment_144849" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T09:39:51+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  9:39AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2008 9:41AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neil Gow</cite>Valamir's description - if thats the case, then I hold my hands up and say 'cool beans'.

It probably should run all night, but I'm not the guy to ask.</p>\n<p>Personally, I'm of the opinion that if you think something <em>might</em> be transgressive, and you're living in someone's hospitality and not your own space, you shouldn't do it; it's more important to be a good guest. I see that you're thinking of yourself as a host, trying to set up a welcoming atmosphere, but <em>that's not what you are</em> in this situation. If you formally set up an event and define a space and own that space, that's one thing, and that's a good course of action, but putting up advertisements that make it appear that you own a place, when in fact you are a guest in that hotel, is not a thing that you should do.</p>\n<p><em>Is the passport an official thing, or is it a marketing tool thrown together by a few booths?</em></p>\n<p>Uh, what? This is like, "Is a banana a thing you can eat, or is it a fruit?" If it's a thing that's put together by a couple of booths that own space in the convention, then that implies that it's talking about space, topics, events, whatever, that are owned by those booths. It's a thing that <em>looks</em> official; the way you, as a person who saw it come together, perceive it, doesn't matter. It matters how a random congoer will see it, and if that random congoer gets a piece of advertising swag from a booth and it says, "Come play games with us at ES!" then they will think, "Oh, there's a GenCon event at ES in the evening! Cool!"</p>\n<p>I mean, seriously. Listen to Ben. He is a smart guy who is saying a thing that makes sense. If you want to play with people, ask them to play. You've got the social skills to communicate to people, "I'm maybe open to joining some people to play in the evening." Use your words instead of hiding behind gamer-systems, and you'll be doing everyone a favor.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144852/#Comment_144852" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T09:45:42+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  9:45AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Furthermore, being too welcoming is dangerous, again 'cause you're running on someone else's hospitality.

I completely recognize that this "event" is just the time and place where long-time Forge folks go to unwind and get their game on.  I don't want to screw that up for anybody.<br><br>That said, a lot of other folks have caught on that there is good indie gaming happening at the Suites, and those folks (including me) have come looking for the fun.

If folks are interested, I'm happy to put some together with some markers and bring them along.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>If you can go an entire day working the Forge Booth with 20-30 other people rotating in and out...and NOT get to know any of them enough to be comfortable scheduling a game with them...that's your own problem.  Many of the games being played at ES were scheduled ad hoc during business hours at the booth..."after dinner lets meet up at the Embassy to play X".</blockquote>\nIt <i>can</i> happen that someone works in the Forge booth all day and doesn't get a chance to make plans for gaming- I've seen it.  If you're busy enough, and you don't already know folks, it's not terribly difficult to be standing in the booth after closing up and realize everyone is gone off to dinner and you haven't made plans yet.  But you're right, that is my problem, which is why I'm considering solutions.   <br><br>If it helps, think of this thread- and whatever other online solutions we might adopt- to be a way for some folks to make that "after dinner" gaming plan ahead of time.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144927/#Comment_144927" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T13:36:09+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  1:36PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2008 1:37PM by Andy.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Segedy</cite>to be a way for some folks to make that "after dinner" gaming plan ahead of time.</blockquote>\nOh, I think I mention it elsewhere, but that's another groovy set of factors. Dinner.<br/><br/>Back in the day, I loved treating dinner as a social event. "Oh, I simply *must* go to dinner with X and Y". 4 people turns into 7, turns into 10, turns into 14.<br/><br/>Then you have 14 people waiting for a group table at PF Changs behind, Everyone Else at the Con.<br/><br/>Dinner goes down: It is social, friendly, fun, and everything that was hoped for and expected.<br/><br/>But then when it's over: "Shit, it's 9:30 already. Play something *now*? That would keep me up far too late, I might as well sit around and talk, sleep, whatever".<br/><br/>Anyway, that's something else to remember.<br/><br/>Personally, if I do something social I do it for lunch, and then dinner becomes me running to Jimmy John's for one of their awesome subs, so that I can make it to an event or random gaming throwdown before it's too late. I'm in the middle of an event, and see you coming in late, wanting to throw down... ...but alas, me and these other guys here ate early, formed up and started playing an hour ago; and the next group of dinner stragglers won't arrive for another 30-60 minutes, so you're kinda screwed.<br/><br/>Sounds kinda specific, like a corner case, but it happens All The Time. I've seen folks complain that nothing's open (game session-wise), when in truth it was because they opted to do the big group dinner thing and came back after 9:00, while others ate a powerbar/pizza slice/salad, chugged a coffee, hit a quick shower and are throwing down at the Embassy at 7:00.<br/><br/>Just another random piece of data related to social evenings at the Con. I'd almost not bring it up if I hadn't seen it happen constantly, every year, for some 3-4 years. Something to keep on the brain.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144933/#Comment_144933" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-19T13:39:56+00:00" title="May 19, 2008  1:39PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve, sorry I went bananas all over your thread.

While it seems like we're past the part where we share experiences and into trying to solve a problem, what the hell, I'll post mine.<br/><br/>So, last year, I bombed around ES at various points.  I got to chat with folks I haven't seen in far too long &amp; some I finally got to meet that con, I got to introduce myself to Luke Crane &amp; got an interview, imbibed copious amounts of alcohol.  However, not wanting to be a tool treading on someone else's fun, I rarely walked up to folks I vaguely knew, and even rarer did I do that while they were fucking gaming.  Then comes Sunday, and I haven't gotten any gaming in yet.  I'm at the ES around, I dunno, maybe 7.  Clearly, it's early.  People are tired from the con -- I sat down in one of those comfy chair areas with five other dudes there -- some of the BW peeps -- and no one was talking.  We were all fucking spent.<br/><br/>Then I see my con-roommate walk by (Ram Hull), and I get up from the quiet zone and we talk.  We sat down in another set of comfy chairs, and he talked about how he just bought Spirit of the Century.  Then another roommate, Chris Perrin, sat down next to us.  I think that's when I said "Fuck it, you want learn how to play?  Get some paper."  Steve Segedy &amp; Josh Hoade popped by, and Chris left to go be a dirty commie or something in Andy's game*.  And we start playing, running one of my "teach the rules, do chargen, play game in two hours" games.  No plan, just made the damn game up on the fly.  As people filtered in, we were met by folks, so clearly shit was going to go on.  But you know what?  I had no idea of that.  I had no idea if people were just tired, or if they were just doing a late, chill dinner.  I had no idea who wanted to play a game and who didn't.  I was in an information black hole, and just finally made some shit happen.<br/><br/>The moral I walked away with:  If you're just <em>hoping</em> shit happens in an environment like ES, where there's no rhyme, reason, planning, etc., you might strike gold or you might fuck yourself.  And if you go in trying to see how the culture works -- especially if you don't really know people or only know them online &amp; not what they look like in person -- well, you probably don't know who to approach.  My problem last year was less being unsure if I could approach and just not knowing <em>who</em> to approach.  So, if you're just going to say "Hey, some folks play games at ES, check it out!" then you're not solving the problem at all.<br/><br/>But, if you set up planning things, are you not just getting the word out to people who already know the deal with ES?  If we tell folks here "Hey, go to GoD &amp; do some planning there," isn't that really only telling those who already "in the know"?  I'm not saying it's a bad idea -- I'm all for increasing information -- but I question it working &amp; I see it as being inconvenient due to location.  If we set up something more, like some sort of unofficial event, then you have to have people "working" it in order to make it function.  Who wants to do that during their off-time?<br/><br/>So, some people had shitty times.  Before that game, I was one of them.  Whose responsibility was it to deal with that?

His notes were:<br/><br/>Radisson guest room (I was there: It was a large room, with about 20 tables; there weren't too many of us but it could definitely seat about 80), from 5PM-12AM, for about $160 (but that probably could have been negotiated to less). Some factors:<br/>Catering prices are damned expensive (we didn't have anything last year, just water)<br/>You aren't allowed to bring in outside food (technically, that is: Many people brought baggies/sandwiches, etc).<br/><br/>So there's a thought: If anyone wants to call the Radisson and rack up a quiet, organized gaming area for an evening; it's about 1-2 blocks from the convention center (about the same distance as Embassy Suites from GC), and that might come out to like $5 per head for about 6 hours of evening gaming in a quiet, elegant area. Not sure people want to show up at GC just to pay More Money, but if someone's hellbent on making it happen, they can do so.<br/><br/>I'm waffling on it (for maybe one evening: Fri? Thurs?)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I see a radical de-cooling of the Embassy Suites phenomenon, not because there are new people (at all!) but because somehow there's evolved a feeling of exclusion that means that they can't come over, drop into a game, and play, just like everyone else is doing. Just like every designer does when they're wandering around wondering if their friends are still at dinner, or if they started the game already. You look around, see people playing something you like, eavesdrop (it's a public space. That's OK.), and see if you can get into that game with the dude you saw buying Sorcerer yesterday, or that chick with the crazy ideas in Universalis at GoD.</p>\n<p>This feeling of exclusion is not coming from people running games or showing up to play with their friends. It's happening because new people are showing up and expecting to be provided with fun, rather than making it with other similarly-enthused people. These are independent games. The hierarchy is wholly fictional and based on an imaginary designer/enthusiast split. We make our own games, from typesetting and marketing decisions to who we play with.</p>\n<p>You're here on Story Games. You're showing up at Embassy Suites. That means "We" means "You." There is no difference at the table between an established member of the community, a designer, and someone who loves this stuff and wants to meet people. Those are heavily overlapping categories.</p>\n<p>You're <em>there</em> to meet people. They don't know yet that they want to meet you.

I certainly think it's a good idea to encourage anybody who comes to the Embassy to be pro-active and make sure they meet folks and have fun.  But again, the Embassy Suites gaming is not a formal event in any way- it's simply a convenient place that a bunch of folks know in common, so gaming happens there.   While I don't think we need to beat the bushes and recruit folks, I say feel free to talk about it all you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/commondialog" title="commondialog"><img alt="commondialog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/commondialog">commondialog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146700/#Comment_146700" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-29T12:00:41+00:00" title="May 29, 2008 12:00PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve,<br/><br/>Good point to keep in mind.
