I only know about large-scale rubber-sword boffer LARPs, but myself and my wife used to run the kid's plot for the <a href="https://www.lorientrust.com/" rel="nofollow">Lorien Trust</a>, the UK's largest LARP. We'd often have 30+ kids taking part on adventures, the younger ones accompanied by parents.<br/><br/>In my experience, writing adventures for kids isn't too hard - just make sure goodies and baddies are at all times obvious. Usually, this is done by giving them a non-fighting adult to escort, who can point them in the right direction. Make lots of big, not-too scary monsters they can happily destroy <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Also, make sure anyone who has to be child-protection vetted, has been, and keep a first-aider on hand as well as a really good supply of things to drink.<br/><br/>Finally, if you're going to be doing live-action sword larp, and you're male - make sure you wear groin protection! Kids naturally hit at waist level and they don't hold back!<br/><br/>Also, advice for playing a monster: dress in make-up and cool costumes, snarl a lot, boast a lot (think pro wrestling), and die spectacularly in slow-motion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429665/#Comment_429665" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-20T04:28:23+00:00" title="March 20, 2014  4:28AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>dress in make-up and cool costumes, snarl a lot, boast a lot (think pro wrestling), and die spectacularly in slow-motion.</blockquote>\nThat's just good regular life advice.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429670/#Comment_429670" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-20T06:37:55+00:00" title="March 20, 2014  6:37AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sea Dracula                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429677/#Comment_429677" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-20T12:03:37+00:00" title="March 20, 2014 12:03PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know that <a href="http://jayshaffstall.com/blog/a-birthday-larp/" rel="nofollow">Jay Shaffstall has been running children's larps</a> at Origins for the last several years (and plans to do so again this year.

There was a fair amount of negotiation and while no-one had a set role, it wouldn't have taken much to turn it in to a more LARP like experience. <br/><br/>Other times I've seeded the area with young leaders or guiders who have set roles and interact with the groups as they arrive at them. <br/><br/>As mentioned, the trick is to keep it simple, the kids will over complicate it all by themselves. Make it interesting and as physical as possible, if you can use multiple locations go for it. Don't be tempted to make it too long, specifically have 'outs' in case they've just missed it. A bit of competition works well, but don't make it too cut throat.<br/><br/>A little goes a long way, I ran a game in my wife's home village with the whole village as the backdrop, they were groups of investigators looking in to a hit and run incident. They had clues that they had to physically go to check out so they could verify alibis It didn't hurt that we had access to a garage with a motorbike in it and an old carriage house with a car in the downstairs and rickety stairs up to a dark and dusty loft. They ended discovering a dead body (a set of overalls stuffed with newspaper in the loft) and the hidden treasure (sweets, never a mistake to put a prize at the end to guarantee a positive review!). Again, they really got in to it and it was something they talked about for ages.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429771/#Comment_429771" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-23T11:54:48+00:00" title="March 23, 2014 11:54AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.

In Denmark, fantasy and role-play is a year-round obsession. It\u2019s called larp\u2014it used to be an acronym for Live Action Role Playing, but is popular enough that it entered the language as a standard noun (or verb)\u2014and it is said to be the third most popular pastime in the kingdom, behind soccer and handball, but ahead of basketball and everything else. According to Lizzie Stark, author of Leaving Mundania, a book about larp culture in the U.S. as well as Scandinavia, Denmark is the global hotspot for the activity, with over 100,000 participants.
