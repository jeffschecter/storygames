We had a couple of alright sessions with <i>Breaking the Ice</i>, but it wasn't all that satisfying, and she's actually pretty good creatively-speaking. I think mostly it's because there's little actual conflict there to work through. The drama just didn't happen. (Shooting the Moon seems much more grabby).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, both my missus and my little brothers have broken their proper gaming teeth on <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> (on seperate occasions with veteran gamers present), and that went down much better.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor one-on-one games I would indeed offer up <i>Trollbabe</i>, or perhaps <i>Beast Hunters</i> if she doesn't mind more serious confrontation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191597/#Comment_191597" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-08T19:54:25+00:00" title="February  8, 2009  7:54PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: oreso</cite>broken their [. . . ] teeth</blockquote>Cut.

Forget "the simple system for newbs" angle--find something she enjoys, then  choose a game which tightly integrates its system to its setting, and roll with it. Remember: you were once a "newb" non-gamer, and you somehow figured out how to play shit like OD&amp;D or Hero System.<br><br>I guess I'm just saying don't be prejudicial. My first serious girlfriend (16 y.o.) back in 1988 learned Pendragon in a matter of hours of actual play, and totally dug the game's focus on really simulating the Arthurian legends and lifestyle. If I met a woman into westerns, I'd be rolling DitV out without a question.<br/><br/>All that said...

Not that I don't think she can learn complex systems, but with someone who isn't sure if they like roleplaying, it seems better to get them a taste quick rather than have to master a tome before they play. Whereas I got into roleplaying because I dug the whole tome-mastering thing.<br/><br/>She's more into sci-fi (ST, SW, Firefly, BSG) than anything else, so I suppose a one-on-one SF game would be best; in fact, we could play BtI as two starfleet officers or something, but I think that would be even harder for her, too much like fanfic. In her own words, "I draw the line at Star Trek novels."<br/><br/>In any case, we're finally playing this morning as soon as she gets back from an errand, so we'll see how it goes.<br/><br/>Oh, and Emily: Thanks for that link, I was looking for something just like it. I must have missed it when I looked through the Forge AP stuff after I bought the game.
