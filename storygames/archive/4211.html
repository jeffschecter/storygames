So, no GM. Just a bunch of players who get together to tell a story, based on a given setting.<br/><br/>That would be HEAVEN.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, all the players would have to agree most of (or all) the time, or else it wouldn't get past the first scene...</blockquote>\nBut cj.23 who started the thread came up with an actually useful set of definitions:<br/><br/><i>"Freeform can mean<br/>1) a particular style of 'one off' live action game with no physical combat, but often with rules, very often run at conventions. (See uK Freeforms list, and say CJ sent you!)<br/><br/>2) a rules light or systemless tabletop rpg where the story evolves from the group without much recourse to dice. Often was synonymous in the 80's with diceless or systemless tabletop rpg.<br/><br/>3) a PBEM often fanfic style narrative rpg game."</i><br/><br/>So is it just the lack of dice that makes something free form? <br/><br/>I ask because I had an argument with Jonathan Walton the other day about whether a game I am working on counted as freeform. The game is set in Iraq and deals with those who have died due to the war. Each player is issued beads to use to enter a scene to narrate how some faction, such as the US military, the press, insurgents, affects the life of a person involved in the war or living in Iraq.  When a person uses the last bead in a scene, the character who is being focused on will die in the next scene. <br/><br/>His point was that since there was a currency mechanic that determined when a character dies, it is not freeform. For me, I saw the beads as a simple pacing mechanic. A way of creating a loose structure for allowing people to introduce elements into the story, rather than simply making one person the antagonist of another, as in Shock: or Polaris. <br/><br/>But that raises another question, Polaris is not freeform. But not because of a lack of dice--they are used only as a last resort. But why? Or is it freeform? Where is the line? <br/><br/>best,<br/>Emily                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94333/#Comment_94333" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T08:42:57+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  8:42AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2007 9:17AM by timfire.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do you want a practical or theoretical response?

For number 2, however, I always put it that freeform has no "mechanics." Where "mechanics" is further defined as "an algorithm by which certain input is put through a hard-coded process that produces certain end effects." <br/>\n<br/>\nAll "dice mechanics" are a subset of mechanics. But so are Amber's "Diceless" mechanics such as the rule for adjudicating who wins a contest. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, to avoid confusion, note that most or all RPG mechanics have in their implementation some player judgment at some point - often in terms of when to use the mechanics, for instance. This "squishiness" in a mechanic doesn't prevent it from being a mechanic. The rule in Everway about interpreting a card is a mechanic, even if there is a participant who is adding a lot of input. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is to say that a RPG is only "Freeform" if there are no such methods - where the "rules" are that the participants use judgement alone to decide how the narrative proceeds. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs that rigorous?<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94346/#Comment_94346" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T09:36:07+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  9:36AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2007 9:37AM by J_Walton.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great topic, Em.  I just worry that the responses are going to be all over the place.<br/><br/>A few suggestions:<br/><br/>"Freeform" doesn't really have an established definition, more like a general understanding (see also: "roleplaying").<br/><br/>Dividing things into "freeform" and "non-freeform" is not very helpful once you start really getting into the details of things, especially if you're ultimately trying to get at the kind of stuff that you and I have been talking about.  There are lots of games, like <i>Polaris</i>, that use a mixture of techniques.  And there are many things that lie somewhere in between the "freeform" and "non-freeform" continuum.  Take <i>Once Upon a Time</i>, which has fortune all over the place with the card-drawing, has a fair bit of structure, but is also feels largely "freeform."<br/><br/>Things I like to think about in terms of freeform:<ol><li>Are their fortune mechanics (dice, cards, other random things) involved?</li><li>Are their resource distribution mechanics involved?</li><li>Does the game require players to make other strategic decisions (using the right skills/feats, choosing the right maneuver) in order to achieve what they want in the narrative?</li></ol>All of these feel, to me, like things that pull games towards "non-freeform" for me, though the amount of strategic thinking, resource management, randomness involved matters a lot.<br/><br/>On the other hand:<ol><li>Does the game require players to consider things in terms of appropriateness to the narrative?</li><li>Do players negotiate outcomes instead of maneuvering strategically to achieve them?</li><li>Is there a focus on building consensus?</li></ol>These things feel more "freeform" to me, even if there are loads of mechanics.  Again, of course, the amount of this, relative to the strategic stuff, matters.<br/><br/>Finally, Tim says <i>Polaris</i> isn't freeform because there are loads of mechanics, but most freeform games I know also have loads of mechanics, mostly in the form of  unwritten social rules that people are socialized to follow during initiation and over the course of play.  Some groups even <a href="http://www.worldweavers.net/rules.html" rel="nofollow">write these rules down</a> (those are the basic rules for World Weavers, who I created the website for).  I don't think that stops them from being freeform.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94347/#Comment_94347" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T09:42:47+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  9:42AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (In a recent thread about freeform on Knife Fight, "What's your reaction to the word 'Freeform'", I ended up with the understanding that "freeform" carries with it so many negative connotations that I don't really want to use it online anymore.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94348/#Comment_94348" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T09:43:30+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  9:43AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm.

Matthijs the KF thread you mentioned is an excellent illlustration of why. <br><br>It seems like there are several definitions of the word, even beyond what cj described:<br/><br/>First and foremost, the <i>activity</i> of freeform, which as Jason points out, is the thing that all of the uses point towards. Pure drama play as Christian describes it, free of all structures (except, perhaps, the underlying structure of the social dynamics of the people involved, their shared understanding of characters and story, cultural context etc.) Purely social level support for the play. <br/><br/>Then we have the various <i>types</i> of freeform game play: rules lite table top, structured but combat or mechanics free live action play, narrative chat and play by email, also journal and forum play, etc.  The Austrialian, Jeeps and others have strongly associated freeform with their styles of play. <br/><br/>The key thing for me, I found, when I was thinking about it was what Mark said--the lack of resolution mechanics. This may be why dicelessness seems to intrinsically bound up with what people think of as freeform.  Dice are almost universally used to resolve issues of difference of what will be established as having happened in play.  Drama as a resolution system means no dice.  <br/><br/>If we start looking at it as a continuum, as Jonathan does, and use some of those or other criteria, could we come up with some better, more precise terms to use? <br/><br/>For example, "structured freeform" is a term I picked up from JW. In my mind it means play using guidelines, structures for initiating play and ordering narration or interactions but is lacking resolution mechanics.  Are there terms that address the different issues in live and written play?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94365/#Comment_94365" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T10:38:39+00:00" title="September 10, 2007 10:38AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another component is the question of whether procedures are <i>consistent</i>. You can have a very procedure-heavy play environment, but the procedures may always or often be improvised on the fly. The consistent thing is an attitude toward procedure: it is an unpleasant necessity to be avoided, and the particulars of HOW an output is created is less important than the <i>fact</i> that an output is created. Freeform tends to invoke procedural methods to break out of dead-ends (resolve blocking? provide prompts?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94366/#Comment_94366" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T10:42:27+00:00" title="September 10, 2007 10:42AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2007 10:45AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm. I think that it really does make sense to categorize "Tabletop Freeform" from "LARP Freeform." That is, what the LARPers mean by Freeform is distinctly different than what tabletop players mean when they use the term freeform. They have similar meanings, sure. But each group connotes different things in the use of the term. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo whit, "Freeform" in the LARP sense is pretty well defined. If there's no stark line, there's at least an intuitive notion of what a LARP Freeform is, given all of the games that use the term as a label for a certain style of play. As opposed to the tabletop (and online) community which uses it pretty vaguely, if at all, to mean "light" or "having no dice" or "having no mechanics in the system" or "play during which no mechanics are employed" or whatever. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo be clear, my proposition is that the use of freeform as a notion makes the most sense to me as a useful term when it refers to mechanic-less play as I've defined it. Because this can be used alongside, or instead of "Light" or "diceless" etc, all of which already carve out the other distinctions well. So one would say, "Beyond just light or diceless, the game is freeform." <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, there will be grey areas, sure. And to that extent, saying, "This game is very freeform, with only one mechanic used in rare circumstances" might work. But I think that still indicates that freeform is the end of that spectrum that goes from freeform to "Zoggin lot's and lot's of mechanics and crunch." <br/>\n<br/>\nIf looking for a useful definition is not what you're looking for Em', then let me ask... why is it you ask the question? If you can answer that, we can probably give you better answers. I mean we can discuss what people mean when they use the term, or a good definition to use with the term locally for better understanding, or... well what's your need? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94371/#Comment_94371" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T10:53:10+00:00" title="September 10, 2007 10:53AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that "freeform" is a giant can of worms - monstrous.

Although the term is used extensively, it's poorly defined, and continues to be used to refer to a broad spectrum of activities.  I don't feel equipped to apply it to the online gaming--that is a huge area that needs attention. But live and table-top play are much closer to my experience, and likely we've got the knowledge among those participating here to get some clarity. <br/><br/>The other part, for me, is that it's the area of design I'm interested in forwarding. Both by writing games using these techniques, and talking more about the ones people are already using.  We've got a good body of theory about more formally structured games, and a great deal of analysis has been done about live play in the nordic scene. But it seems like we're still missing a systematic analysis of this part of it. <br/><br/>We don't have to accomplish that in this thread, but getting more terminology and specifics might be a good start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94380/#Comment_94380" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T11:16:56+00:00" title="September 10, 2007 11:16AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I play with a lot of people who all seem to have different ideas of what freeform is.

So, like, players could create "Alapraxian Necromancy" by making a set of guidelines for how spells in that school were performed and how they would be described in play ("always involve a crystal knife," "involve the sacred numbers 2 &amp; 6," "spells in the Alapraxian Wyrmtongue branch summon worms that feed on the dead," "the target of the spell is randomly chosen by the player sitting to the left of the caster," etc.).  Consequently, everything would end up very ideosyncratic and self-reflective, like something Shreyas or Rebecca Borgstrom wrote, because it would use a consistent set of images, descriptors, and guidelines.

Not unlike the term roleplaying, in general.<br/><br/>I'd think that freeform could be about lack of structures (no pre-determined archs of drama, not set turn order) and lack of abstractions (no stats, no social combat. no resource mechanics, etc). The "negotiate, negotiate, negotiate" sounds like a good criteria; something happens, the outcome is decided by players through negotiation (either by just negotiating between themselves, or negotiating in fiction via their characters, and with or without GM input).<br/><br/>The tricky thing with structures is that they usually are there, if hidden. There might be a basic plotline installed by the GM, or a whole lot of frontloading (characters, starting situtation) and where as the play itself is "freeform", there is some kind of guiding force. Freeform without some kind of structures is a kind of puzzling thought.<br/><br/>(Incidentally, Emily, I'd consider Jeepform very much being non-freeform, because there's plenty of structures there.)<br/><br/>Not sure about separating tabletop and live-action freeform from each other, either. What's the big difference? The act of negotiation is basically similar, even if in live-action it's quite often and only negotiation within the fiction, through the characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94451">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94451/#Comment_94451" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T14:50:09+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  2:50PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2007 2:55PM by jzn.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Freeform: "negotiate or if you want, use the rules"</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Alvin Frewer</cite><br/>Freeform: "Negotiate, negotiate, negotiate."</blockquote>\nJenskot's is closer to what I think of as a freeform rpg play.

No dice rollers, no official rules. You take on the nick of a character, make a send into a room, other people react to you, and there you go. Roleplaying without rules and mechanics. So there was no way to "go to the rules" if you came to an impasse.<br/><br/>Of course, rules do develop. People usually claim complete ownership over their characters, meaning that if you make a send stating that you shoot at me, I determine if and how you hit me. But then comes the social maneuvering: if you don't get hit often enough, people call you names and stop playing with you. If you randomly attack people, you get put on ignore. And so on. But these social rules are in flux, never written down. People with a competitive edge in this environment where you can't directly hurt another character quickly figure out that you need to manipulate these social rules to your advantage, and that's how you "win" in the end. That often turns ugly.<br/><br/>Anyway. Point is, there's freeform play without any mechanics and without consistent rules. That's my background in that regard, and that's why, when someone says "freeform," that's what I think of. I understand that that gives me a different perspective than people who started playing Ars Magicka and over time just stopped using the mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Faerieloch" title="Faerieloch"><img alt="Faerieloch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Faerieloch">Faerieloch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94461/#Comment_94461" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T15:06:46+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  3:06PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, a big distinction is that in "freeform", it's never a question of <i>whether</i> you succeed, but <i>how</i>.

The crux of the definition is that when you reach an impasse in negotiation, you go to the system.  If not for that aspect, the freeform distinction would be much cleaner than it is turning out to be.<br/><br/>I hear you. But to me, if there's a system, it's not freeform.  I think the real crux is - why doesn't negotiation work?  I've played with friends where negotiation always worked, and there really was no system, not even a plan for one. I've played with strangers on IRC where there was no system, but negotation didn't work, so it was often a mess, except when I could find people who I could negotiate with.<br/><br/>I think of it like freeform drawing or freeform dance.  The only thing you have is the medium.  A pencil on paper or moving to a certain piece of music.  Freeform roleplaying is similar, in that all you have is the medium - dialog with the other participants.  Like a lead or a follow in dance, you can have your roles (GM and players, player controlled characters, third person narratives, whatever), but the steps you take are all in the moment.<br/><br/>And if you get to that "third stage" negotiation and no one can go "okay, I give" or turn it over to a player not in the dispute to decide, then you might have no choice but to stop playing freeform.  Whether that's because you agree to disagree and stop playing, or because you add in a system to resolve the impasse.<br/><br/>Not that it should be surprising. Going without rules only works under the right conditions. Unless everyone is on the same page, and can set aside egos to always say "yes, and" to the ideas of their fellow players (or trust them when they say "yes, but" or "no, but"), eventually, something undesirable will come up, and having a rule to avoid that is helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad" title="Tobias Wrigstad"><img alt="Tobias Wrigstad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tobias%20Wrigstad">Tobias Wrigstad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94495/#Comment_94495" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-10T17:43:36+00:00" title="September 10, 2007  5:43PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>[Apologies if this post comes across as too offensive. I'm quite<br/>\njetlagged and maybe not on my best side.]</p>\n<p>For me, free form is about being free to make up the<br/>\nrules/mechanics/guidelines (=form) that will help you tell the<br/>\nstory at hand. Initially, I thought of freeform as rule-less<br/>\nroleplaying, but I quickly realised that it was (much) about<br/>\neliminating dice rolls or other arbitrary resolution mechanisms<br/>\nthat stood in the way of story telling (= not just simulating the<br/>\noutcome of what happens when five knights take on a mission.)</p>\n<p>As our stories grew up (we killed off the idea of the party, and<br/>\nthat of the quest, and moved them to places we could relate to),<br/>\nresolution mechanics weren't needed anymore because that wasn't<br/>\nwhat the games were about. And if talking your friend out of<br/>\njumping from the bridge requires dice roll, it isn't role-playing<br/>\nanymore. Story concensus decides. Which is done implicitly by all<br/>\nplayers and GM all the time.</p>\n<p>As we learned more fancy words, I think we (we being some Jeeps)<br/>\nrealised that freeform had a lot to do with conveying a message or<br/>\nhaving a premise. And that freeform was about helping you get that<br/>\nacross, or "protecting the premise". And free was about being free<br/>\nto use whatever (shady) methods you needed to do so. Tailor the<br/>\nform to the story. Make sure that the game's drama was the one you<br/>\nwanted.</p>\n<p>If a game is about how love is fickle, then it (can) make a lot of<br/>\nsense to roll dice for falling in and out of love. If a game is<br/>\nabout how little time we have for ourselves in our daily lives,<br/>\nthen a time token system (although I would personally have<br/>\npreferred a more organic approach, and an egg-timer) makes sense.</p>\n<p>I love the example of turning back to Rivendell because you didn't<br/>\nbring enough rope. 99 times out of 100 that sucks in a bad way.<br/>\nBut there will be a game where this is the essence at some point,<br/>\nand then equipment lists and having to buy equipment for money is<br/>\nall going to make sense to me again. A game about how pointless<br/>\nfigting is in roleplaying games should adopt the Role Master rules<br/>\nimmediately to achieve the right meta-play effects.</p>\n<p>IMO, freeform games are far from rule-less although I think that<br/>\nthey seldom use traditional table-top rules, like resolution<br/>\nsystems, etc. Naturally there are obvious social conventions which<br/>\nare developed in every freeform community, but also game-specific<br/>\nrules. An implicitly understood game-specific rule from an old<br/>\ngame is this:</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>This scene is about being miserable; it is only okay to add good<br/>\n  things to the game if they are immediately lost.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Is Diplomacy freeform? Not necessarily, but I think it can be<br/>\nplayed as such. Any game, even Vampire, can be played freeform<br/>\nstyle if you start by throwing the books away and keeping only the<br/>\nstuff you've internalised that is not going to be an obstacle to<br/>\nyour play. The game's form can greatly be supported by resolution<br/>\nmechanics if they add to what the game is about.</p>\n<p>I like what Mathijs said: "No numbers. No resource management.<br/>\nMinimum amount of bothersome mechanics." I'd like to add just as<br/>\nmuch numbers, resource management and mechanics as is needed to<br/>\nconvey my message or keep the game focussed on the premise.</p>\n<p>Faerieloch said "that in 'freeform', it's never a question of whether you succeed, but how."</p>\n<p>I think that is true, but that should also be true for any good<br/>\nsystem in a roleplaying game (as opposed to task-resolving games<br/>\nor simulations). A lot of people have misread this as "in<br/>\nfreeform, you always succeed", but it should really be read as,<br/>\n"things might not go as you like only when there is a good point<br/>\n(story-wise or meta-play-wise) for them not to. Then anything<br/>\nmight happen."</p>\n<p>In my experience, Alvin Frewer is right that "the players figure<br/>\nout where things go", because that is the smoothest and most<br/>\nunobtrusive way of playing.

Even though they can't possibly win, the Good Guys struggling to bring into being the world they envision!  There needs to be conflict, in my mind, for a good story to take shape and therefore "freeform" in story games needs to have some way of resolving these conflicts (even if it's just the players discussing it back and forth with no written mechanics).

Then we'd narrate the result, and carry on. Often we used a good deal of GM fiat, for speed and other reasons, but I don't think that was really necessary.<br/><br/>Is this freeform?

Someone else has said this better than I can:\n<blockquote>"Modernist manuals of writing often conflate story with conflict. This reductionism reflects a culture that inflates aggression and competition while cultivating ignorance of other behavioral options."<br/>  -- Ursula Le Guin, "Steering the Craft" </blockquote>\nI fear this might be dragging us away from the real thrust of this thread, so I'll probably spin it off as a separate one.  On the other hand, it does have bearing on the subject of freeform gaming and what it might be, at least in my opinion.<br/><br/>To clarify, as prompted by komradebob's excellent question, I'm trying to talk about 'conflict' in the sense of 'conflicting opinions between players as to what is happening or what should happen in the Shared Imagined Space' if that's not too jargony.  I don't mean Bob the PC blowing away the nameless mook.<br/><br/>With respect to freeform, I think it has to have a freedom from these conflicting opinions.  As soon as there's a need to resolve any conflicting opinions, then you have System.  I'm including negotiation in this.

If you're just gong "eh, we felt like introducing a random element" that's not making it less freeform, unless you've gotten to the point where you say "randomness exists HERE, and HERE are the results, etc. etc."<br/><br/>There seems to be a weird argument out there floating around that freeform is somehow free of System. Where did this come from and why is it being discussed? It's not - it's simply free of <i>mechanic</i>. The definition in my head for freeform is <i>System without mechanics</i>. It's playing without a "net." Once you have mechanics - something to fall back on besides negotiation, you are not playing freeform anymore - you have yourself a net.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94639/#Comment_94639" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T08:01:25+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  8:01AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2007 8:01AM by JDCorley.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nothin' wrong with the Grapes of Wrath....<br/><br/>Anyway, the idea that freeform is "conflictless" is not true by definition although it often is in practice.

His suggestion is that I find her hot, and it becomes my job to reinforce that fact.

Once you have mechanics - something to fall back on besides negotiation, you are not playing freeform anymore - you have yourself a net.</blockquote>\nThis nails it,in my book.  Open and shut. This is "pure" freeform. Quite possibly only a hypothetical concept. <br/><br/>So what we're looking at in other types of "freeform" is games where people have adopted types of rules that guide play but that aren't quite "mechanics". This encompasses drama as resolution, the asystematic system. Narrative online games often use the "your authority ends at my nose" guideline to moderate conflict. Adversity can be offered, but it must be accepted. This is an example of a freeform system where they do *not* use the "Always say yes". Any player gets to say "no" to harm to their character, but i believe, as Christian talked about in his freeform experience, there is strong social pressure put to bear. Social structure as system (pretty much sucks imo, but that's a different story).  The stricture in jeep is "what happens, goes" (and yes, Jukka, jeep form is highly structured, there are very strong secure nets there).  <br/><br/>Then we have the consistency.  Tobias and Dave Hallet talked about good reasons for including mechanics, to reinforce and emulate the experience the players were looking for in their story or themes of play, and to support story. (I've got a bone to pick with you Tobias, about mechanics neceesarily being bad for that, but for another time).  In our Griffin's Aerie game, we did the same thing. When we faced down a dragon, we created special dragon dice rules that helped us provide our selves with meaningful adversity, while adding interesting complexity to the events: the dragon had poisonous breath and emotion warping effects. Along with straight up narration of the corruption and destruction it spread in its wake, we also used the dice to see who got hurt or emotionally effected by the proximity of the dragon to help us inflict damage that would help us make better story, without flinching at taking the hit on a character we played, or choosing via a contrived strategy.  <br/><br/>Then guidelines vs. mechanics.  That's where the real continuum is, I think, that is of interest to me. What are the structures and guidelines that work? What have people done? What structures can be used across forms, what are most suited to one or the other? What are the unique concerns of live vs. tabletop? Do the tehcniques map, or must they be distinct? Why is it that you can use drama as a resolution system? And is that even true or are there other rules hidden in each application of that which we can find through observation? <br/><br/>So, Jzn, there lies my agenda.  We've really done a great job of nailing how to write mechanical games. We're at the point now where we can really start honing the craft and applying the lessons to make amazing structures. The theory bed is laid and the craft mastering can begin.  But there is a whole world of other play that we haven't done that with yet.  Freeform is a borderland between straight up mechanical (table top) play and others (live forms, online narrative play, improv).  So, working here will help, I think, get clearer about what's happening in those forms.

The CHARACTERS can get involved in conflicts with other characters. So if conflict is essential to story, that's where the conflict comes from.<br/><br/>For example, consider playing "by oneself" - sitting around writing a story, or telling an audience a story on the spot. Isn't this a kind of freeform? Then think of two storytellers, alternating paragraphs, taking whatever the last said as given. I'd say that's freeform too. It's a kind of harmony among the people telling the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
