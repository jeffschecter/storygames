You could close your eyes and count prayer beads until you reached the end of a sutra and then look at whatever bead was currently in between your fingers.  Bingo, Buddhist randomizer!  Also, the craft party where everyone made their string of beads sounds really fun, like making an actual coat for your<i>Dogs</i>character.</blockquote>\nI was hesitant to approach this idea since I consider necklace-based resolution damn near synonymous with Kynn Bartlett's <a href="http://kynn.livejournal.com/723814.html" rel="nofollow">Bone White, Blood Red</a>. I couldn't let the idea slide though, even if I don't use it for Do. Using a necklace as the sole randomizer is just plain <i>neat</i>.<br/><br/>Okay. Let's say you have a necklace of beads in three different colors. The colors each represent different aspects of your character. The pattern in which you thread the beads represent your focus on those aspects. Continuous sets of a single color represent a special focus on what that color represents. Mixed, alternating colors represent a broader sweep.<br/><br/>Actions/Conflicts/Stuff are resolved in a manner similar to the <a href="http://gobi.livejournal.com/622575.html" rel="nofollow">Fudge+ORE+ORX mashup</a>. There are three possible results. You're looking for large sets of matching results. The system assumes success, using a randomizer to determine the <i>type</i> and <i>degree</i> of success according to a slightly modified Fate description ladder:<br/><br/>7 \tLegendary<br/>6 \tEpic<br/>5 \tSuperb<br/>4 \tGreat<br/>3 \tGood<br/>2 \tFair<br/>1 \tAverage<br/><br/>When you need to resolve an action, close your eyes and pass the necklace through your hands a few times. Pinch one bead between your thumb and forefinger. Open your eyes.<br/><br/>The color of the bead represents the "color" of your success. If the bead is part of a set of identically colored beads, the length of that string corresponds to a number of steps up the description ladder. <br/><br/>So let's say you're playing a standard D&amp;D fantasy. The colors represent Might (Red), Stealth (Black) and Magic (White). Your necklace has twenty beads in the following order:<br/><br/><b><span style="color: #FF0000;">R</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">B</span><span style="color: #FF0000;">R</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">B</span><span style="color: #CCCCCC;">WWWW</span><span style="color: #FF0000;">RRR</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">B</span><span style="color: #FF0000;">R</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">B</span><span style="color: #CCCCCC;">W</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">BBBBB</span></b><br/><br/>You come across a horde of orcs lookin' to kick your ass. Defend yourself!<br/><br/>You close your eyes, pass the necklace through your hands and land on a white bead. That means you've tried to use magic to defend yourself, but how successful were you?  It just so happens that you've landed in the middle of a string of four white beads, which means you achieved a great magical success!<br/><br/>Other ideas, not necessarily connected to one another:\n<ul>\n<li>A numbered stat that tells you how many steps you can take to the left or right on your necklace to adjust the outcome. Say you landed on a single white bead, but you're two steps away from a big-ass string of five blue beads. If you had a relevant stat at rank 2, you could move your fingers two steps along the necklace and land on that blue set.</li>\n<li>A numbered stat that limits the size of a set. If you've got For King and Country! at rank 6, that means you can include six beads of your necklace. If this spans two or three colors of beads, each set can be used for separate actions.</li>\n<li>Like Jonathan suggests, you might have to recite a mantra while passing the necklace through your hands. The mantra might <i>be</i> a stat, with the number of words taking the place of a purely abstract rank. This might make the compulsion to count the beads (as they pass blindly through your hand) a feature rather than a bug.</li>\n<li>You might re-arrange your necklace before each session.</li>\n<li>The necklace could be merged into Jared Sorensen's <a href="http://www.memento-mori.com/other/games/colorwheel.html" rel="nofollow">color wheel</a> system without much fuss at all.</li>\n</ul>\nAnother interesting feature of necklaces is that they're not seamlessly cyclical. There's always a little knot or hook in the back where the necklaces closes to form a loop. This could be something that is easily discerned in the hand as a point of reference.<br/><br/>Kynn, I haven't been keeping track of BWBR's progress the past few months, so I apologize if any of this is a total ripoff of your present version of the game. ^_^<br/><br/>Anyhoo... Yeah! Let's play with necklaces! What cool stuff can be done with them?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103348/#Comment_103348" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-16T19:21:32+00:00" title="October 16, 2007  7:21PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 16, 2007 7:24PM by MikeRM.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These are ideas of stunning excellence.

I'm skeptical about it's utility as a randomizer, but what if it's not a randomizer at all.<br/><br/>The neckalce has a number of beads of different shapes or colors arranged in a simple repeating pattern of ABCD. Each bead form represents a single magical syllable. These can be strung together to make something (say, for example, magic spells).<br/><br/>The player rolls a number of D4. Let's say it's 6d4. Each round, each player chooses a die and moves that many steps on the necklace, adding that syllable to their current spell. Choices are simultaneous. The die is then discarded. Every time they complete a string of syllables that represents a spell is completed, the spell goes off.<br/><br/>Imagine the spell list looks something like this:<br/><br/>ABC = fireblast (does damage, negates iceblast)<br/>CBA = iceblast (does damage, negates fireblast)<br/>AD = shield (stops a spell)<br/>BB = reflect (sends spell back on its caster)<br/>BA = heal 1 point<br/>DD = re-roll a die<br/>B = do  1 damage to opponent<br/><br/>and so on...<br/><br/>As players use up their dice, it reduces their choices. Players need to build powerful spells, while guessing which die their opponent will use next.<br/><br/>This it totally adapted from Richard Bartle's Spellbinder (<a href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/spellbnd.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/spellbnd.htm</a>), so no particualr credit to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103578/#Comment_103578" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T05:28:30+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  5:28AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a totally different kind of necklace: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khipu" rel="nofollow">Quipu</a><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/Inca_Quipu.jpg"/><br/><br/>"Quipu or khipu were recording devices used in the Inca Empire and its predecessor societies in the Andean region.

Were you imagining any inherent value in a longer sutra compared to a shorter sutra? I could see some value if you're going for precision in your, um, roll<sup>1</sup>.<br/><br/>For example, say you begin a session at the clasp of your necklace. When you do something, you recite a sutra, moving one bead for each word, and the color of the bead you land on has some in-game effect, like a bonus to the stat represented by that color.<br/><br/>For your next sutra, you begin at the bead you landed on in your previous sutra. In this way, the pattern of the beads is kind of a pacing mechanic for the whole session. There may be some endgame condition predicated on the number of times you go around your necklace.<br/><br/>A shorter sutra gives you more precise outcomes, while a longer sutra expedites the cycle around the necklace.<br/><sup><br/>1</sup> <sub>(There ought to be an equivalent word for "roll" when using a necklace.)</sub> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104038/#Comment_104038" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-21T12:24:32+00:00" title="October 21, 2007 12:24PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>A shorter sutra gives you more precise outcomes, while a longer sutra expedites the cycle around the necklace.</blockquote>\nYeah, you could totally go with that, if you wanted to have strategic meaning in the sutras.  That seems less meditative then, if players need to be worry about what trait to use and are counting ahead on their prayer beads to figure out how far away they were from the result they want.  Personally, I really despise having to worry about things like that in a game that's about problem solving more than combat, since there are already puzzles in the situation of the game and I don't really feel like I need more in the mechanics, but that's just me.<br/><br/>Also, reversing the direction you are counting could be important.  And you could have one or more special beads that trigger neat things if you land on them, like the Bankruptcy or ONE MILLION $$$ spaces on Wheel of Fortune.  I mean, a chain of beads is basically a spinner that you count on, so looking at Candyland and Wheel of Fortune and other spinner games might be a good thing.<br/><br/>I was thinking more that, to ensure a truly random result that would be hard to predict, you'd want sutras to have a number of words in them that was hard to mentally apply to the beads to know in advance what you'd get.  So if there's 20 beads, you could have sutras of 13 words or 31 words, which would make it harder to just glance at your beads and figure out the result without practice.<br/><br/>Or, perhaps it would be better to have a variable number of words.  You could declare your action as a sutra, counting off words as you go and then check the result once you got there, instead of having to wait to roll and check the result.  If that worked, you could just keep narrating constantly, checking for results every so often by glancing down.<br/><br/><b>Example:</b> <br/><br/>Daniel is playing Ryoshi and is counting beads for every word he speaks.  The GM is doing likewise, playing Tondo, a pirate queen.  Perhaps the GM's made up a set of beads for every major NPC or faction, or maybe the GM has one set of beads that she always uses.<br/><br/>DAN: "I wish you would come to your senses and stop kidnapping the children of this world."<br/><br/>GM: "Ha!  What do you know of the ways of this world?  You are but a monk who comes from far away!"<br/><br/>BOTH sides check / compare the beads they landed on.  The GM has the edge, so she declares next...<br/><br/>GM: "Seize him!  Tie his hands and drag him below to the brig!"<br/><br/>DAN: I slip between the legs of one of the pirates, deftly avoiding his grasp and attempt to knock the other one down with a leg sweep.<br/><br/>BOTH sides check / compare the beads they landed on.  A tie!  The GM retains control...<br/><br/>GM: The second pirate is not so easily toppled.  He grabs your long dangling sleeve and throws you towards the waiting hands of the queen's bodyguard.<br/><br/>DAN: I shout for my comrades who are sitting on a nearby cloud, waiting for my signal.  "Help!  Abe!  Lucian!"<br/><br/>BOTH sides check / compare the beads they landed on.  DAN gains the upper hand!<br/><br/>DAN: My shouts echo up to them.  (OOC) You guys are going to come save me right?<br/><br/>EMILY (playing Abe and starting to count her beads as she speaks): Abe drops like a stone and lands on the pirate queen's bodyguard.<br/><br/>TONY (playing Lucian, counting his beads): Lucian shrugs before dropping through the cloud and causing it to empty it's load of water on the pirates, soaking them all and making Ryoshi more slippery to hold onto.<br/><br/>THEY ALL compare their beads.  Unsurprisingly, with 3 against 1, the monks retain the advantage against the GM's characters.<br/><br/><b>/Example</b><br/><br/>There are more complex and interesting things you could do there, depending on how you want the different colors of beads to interact with each other and how you want group-based conflicts to work, but there's one idea.<br/><br/>Another idea would be to deal with tasks like picking a lock or whatever.  You could describe what you are doing, check the result, see if it worked or not, and then continue to describe what you are doing next based on the result.  So you could have a scene where one character describes the various steps of sneaking into the pirate queen's secret base, checking their beads every so often and narrating success or failures or guards coming all on their own, without the GM needed to step in and describe those things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104040/#Comment_104040" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-21T12:44:01+00:00" title="October 21, 2007 12:44PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think, for "roll" you want "count."<br/><br/>BTW, both of the Buddhist prayer bead strings that I have have 108 beads (I just counted them).

That led me to the Chinese version of Rock-Paper-Scissors, <b>Staff-Tiger-Chicken-Insect</b> (<i>bangzi laohu ji chongzi</i>), which has four different signs and often has inconclusive results (for example, Tiger vs. Insect) which require the participants to try again.  That would lead to even more "ties," which may or may not be what you want, but would be worth playtesting.<br/><br/>So then I was thinking about how Staff-Tiger-Chicken-Insect could relate to your pseudo-Buddhist flavor, perhaps representing the various stages of terrestrial incarnation.  The Staff clearly represents Humans, who are eaten (when dead) by Insects, who are eaten by Chickens / Birds, who are eaten by Tigers / "Running Beasts" (<i>zou shou</i>), who are eaten and beaten off by Humans.  So then I looked up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_realms" rel="nofollow">Six Realms of reincarnation in Buddhism</a>, which, coincidentally enough, are mapped to various colors and to various syllables of the mantra <b>Om mani padme hum</b>.\n<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"><tr valign="top"><th>Syllable</th><th>Six Paramitas</th><th>Purifies</th><th>Samsaric realm</th><th>Colors</th><th>Symbol of the Deity</th></tr><tr valign="top"><th>Om</th><td>Meditation / Bliss</td><td>Pride</td><td>Devas</td><td>White</td><td>Wisdom</td></tr><tr valign="top"><th>Ma</th><td>Patience</td><td>Jealousy / Lust for entertainment</td><td>Asuras</td><td>Green</td><td>Compassion</td></tr><tr valign="top"><th>Ni</th><td>Discipline</td><td>Passion / desire</td><td>Humans</td><td>Yellow</td><td>Body, speech, mind<br/>quality and activity</td></tr><tr valign="top"><th>Pad</th><td>Wisdom</td><td>Stupidity / prejudice</td><td>Animals</td><td>Blue</td><td>Equanimity</td></tr><tr valign="top"><th>Me</th><td>Generosity</td><td>Poverty / possessiveness</td><td>Pretas (hungry ghosts)</td><td>Red</td><td>Bliss</td></tr><tr valign="top"><th>Hum</th><td>Diligence</td><td>Aggression / hatred</td><td>Naraka</td><td>Black</td><td>Quality of Compassion</td></tr></table>\nYou could use these like the word-ranking chart in Fudge, where getting a Green (Ma) result is always better than a Red (Me) result.  And this would solve Fred's issue of wanting one-syllable sounds for referring to the various bead colors.  It wouldn't, however, give you any "ties" in the results, but that's not necessarily a problem.  It would potentially get you "degrees of success" based on how much higher up the six ranked realms the victor was from their opponent.  It would basically allow you to do all the things you would normally do with a 1d6 roll, actually.<br/><br/>Plus, there could conceivably be a way to do advancement in style or effectiveness by having the characters "refine" their beads by having them move up the realms, towards the White beads of the Devas, away from the Black beads of the Naraka.  This would make them more successful and, depending on the associations you assign to various bead types, might mean that they solve problems in different ways.  For example, it could be that, if you get a result above Ni (the level of Humanity) you cannot solve problems through violence.  So, then, refining your beads (or pushing them down the chart towards the demons) would also change the nature of a character's actions and their personality in general.<br/><br/>If you think six colors is too many, you could easily go with a five-color scheme based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer_flag" rel="nofollow">Tibetan Prayer Flags</a> (which could be a good substitute for strings of beads, since it might be easier to add or remove them from a string) or a four-color scheme based on the elements, since "The four elements air, fire, water and earth are also identified with four different colors: blue (or black), red, white and yellow."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104187/#Comment_104187" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T13:43:13+00:00" title="October 22, 2007  1:43PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You realize that counting round a string of beads is functionally the same as going round a Monopoly-style board, don't you?<br/><br/>Jonathan's mention of Bankruptcy made this click for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104190/#Comment_104190" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T13:56:09+00:00" title="October 22, 2007  1:56PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Functionally only if your "functionally" includes math and excludes psychological effects, which seems to be completely the wrong way to think, to me.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104199/#Comment_104199" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T15:30:49+00:00" title="October 22, 2007  3:30PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, spinners, loops of beads, a looped boardgame board, they are all similar in the way they operate.
