                    Iâ€™m making an Alternate History fantasy setting for the WIP, and Iâ€™m fishing for interesting ingredients. Iâ€™m not trying to nail down everything about the setting, because a part of play is for the players to create situations and â€œconnect the dots.â€ But I need enough skeleton and â€œpregnantâ€ situations for them to start off with. Anyhow, please look at what Iâ€™ve got and feel free to throw in any creative ideas that pop to mind.<br/>
<br/>
My starting point is ~1500 Europe, but with a few sources of real supernatural power to draw from, each operating quite differently from the others.<br/>
<br/>
Bit and pieces I'm working from:<br/>
<br/>
1) A transalpine region infested with various dark humanoids and unholy creatures. The Dark Ancient Underdwellers sustain these twisted beings, but compel them to hunger for lifeforce. Some humans have learned how to tap into this power source, albeit with side effects. The "civilized world" is much smaller and less certain than ours was.<br/>
<br/>
2) Individuals with a natural penchant for things scientific and/or mechanical can, with study and practice, harness and direct the flow of some amount of magical â€œanimus,â€ a force which can create mechanical motion and/or heat. I picture da Vinci building a series of amplifier lenses to power an ornithopter. I see the streets of Verona lined with magical lamps. I picture Johannes Gensfleisch (Gutenberg to us) inventing a flame-throwing weapon to help hold the walls of the Free City of Mainz.<br/>
<br/>
3) A monotheistic religion that was adopted by the old Roman Empire and persists as a major cultural force. Their God is a hands-off creator, and holds no sway over earthy matters. Call upon the right saint, however, and assistance may be granted to you.<br/>
<br/>
4) A Kalmar Union that stretches west to Britannia. Their pantheon is composed of a handful of Godlings who can lend real power to their followers.<br/>
<br/>
Iâ€™ve got lots of ideas for political/cultural tensions among most of the â€œcivilized world.â€ But I donâ€™t have strong ideas for anything over in the Mameluk/Ottoman region. Iâ€™d like some additional â€œpower sourceâ€ that fits that area and is quite different from the others.                </div>

                            Mark, one pregnant source is anachronistic science and philosophy.  If you're going back to 1500, you can discard germ theory, the periodic table, any understanding of sexual reproduction, the heliocentric solar system, and so on.  What's the world look like when it's <em>actually</em> flat, diseases don't come from microbes but the wrath of God, where the female is simply the vessel for the male's generative seed, and all material things are made up of the four elements?  Take a look at correspondence and association as the basis for thought, rather than causal relationships; that changes <em>everything</em>.  If "as above, so below" is the unifying axiom of the universe, what effect does that have?  And so on.                        </div>

                            Great topic! I have some notes for a rennaisance game I was working on. I wanted to capture the virulence of the Catholic - Protestant wars but to defuse the political touchiness of that topic. <br/><br/>I had a pagan religion that was the successor of the ancient Roman religion, but had become centralized, i.e. with a Pope, Carindals, monasteries, and the trappings of the Catholic faith. The pope receives authority to work magic from the gods and passes it down to the cardinals and so on down the line. They use this heirarchy to enforce obedience (but there are always factions, heretics, and rogue branches out there).<br/><br/>Then I had an emerging form of scientific magic or "natural philosophy". It's workings were a complex mix of alchemy, astrology, and science, but anyone could use it with the right training, knowledge, or experimentation. Of course the Church has done its best to outlaw and denounce it as demonic it as a potential threat to its foundation. The natural philosophers, of course, engage in their share of anti-Church agitating too.<br/><br/>The upshot is a setting riven by magical/political conflict, but where the characters don't necessarily have to take sides. You could be a rogue bishop working for Queen Victoria, the Pope's own astrologer, or anything in between.<br/><br/>And for good measure, here are two threads from a blog I write on about another magical rennaisance setting that might have some ideas:<br/><br/><a href="http://attacksofopportunity.blogspot.com/2002/12/mathematica.html" rel="nofollow">Mathematica</a><br/><a href="http://attacksofopportunity.blogspot.com/2005/11/mathematica-revisted.html" rel="nofollow">Mathematica Revised</a><br/><a href="http://attacksofopportunity.blogspot.com/2005/12/mathematica-and-fiction-of-history.html" rel="nofollow">Mathematica: the Fiction of History</a><br/><br/>The upshot was a setting riven by conflict and politics.                        </div>

                            Joshua:<br/>Fascinating idea! I had hit upon the idea of presenting a version of the Hereford mappa mundi as the world map, leaving it up to players whether there was more to the world than that (a quest to the antipodes, perhaps?) Your idea generaizes that to all of human knowledge at the time, which I think is quite cool and full of possibility.<br/><br/>Tony:<br/>Your description of the centralized religion makes me think I want two threads of power in the church in my world. One heirarchical like you describe, and one straight from the saints. Then there is yet another source of tension, as the church may well frown on the "hedge priests" in certain areas. Your natural philosophy sounds very similar to my ideas in the realm of the "animus" users, and tensions between them and the church is a good potential source of conflict.<br/><br/>Thanks to you both for the fruitful comments!                        </div>

                            "Hedge priests": this was about the period of the Friars (Franciscan and Dominican). Whatever their later integration into the hegemony, the early Franciscans in particular were a very discomforting group (like the Hebrew prophets) who were looked at very askance by the hierarchy and criticized it in no uncertain terms.<br/><br/>Later, of course, and not necessarily much later, friars (who wandered around loose without a lot of oversight sometimes) were notorious for their scandalous lives and preying upon the gullible. Which is pretty much what they were accused of, falsely, early on.<br/><br/>Something else for you to transform into the terms of your setting and play with if you wish.<br/><br/>EDIT: I beg your pardon, I managed to slip that by 300 years. By 1500 the Friars were long established and had fallen a long way from the radical piety of their foundation in the 13th century.                        </div>
