Different games have different (often implied) methodology for scene framing. Many of them assume that the GM has a scene-framing <i>duty</i> that is fulfilled in service of player character intent; the GM's job in a game like this is to frame towards interesting events, but not to skip over any important choices. In a game like this the players have veto (often left out of the written game text because it assumes that the GM is not pushing this authority in the first place), so the correct procedure is to back off and allow the player his input; scene framing here only exists for the purpose of skipping towards the next important scene, not as an active method of wielding power.<br/><br/>Often in a game like this you can get what you want (the player character in a compromising situation) by setting up a conflict of one sort or other in an earlier scene. Essentially you buy the right to compromise the character by establishing the character's inability to control himself. For example, if I want to have the player character wake up in a ditch in <i>Dust Devils</i>, I need to frame into the night before and request the player to run a conflict over his ability to keep from succumbing to his Devil, alcoholism. Obviously the player can give with no fuss if he doesn't have a problem with his character being a drunken sod, but the game's methodology requires me to give him a chance, so I'll have to establish the drunken binge in the game instead of just jumping ahead to the aftermath.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/czipeter" title="czipeter"><img alt="czipeter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/czipeter">czipeter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390379/#Comment_390379" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-16T00:08:11+00:00" title="September 16, 2012 12:08AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow!

I'm prone to take it personally and that's too bad. Right now, I'm mostly with Johnstone's first one. Something like this:<br/>(calm down, breath deeply)"Oh, you must have some strong feelings about this. Do you want to talk about it? Should we take a break? And if you're ready, we can continue with the game as well."<br/><br/>Making me re-do everything whenever they want, as many times they wish feels like crossing the Czege principle the same way as doing it for themselves (just slower). It setlles, peters out and becomes a bland table chatter of what should we do, instead of actually doing things.

Once they know you are not just trying to screw them over without giving them a chance to do something about it, they will probably be less hostile to you framing a scene in progress, and may be more interested in contributing to it.<br/><br/>For example:<br/>GM: So, you're out in the desert with Pete and Dillip. In Pete's car, I guess.<br/><br/>Player: WTF? No way, I would never go out into the desert with Pete and Dillip, are you kidding me?<br/><br/>GM: Okay, you say that now but let's say it did happen. What would get you to go out there, what could possibly lead you to be in that situation.<br/><br/>Player: I mean... a suitcase full of money, maybe? It would have to be pretty fucking important!<br/><br/>GM: Okay, cool.

If someone did this to me - sticking firmly to the rules, after I'd made it clear I was uncomfortable with something that had been narrated - I'd leave the table.<br/><br/>Czipeter, let me rephrase the situation that way. You had a woman at the table who wasn't used to storygames. You narrated something she <i>really</i> didn't like and she told you so. (And I'm still a bit uncomfortable with the idea she's been "conditioned" and that she "kicked over the table").<br/><br/>That's a red line. Slow down, find out what's happening. Perhaps she doesn't understand how the game works, perhaps you've pushed a button. Remember that, in circumstances like this, it can be difficult to express what you're uncomfortable with. Under no circumstances stick rigidly to the rules.<br/><br/>Most of the good games that include scene framing make this provision. They rarely say: you can frame <i>anything</i> you want, even if the other player really hates it. They say: if someone really doesn't like your scene framing, talk about it, work it out and continue.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390389/#Comment_390389" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-16T01:35:16+00:00" title="September 16, 2012  1:35AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2012 1:37AM by w176.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Wow! A lot of answers, I say! I feel you really care about me and her (and our gaming). Thank you.<br/><br/>You know, what really stopped me in my tracks is that I believe it could work without such a hassle. I could frame, and she could know that her turn will come as well. But I believe that as an all-time tradgamer, she is conditioned to believe that she has to fight for her character (or rather: participation) at each and every front she can perceive.<br/>I am okay with "that was a bad one", but kicking over the table feels just off-limits for me (that's why I used the word malaise)--it's a higher level of saying "No" than I can deal with. I'm prone to take it personally and that's too bad. Right now, I'm mostly with Johnstone's first one. Something like this:<br/>(calm down, breath deeply)"Oh, you must have some strong feelings about this. Do you want to talk about it? Should we take a break? And if you're ready, we can continue with the game as well."<br/><br/>Making me re-do everything whenever they want, as many times they wish feels like crossing the Czege principle the same way as doing it for themselves (just slower). It setlles, peters out and becomes a bland table chatter of what should we do, instead of actually doing things. I think not going down this road is the safest way.</blockquote>\nI think the easiest way to show her that it is not a traditional game, and she can relax and let her self be vulnerable is to give her very free reins. Be a fan of her character and say "Yes!" and show her she don't have to fight.  I writen a bit on how to help people chose a more vulnerable playstyle here. <a href="http://gamingaswomen.com/posts/2012/09/play-boldly-let-yourself-be-vulnerable/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://gamingaswomen.com/posts/2012/09/play-boldly-let-yourself-be-vulnerable/</a><br/><br/>If she think she has to fight and you also move into a protective stance blocking her protest, you will just confirm her fears and her impression that she got to fight.<br/><br/>Don't pause and ask this:<br/><i> "Oh, you must have some strong feelings about this. Do you want to talk about it? Should we take a break? And if you're ready, we can continue with the game as well."</i><br/><br/>Because that places a lot of blame on her when the blame could just as well be your for placing a bad scene. The question, and makes clear you see her speaking up as wrong and disapprove of it, instead of confirming that speaking up and communicating is a good thing when it is a problem. Asking her to tell the whole group why she might have an issue with the scene can also be problematic. If it is a sensitive subject expecting her to talk about it can be stomping on an old wound.<br/><br/>I would just say<br/><i><br/>"Oh. My bad. Lets change the scene so that you character faces challenge that fits you character better.

Seriously, that kind of agency-shattering "scene framing" is not part of any of the usual games people name-drop around here. You don't do it in Primetime Adventures, Mountain Witch, Shadow of Yesterday, Burning Wheel, Sorcerer, Dust Devils, Apocalypse World, Polaris [draws breath] Dungeons &amp; Dragons (well 4th edition you might, but still), or any but the most conceptual experimental proge designs that often for good reason are considered marginal. Games that utilize non-negotiable framing are often about powerless people to begin with; you might get something like this in My Life with Master, and even that game fails horribly if you don't have advance player buy-in for the fact that their character is beholden to a dysfunctional relationship.<br/><br/>If your scene framing means that the players have to constantly be accepting that you play their characters off-scene, then we're not talking about mere scene framing theory-wise, but rather of a curious form of joint character ownership. That could be appropriate for some horror game where player characters have fugue episodes and alternate personalities. If players are getting the feeling that you're putting their characters into situations that they have no buy-in for, then you're using scene framing as a power tool.<br/><br/>Now, I can get where a GM might come from and end up working like that. The game's point often is all about putting the characters into compromising positions and seeing what happens. It's seductively easy to come to the conclusion that your job is easiest to perform if the players don't get any say on what sorts of scenarios their characters end up in. However, the difference between a philosophical thought-exercise and a dramatic roleplaying game is in player buy-in, and you can't get that if you just tell the player that now he's gonna be playing a serial killer ("New scene, you've just murdered somebody, what do you do?") or whatever. You need to talk these sorts of things over with the players in one way or another, through game-play or explicitly in planning.<br/><br/>In practice hard scene framing is not about players meekly accepting whatever, but rather about careful groundwork and conditional statements. I can frame a character into a fight with his father because it has been established earlier that their relationship is problematic, for example. Or I can frame the character into a drug-abuse orgy (to pick a famous example from TSoY) because I offer the frame in a suggestive tone, waiting for the player to affirm that it accords with his character vision before proceeding. If a player has a complaint about a frame, then I need to back up and work with the player to establish his terms.<br/><br/>Scene framing is about recognizing the important fictional elements and going directly for them, not about putting player characters into spots they don't want to be in. Fluid scene framing can only grow among a group with trust: players can only let go of detailed fictional positioning when they truly believe that they're not going to lose the game because of it. For this reason, too, your scene framing needs to always be consensual; if players do not have choices about accepting your frames, then trust will never grow. There is no trust without freedom.<br/><br/>What this process looks like in practice is, you always give way when players have problems with your scene framing. Yes, you redo the frame as many times as necessary. And specifically, you talk about the fictional positioning of the player character as long as the player needs to feel comfortable. Say that I wanted to frame a murder attempt on a character while he's in the middle of a shopping mall. "You're doing your shopping at the mall when..." I start, but the player interrupts. OK, doesn't your character ever go to the mall? Doesn't need to be the next day, could be a week from now. OK, let's say not the mall then, but he does get out of the house at some point? Would a movie theater be OK? Surely he doesn't just sit home all day watching the door? We've established that he's an adjusted and productive member of society, right? Sooner or later you'll get a baseline understanding of how the player sees their character, and then you can use this joint, common, consensual understanding as the basis for your framing. "After you come back from Joe's poetry bash..." will fly with the player because he participated in developing Joe and his character's poetry habit, and thus garnered buy-in for the fact that indeed, his character might well be walking about town at night because of something like that.\n<blockquote>Something like this:<br/>(calm down, breath deeply)"Oh, you must have some strong feelings about this. Do you want to talk about it? Should we take a break? And if you're ready, we can continue with the game as well."<br/></blockquote>\nYeah, I'd walk at this point. The GM goes on a bullshit authority trip, I disagree, and then he starts patronizing me? Adult discussion does not work by sending your players to a time-out and then proceeding as if they had agreed with your solution. You need to talk over the method of the game and come to an agreement on whether it's kosher for the GM to decide on scene framing unilaterally. (Assuming the game is not built on that premise to begin with - presumably this is not the case if we're having this discussion in the middle of the game.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390392/#Comment_390392" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-16T02:47:59+00:00" title="September 16, 2012  2:47AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2012 6:34AM by Johnstone.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>If it's my job to frame scenes hard: "Yeah, but you <i>did</i> and you <i>are</i>.

If you want you players to be less protective of their character czipeter I think you should be the one to be less protective first, let yourself be vulnerable and be willing to stop protecting you idea, and trust the player to redefine the scene. If she going to be able to learn to trust you and had over control of her character to you, lead by example.

I played traditional for 15 years before I discovered the forge and story-games. Prior to that, my style was largely based off of my older brother GMing his friends in D&amp;D. When my brother GM'd, he was hard and unwavering - he would let you slip up and create all sorts of chaos and force you to deal with it. He would throw unfair situations at you and if you didn't like it, well tough, don't play then. But, even though the situations were tough and unfair, there was always a way out if you were clever enough and your dice rolls were good. That's the way all of his gaming group GM'd and everyone accepted it and everyone had fun. That's how most of my gaming group was, until we brought on people who didn't spend the last six years playing with my older brother and playing that way.<br/><br/>I remember playing Shadowrun with my group and my brother's girlfriend decided she wanted to play. I was SMing and I had some goons steal the player's stuff and run away. Mita (my bro's gf) declared that she runs after the car and throws a tracking device onto it. My reaction was, "But you don't have any tracking devices." She was like, "Why not? I'm a spy, shouldn't I have something cool like that?" And I was like, "Well, you can definitely go buy one from the blackmarket, but you didn't buy one when you made your character, so if it's not written down on your sheet, you don't have one." She got sour and wanted to stop playing and I got frusterated because I didn't really want her character to be able to track the goons, I had a different plan for how they would find them.<br/><br/>Years later, I thought about that incident and was embarassed by the rail-roading. I think it really changed for me when I read Lady Blackbird. i was amazed by how such a small game could make so much sense. That was really the point where I had an epiphany about how RPG's can work. Especially the advice for GM's.

But regardless, whether that's an unfair "grrr challenge" judgement or not, I figure that if you get to make up whatever the excuse or chain of reasons that got you to have a conversation with this guy on his yacht was, then we can compromise and get some version of the scene I want to see that you don't feel put-out by, because you can still have a lot of control over the situation. That's a scene-framing problem--we have a disagreement over the scene framing but if we are both here to play the same game, we have ways to work it out. I mean, "why doesn't that work for you?

It leaves some things open to the player to respond to: How'd you end up here? Why are you naked? What's your relationship with this guy? If the player's like, "Hell no, I would NOT do that," then you have a pretty disturbing plot on your hands, but at least it's a plot that leaves the player some agency and control of her character. "Waking up in a <i>lover's</i> bed," however, is less okay. It puts emotions in that character's heart that the player never agreed to put there. I can imagine some games in which that kind of collaborative character development might be okay, but in most stuff I've played/run, it wouldn't fly.<br/><br/>All of that said, you should generally make sure your players are going to be comfortable with sexual content at all. It's jarring to show up for what you thought would be a PG-13 rated action movie and suddenly find yourself seeing naked people. It's especially jarring if a male GM is narrating a female player's female character in a compromising position. Even among friends, if not everyone has been established as "on board" with that kind of thing, it's way too easy to interpret that as the GM getting his jollies from fantasizing about his friend's proxy in the game, even if that's not your intent, you know?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390446/#Comment_390446" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-16T13:49:27+00:00" title="September 16, 2012  1:49PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2012 2:00PM by w176.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The scene:<br/>The thing was (luckily) not actual play.

This might be for many reasons, but many girls have sexual scenes pushed or forced on them in male dominated gaming groups in a creepy way. So when a girl signals she doesn't want sexual scenes you should respect that. <br/><br/>(And you might yourself behaving creepily if you targeted the female player for a sexual scene in a way you didn't do with the male players, especially after she signaled by making a frigid character that she didn't want sexual scenes)<br/><br/>B: She made a character and made clear that "frigid" was central to the character concept. The first thing you wanted to try was to undermined that choice and deny her agency over what type of character she wanted to play. This is once more extra problematic, because female players and female character are often pushed/forced into sexual roles in a way that their male counterparts isn't.<br/><br/><br/>If I where you I would examine closely why you felt it was so important to try how "flexible" she was with a sexual scene, despite signals that that she didn't want sexual scene for the character and perhaps for herself in the game. We all all shaped by society and it easy to sexually objectify female character and female players unconsciously even if that wasn't you intention. But being creepy unintentionally doesn't make you any less creepy.<br/><br/>Since it was a sexual scene I'm very curious why you felt so upset about when a female player protested when having a sexual scene framing thrown at her, first thing after she created the character that might be a very clear signal that she didn't want sexual scenes?<br/><br/>I also like to ask if you threw sexual scenes at the male players and make characters to the same degree you did against the female players and female character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee" title="TildeSee"><img alt="TildeSee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee">TildeSee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390449/#Comment_390449" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-16T13:58:49+00:00" title="September 16, 2012  1:58PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2012 1:59PM by TildeSee.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, it sounds like it was a hypothetical scene not actually in play to see what folks boundaries are.

I can't say that until tested it's so obvious to me that the player was saying she was uninterested in sexual scenes due to making her character "frigid", as in the sorts of groups I play in character defining statements tend to get made to be tested, but in the groups I play with, we always have conversations about what lines and veils we want, so that nobody or at least hopefully nobody is put in an uncomfortable place. Always.

We were exchanging emails about an upcoming game. 4 of us. Somehow, amongst other things (what does a character sheet look like, what am I aiming for setting-wise, etc.) lines &amp; veils came to my mind and tried to ask them how much is too much. Let's say that wasn't successful. For her it was hard to get that I am not asking about her character's, but her own attitude, comfortability around these story elements (blood &amp; guts, sexuality-nakedness, and swearing). By the time, we arrived on the same terms, the emails were private (yes, she was the first one to leave the others from the address line). The aforementioned test scene came out of this conversation indirectly as her answer was like "sexuality: as long as you don't put my character in such a situation by force, it's okay with me". I felt like it not being so much the answer to the how much is too much question, so I wanted to probe further.<br/>You must want to know this as well: this is an on-line, voice chat-based game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390499/#Comment_390499" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T03:01:19+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  3:01AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2012 3:10AM by w176.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Using your GM mandate to fram scene to put her character in a sexual situation without her consent is a way to by force put her character in a sexual situation. Even if this case in an out-of-character force. Duh. <br/><br/>It no less putting her character in a sexual situation with force if you say <i>"And you character consented to it, because I said so. (By saying it was with a lover.)"</i><br/><br/>My suggestion to you if someone say <i>"Don't put my character in a sexual situation by force" </i>you don't put her character in a sexual situation by force in any way, and especially not by saying that her character was okay with it. I also suggest then you don't whine and call it a malaise when the player who already said that she don't want her character out in a sexual situation with force says that she not okay with you putting her character in a sexual situation by force.<br/><br/>My suggestion is that you next time simply say:<br/><br/><i>"Okay. Then I wont initiate any sexual scene for you character. You will only end up in a sexual scene if you set the scene that way, or if you character decide to seduce someone."</i><br/><br/>In addition: When someone has an issue with something, probing to get in-depth information on the issue isn't the right way to go. Probing can end up with you prodding around in old wounds in a way that both invasive and hurts. When someone has an issue with someone you simply respect that and ask where to draw the line.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390503/#Comment_390503" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T03:19:03+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  3:19AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2012 3:19AM by Graham.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Lines &amp; veils came to my mind and tried to ask them how much is too much.

It's hard to say up-front: hey, guys, I don't want you to put my character in sexual situations.<br/><br/>You did the right thing in checking the scene with her before framing it. I think it's cool she said no.<br/><br/>I think there is a tension, in indie games, between creating challenging narrative situations (e.g. Kickers) and maintaining a safe space. You created a challenging narrative situation: it would have made the player question something about her character.

My concern with that is the following: how can I know that the comfort-hacked rules will be just as functional as the original? And if we finally make ourselves very comfortable, who on Earth will be able to take us back to the original game (the one in which there was so many uncomfortable things, we still remember)? My gut feeling tells me that the comfortable (and the comfort-hacked) games are an alibi for a large portion of gaming groups hanging together. But they are not really enjoying themselves in the game. I am (or at least was) part of a lot of these groups and we enjoyed joking about the game and talking about related and unrelated matters much more than playing the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w176" title="w176"><img alt="w176" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nZVYYAKMQQQR6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w176">w176</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390510/#Comment_390510" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T04:09:02+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  4:09AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You don't need to change the rules.

Looking very good, Epidiah! (Epi's one of my favourite designers, he always pleases me.)<br/><br/>Epi doesn't go into the details of how these types of games are played in the text, but <i>Swords Without Master</i> seems to be on the farther edge of the continuum between experiental and dramatic gaming: character experience is secondary to storytelling interests in many of the game's procedures. Characters are not set in stone, but rather discovered through storytelling. Also, the game is deliberately situated in trusting, intimate creative space by opting to provide players with wide authorities regarding e.g. scene framing.<br/><br/>The important lesson to take from here is that there is no guarantee that this type of game, or any type of game, will work for all crews. Some games are more intimate and trust-based than others, and this is an important dividing line to know. In this case I'm reading the text and seeing a game that will only work if the players are consistently capable of creative cooperation: you need to be able to frame scenes that are fun for all, you need to be able to describe your character's actions and nature in a compelling way, and so on and so forth. The game text doesn't provide any real tools for what to do with creative discordance because it's the sort of game you would only play with a same-minded crew that is capable of dealing with these creative issues themselves. It's a game where I would stick close to genre conventions and not take many creative risks if I were playing with strangers; creative concord is built over time, we have to show others with small signs where we're willing to go and what we're capable of appreciating.<br/><br/>Because we're discussing scene framing, it should be noted that the way SwM handles scene framing (aggressive GM control) is a model example of features that makes the game only functional in a trusting creative environment. Where the game text says that the GM gets to pick the next scene what it really means is that the GM should pick the next scene <i>with an eye on player buy-in (which is a function of established plot and characterization), and ready to renegotiate if he manages to invent something unacceptable to the other players.</i> That latter part is often not said in a game text like this because it already assumes a priori creative concord. You don't even get the total failure state (the one where the GM has to discard his idea and try again) in practice in a group like this, as everybody's riffing so strongly on the same creative wavelength and the level of trust is so high that it's a once in a blue moon event that you'll stumble on something that is not acceptable.<br/><br/>In summation, what I think we have here is different assumptions about the underlying social context of play. Epidiah doesn't even acknowledge the possibility that the GM might flub a scene, so he doesn't address the event with a special rules procedure. The missing procedure is definitely not "players just need to suck it, bitches", though; my experience has always been that the natural and functional procedure that Epi leaves unsaid is consensual in nature.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390517/#Comment_390517" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T05:39:56+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  5:39AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To bring what I write above back into concrete advice, Peter, I think that you're misreading the rules of the game when you insist that the GM has a no-veto privilege of framing whatever he wants. Rather, my reading of the rules is that the GM has a <i>responsibility</i> to frame, not a right: his responsibility is to find the logical red string of the story in development and follow that in the manner I sketch above. His success is measured by the willingness of the other players to buy into each scene as they come up. The scenes might be surprising and creatively daring, but only as a secondary concern to active buy-in.<br/><br/>So I don't think that you'd be changing the game into an unofficial comfort version by requiring yourself to frame logically and respectfully towards the setting, character and plot. There probably are games out there that specifically request GMs to push with uncomfortable and fractured framing, but this is not one of those. You can only push characters in <i>Swords Without Master</i> within the context of player buy-in (that is, you can push characters and suggest outrageous reinterpretation, but if the player doesn't buy your idea, your only option is to back off), as is the case in most sane designs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee" title="TildeSee"><img alt="TildeSee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee">TildeSee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390519/#Comment_390519" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T06:05:55+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  6:05AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> The aforementioned test scene came out of this conversation [on where to draw lines] indirectly as her answer was like "sexuality: as long as you don't put my character in such a situation by force, it's okay with me".

First off, "rules" vs "guidelines" is a fine distinction at best in RPGs, and a discussion I - for one - don't feel the need to get into. Second, yes, you should always pay close attention. Reading <a href="/forums/profile/czipeter">@czipeter</a> favourably, my assumption is that he did that, as it seems he knows the player reasonably well and is likely a fairly capable body-language-reader.<br/><br/>I re-read the Line in question, and I'm going to posit a slightly edited response to the one before. Armed only with the notion that the player explicitly did not want to be put into a sexual situation <i>by force</i> (my assumption being "in-game fictional force", i.e. rape, as opposed to "dramatic force", informed by scene framing or natural narrative consequences), Peter proceeded to test what the actual boundaries were by framing a theoretical test scene where the character woke up in a <i>lover's</i> bed (implying consent). Could this happen, he asks? What pre-established fiction or rationale would have to go into making this scenario coherent with your character concept? None, she says - under no possible circumstance could that situation occur to my character.<br/><br/>Now, you and I and the Internet know this is not true, assuming the character is indeed of human origin and have a personality which could change over time, which is what drama-play is all about. What the player more likely was trying to communicate was <i>I, the player, do not want such a scene to occur in this game, given my current frame of mind and the dynamics of the table</i>. If this is true, she failed to communicate this fact twice: once when Peter asked about Lines and Veils, and again when asked about the test scene.<br/><br/>Furthermore, you and I and the Internet know that in order for drama to be compelling, it has to touch us in unfamiliar and possibly uncomfortable ways. Player discomfort is a powerful though dangerous tool in a GM's toolkit, and the best way to use any such tool is to read the safety warnings, create a safe environment, and test it out carefully until you can wield it proficiently. It seems to me that's what Peter was trying to do - maybe not flawlessly, but this certainly doesn't read to me as an "RPG horror story" with an abusive, sexist GM. In fact, my guess is that Peter framed this test scene not because the player or PC was a woman, but specifically <i>because</i> the player had indicated discomfort with a certain kind of sexual content, so he tested out a different - lighter - form of sexual content to ensure that'd be both OK and possibly a bit discomforting - and therefore conducive to drama - to the player.<br/><br/>I'm suggesting here that Peter didn't do anything wrong in framing this test scene for this player in this circumstance, although it may have been more conducive to ask for clarifications by private email ahead of the game instead. Rather, I feel Peter fulfilled his GM responsibilities - maybe even went above and beyond - but the situation broke down due to poor communication, mostly it seems on part of the player in question. If she had reservations about <i>any</i> sexual content involving her character, she should've been up-front about this during the Lines and Veils section.<br/><br/>Compare: "My character is a really nice person who never does anything wrong. As a Line, I'd like to never see my character murdering another person in cold blood."<br/>Test scene: "If I were to frame a scene where you've spanked your child and your husband is angry with you, would that work?"<br/>Reply: "No. My character could <i>never, ever,</i> have reached a point where she could possibly have done that, no matter the internal and external stressors in her life."<br/>Probable reality / truer answer: "That's not what I want this game to be about, and not an area I want drama or character development in. I want my character to be non-negotiably likable and gentle. Please try again."<br/><br/>My expectation is that some of the dogpiling in this thread is due to a reaction to the generally unfavourable light Peter is shining on the player in question, starting from the OP. These may all be Peter's fair observations or not, but I suspect they stem from frustration and personality conflicts and is actually polluting the ability to give more useful general advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390634/#Comment_390634" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-18T05:08:05+00:00" title="September 18, 2012  5:08AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2012 5:11AM by Graham.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that's an appalling analysis, Lachek.

I'm a big fan of the X-Card technique. All I'm saying is that someone cringing a bit during a dramatic RPG is not a clear indication that they want to step away from the table, and getting someone to a point where they're cringing a bit - as a GM or as a fellow player - is not necessarily a bad thing.<br/><br/>Misdirecting your own discomfort over a subject by claiming your character would never ever in any possible way be put into a situation like that is not good communication, and is frustrating to the GM and the other players. Insistence, or the question "why?", would never be levied by anyone at my table if the player had said "I don't feel comfortable with that" instead of "my character wouldn't do that". The X-Card is a tactile, silent "I don't feel comfortable with that", and is totally cool by me and anyone I'd like to play with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>"No!

With the context established in post 1, he sounded kind of jerky, but not unreasonable. The next several posts, culminating in the one where "Oh yeah, and it was a girl and I threw her in a sexual scene after she said she wasn't interested in them," made me think some pretty horrid thoughts, but I tried to be somewhat charitable based on possible misunderstanding. When further context was given, making the scene entirely hypothetical and part of a discussion on what lines to draw with her, well, he still sounded like a jerk for putting the player in an unfavourable light in early, and to a lesser extent later, posts, but it at least sounded like it wasn't coming from a douchey place. I don't feel much of the advice in this thread has been per se polluted. <br/><br/>Anyway, yes Lachek, it would be much better if people could be much more lojban about how they describe their issues with a situation. As it stands, though, folk will use the language they've been taught to use, as well as language that disclaims personal responsibility, especially in uncomfortable circumstances. That's why dealing with things that cause discomfort needs to be done on a very consensual basis. This is why in the BDSM world, we have safe words, and monogamish folk have extensive conversations to keep on base about how relationships are developing. Likewise, crap like "discomfort drama" needs an up front and continual discussion about whether or not everyone is up for it. With some people, I just won't do it. With others, I do nothing but. That's all predicated on the people, though, and whether or not they're into that sort of thing. From my current, limited, view I don't think the player in question wants drama that tickles her discomfort, and yes, while it would be nice if she could say it like that, in absence of her saying outright "Yes I would like to you push my boundaries," consent for that sort of thing has not been given and it ought be avoided.<br/><br/>EDIT: Lachek - basically to boil down, you're saying, "The onus is on the player to communicate discomfort," where I'm saying, "The onus is on us all to make sure others are fine with uncomfortable content."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390640/#Comment_390640" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-18T06:45:51+00:00" title="September 18, 2012  6:45AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2012 6:49AM by lachek.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            X-Card = tactile safeword. Not sure how <a href="/forums/profile/jenskot">@jenskot</a> feels about that comparison, but it was evident to me from the moment I saw it. It's a good technique. Use it.<br/><br/>I'm not disagreeing with you Aaron, nor have I been - we all have to pay attention and be respectful. Asking for Lines and Veils is being respectful. Pitching a theoretical test scene to elucidate on questionable Lines is being respectful. But shunning a whole major area of human experience like the plague in your entire game because someone once said they were uncomfortable with rape scenes (like the majority of the population, myself included) so maybe they're uncomfortable with other sex stuff too and they're just not a good communicator = weak sauce = dull game.<br/><br/>The game IS communication. Test framing, X-Card use, and being careful and attentive, during the early game is key to establishing better shared pitch for the late game.<br/><br/>And, are you implying there's a kind of drama that's <i>not</i> discomfort based? I need to know more about that. I thought those were called comedies?<br/><br/>I'm really not being flippant here. I mean, I played <i>Marvel Heroic</i> and felt intense discomfort with the notion that my character, F-ING THOR, had been pinned to the wall and badly injured by the RHINO, whom he had <i>failed to even scratch</i> with F-ING MJOLNIR. I had a steaming furious rage boiling inside. And then I turned it around next turn, with a daft mechanical maneuver that turned my substantial wounds into advantages and beat the snot out of his social track through intimidating him because YOU DARE THINK YOU CAN BEST THE GOD OF F-ING THUNDER?!?<br/><br/>It was dramatic to me not because of the dice rolls or the massive beat down but <i>because</i> I was so attached to one outcome and so incredibly furiously upset at the notion of the other outcome, a direct result of having been put into a situation discomforting to me.<br/><br/>No, it's not the same thing as e.g. rape, not even the same parallel universe, but I think it provides another datapoint to the good drama = player discomfort hypothesis.<br/><br/>That's of course not to say that good drama = all there is to RPGs. But I think when you sit down to play an explicitly dramatic game, a certain amount of discomfort is to be expected, and should be anticipated with bated breath and treasured once it's there. Frex, you don't sit down to play Dogs and expect none of your buttons to be pushed even a little.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee" title="TildeSee"><img alt="TildeSee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee">TildeSee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390642/#Comment_390642" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-18T07:10:42+00:00" title="September 18, 2012  7:10AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2012 7:12AM by TildeSee.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ennh, fine, you're using the word drama in a form different from me.

Without knowing exactly what was said, nobody should be villainizing Peter or victimizing the Player. Nobody should be dogpiling or running away from the conversation. Those are just over reactions.<br/><br/>That said, Peter definitely did not do himself any favors by inferring that there is something wrong with the player or trying to tell her to take a "time-out". That's not productive and most definitely contributes to the backlash in the thread and the sore feelings between the GM and the player.<br/><br/>The bottom line is this is a conflict of interest exacerbated by poor communication. Peter wants to push buttons and the player doesn't want to be pushed. Both Peter and the Player are having a hard time communicating their feelings and it does not sound like any attempt at compromise was made on either side.<br/><br/>DO: Compromise to make sure everyone is happy with what's going on in the game. Save that other idea for a different player who specifies they're cool with it.<br/><br/>DONT: Make the player feel bad for not liking the scene you frame.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee" title="TildeSee"><img alt="TildeSee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee">TildeSee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390650/#Comment_390650" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-18T07:49:20+00:00" title="September 18, 2012  7:49AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not trying to villainise Peter, but I agree, things are too hot here, and I may be coming off poorly.

This is probably - and rightly - very subjective. If you move in BDSM circles, which I do not personally, you'll be more aware and sensitive to issues around sexual consent in particular. If you move in very religious circles, which I also do not, you may be more aware and sensitive to issues surrounding faith. And if you play with people who you know to move in those circles, you'll be more sensitive on certain specific topics. That's just the nature of human communication.<br/><br/>I'm currently playing a game of Monsterhearts where the group has several people with strong phobias and anxiety. I'm very careful before introducing various species of vermin I know to be off-limits, but the group has no problem at all with in-your-face sexually explicit scenes (which frequently instead give <i>me</i> the heebie-jeebies - I need to remember to use the X-Card!). You adjust to whom you're dealing with and everything you know about them informs how you act. I got in over my head once, when I messed with someone's NPC family members - that was an area I was not aware was a sore spot for that player (and no Lines mentioned during our Line setting), we retconned the scene, and worked it out via private email between sessions.<br/><br/>A default "no" seems very difficult to me as a general rule. More like, some topics will be default "no" for a certain group makeup. Like, I know one player for whom I'd never bring up topics surrounding Existentialism without his explicit permission.<br/><br/>I'm gonna take a breath too.

You talk about how something happen, but doesn't say anything about your gaming style. I mean, could the PC just thrown a chair through the window and then leaped out? Could the player make up who the other people in the scene were?<br/><br/>Because you (czipeter) haven't given your gaming style, you will get answers from all kinds of perspective. In a traditional game, you need to be careful how you frame the scene. You can't skip too much and assume things. It has to be clear and played out (or discussed) before you can frame anything. The only exception is probably surprise attacks, but even then it can be complicated.<br/><br/>In a more free kind of gaming style, where everybody can contribute, you have to earn your players trust first. Perhaps by a little storytelling exercise, either in-game or not, to show how to play the game?<br/><br/>And as always, you need to respect the past of the players. Violence, sex (or those two combined) and even religion can be a sensitive topic to play out for some players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390806/#Comment_390806" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-19T12:11:06+00:00" title="September 19, 2012 12:11PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I haven't used it, but I know my group.
