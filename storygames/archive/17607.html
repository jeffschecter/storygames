On Mondays, during a study period at the end of the day, I've been picking 4-5 kids to participate in a G/PG Rated version of Everyone Is John and they really loved it. One student even told me he got his mom to GM a game with he and his two little brothers. Two weeks ago I introduced them to <a href="http://danielsolisblog.blogspot.com/2009/08/happy-birthday-robot.html" rel="nofollow">Happy Birthday Robot!</a> which they loved and is now a Center during my Guided Reading block. I also threw together a Fiasco Insta Set Up for Dungeon Delve and used the Soft Tilt and Aftermath (with editing for language of course) and they enjoyed it a lot. <br/><br/>Further, I've found Vincent Baker's philosophy of play outlined in the MC chapter in Apocalypse World to be reflective of the current movement in education to have the Teacher act as a facilitator and guiding hand in the background while Students are allowed to explore, discuss, and critique concepts. I have also been reading over <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Second-City-Guide-Improv-Classroom/dp/0787996505" rel="nofollow">The Second City Guide to Improv in the Classroom</a> which has created some even stronger connections in my mind between story gaming and formal learning.<br/><br/>That said, what experiences have any of you had incorporating story gaming techniques outside of gaming? (particularly education, but I'd love to hear about any uses)<br/><br/>Also, what systems or story gaming techniques do you see as being appropriate and beneficial to upper elementary students? (think 8-10 year olds) I work with very low socio-economic students with, what I would consider, sub-literate homes. So anything that would provoke and encourage deep analysis of texts through gaming would be appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398987/#Comment_398987" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-28T07:47:08+00:00" title="November 28, 2012  7:47AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have no personal experince with teaching through roleplaying, but you might want to check out <a href="http://osterskov.dk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://osterskov.dk/</a> It's a school that teaches entirely through roleplaying with great success.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_398992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398992/#Comment_398992" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-28T08:45:21+00:00" title="November 28, 2012  8:45AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Further, I've found Vincent Baker's philosophy of play outlined in the MC chapter in Apocalypse World to be reflective of the current movement in education to have the Teacher act as a facilitator and guiding hand in the background while Students are allowed to explore, discuss, and critique concepts.</blockquote>\n"The Ignorant Gamemaster," I love it!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398995/#Comment_398995" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-28T09:18:12+00:00" title="November 28, 2012  9:18AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 28, 2012 9:20AM by akooser.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/huckabees">@huckabees</a><br/>I have a write up somewhere describing Vincent's MC style and how it relates to science teaching.

Not a lot different.<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/15600/rpg-for-a-group-of-10-15-students/p1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/15600/rpg-for-a-group-of-10-15-students/p1</a><br/><br/>Also, I've been thinking that The Quiet Year could be tweaked in to a fun story/geography game suitable for students. But I haven't done it yet. Still waiting to play it RAW a couple times before I start rewriting it.<br/><br/>In Los Angeles there's a relatively new group (friends of mine) experimenting with using larp in the classroom. Primarily they've used it as a way to encourage kids to do math exercises.

Looking forward to the experiment.<br/><br/>For classroom use, the first obstacle is the length. It's supposed to last 3-3.5 hours, which is WAY WAY WAY too long for that sort of activity in the classroom.<br/><br/>Also, it's really unstructured and open ended for unguided use by younger kids. I'd dial it in to be something much more focused and guided.<br/><br/>And I'd probably work in some sort of more competitive angle. Not sure how, yet.
