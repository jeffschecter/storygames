(the physical bits I mean. IIRC, you mentioned seeing some off them being offloaded some time back)<br/><br/>I saw your sketches for Goblin stuff. Out of curiosity, have you found compatible physical stuff? Any thoughts on what that might look like? (sketches or thoughts appreciated). For me, my closest far-out concept (among several others) is more Pumpkin Town/Nightmare Before X-Mas influenced.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
