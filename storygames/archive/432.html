                    After reading Ben Lehman's review of Stained Glass for the Game Chef comp (http://www.1km1kt.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=773&amp;sid=e9cfa561aab65da0cb7b410fcd4da2dc), I started to think about escalation in rpg.  I may have missed a thread, but during a search didn't turn up anything.  It seems to me this was recently discussed somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
First, I'm curious if there are any good essays on the subject.<br/>
<br/>
Second, I'd like to hear thoughts on how to use escalation in games, what is escalation, different ways to look at escalation, how to design for, and how it affects game play.  Anyone care to comment?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Bryan                </div>

                            Escalation's most prominent example is Dogs in the Vineyard, where it is an explicit mechanic.  Prior examples would be, say, Sorcerer, with the GM guiding play towards Bangs.  The goal is to push the players into decisions of greater and greater significance.<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> Ah, having actually read the referenced review, I see that you're talking explicitly about the Dogs mechanic, not the phenomenon in general.  In Dogs, Escalation is taking the current conflict into a new arena of conflict.  So if you've only been talking with JoeNPC and you pull out a gun, you're escalating the conflict.                        </div>

                            Also, to reference that specific review: <br/><br/>In Dogs you roll dice for what you're doing. You can add more dice by narrating in different traits. You can then, if you need or want to, escalate in order to bring more dice into the conflict. So, for example, if you're talking to a mother of 4 about how she shouldn't hit her children, and she isn't listening, you can force her to pay attention by punching her in the face. <br/><br/>Tied into this is the concept of fallout. In Dogs on your turn you "raise" (take action) by narrating something and pushing foward two dice to show the mechanical impact of what you're doing. The other person then has to "see" (block/dodge) by matching your number with two dice and narration about how they turn the blow, or by "taking the blow" (eating it) by using any number of dice more than two and narration about how you smack them silly. If you take the blow you end up having to take "fallout" later -- a cominbation of dramatic involvement, moral, experience, and trauma that makes the game keep pushing from one conflict to another. <br/><br/>All of this together makes Dog's conflicts pretty fluid and dynamic. You can have people change the number of dice they have by the actions and levels of violence they are willing to use. You can have people play with strategy by using lots of dice to take fallout (thus eating your dice up) and thus tying the conflict to the process of character development. Combine them all and you have a system that lets you make statements, push resources, and get into serious trouble. <br/><br/>The game being reviewed, from the sounds of it (haven't read it myself) took one single aspect of this resolution system and put it in place without the other aspects, and without replacements for those aspects. So you have one pool of dice (yes/no?) that you roll once and use pretty statically (yes/no?) -- which means that without the ability to use strategy, push the characters to bigger heights of badness, or change around the numbers of dice being used that the back and forth system has no bite. You roll, look at each others dice, and instantly know who has won.                        </div>

                            Hey!<br/>
<br/>
Basically, this is my beef: If you're going to remove escalation from Dogs, you might as well just roll your dice and sum them for a winner.  The result will be the same in nearly all cases, and the second method is much, much faster.<br/>

                            What all is the mechanical effect of escalation, again? Does it just let you pull in more dice, or reroll the ones you already threw, or...? Because that doesn't sound so essential to a bidding setup.                        </div>

<p>Escalation, in Dogs, allows you to pull in more dice.  By "escalation" I mean any act which pulls dice off of your sheet, whether it is traits, belongings, free relationship dice, or attribute dice.  Bringing in any of these is a form of escalation, even if it isn't called "escalation" by the rules text.</p>
<p>A mechanic which allowed you to, at some cost mechanical or non-, reroll spent dice would achieve the same effect.  Or a mechanic which allowed you to fiddle with the dice on the table.  Or whatever.</p>
<p>The point is, if you're going to throw down your huge die pool and then just match them up, that's the <em>same thing</em> as just counting them.  This is just simple math.</p>

<p>P.S.  Dogs has actually three things going for it -- escalation, fallout, and task resolution in the fiction.  Right now I'm just talking about escalation, because of the thread title, but all three are important.</p>

Co-incidentally, exactly the choices I'm currently dithering over for Covenant rewrites. Currently it's fiddling with dice on table, but it's surprisingly clunky in play.<br/><br/>What all escalation mechanics do really well is highlight the point at which you are unwilling to pay the cost of winning. Dogs does this really well. I could convince Sister Marie to stop sinning, but I have to use "big and brutish" to do so. I might get to succeed, but in a way I'm not happy using. Which way I end up choosing says something about my character. <br/><br/>Interestingly this is also why you need good stakes in escalation games, cos otherrwise it's like playing poker without money (as was commented at the Conpulsion games design seminar) and you can bow out with no real cost. What's at stake has to be important to the player.<br/><br/>-Matt                        </div>

In my experience, it doesn't do much; since it dumps a pile of dice on your opponnent's side as well as your own, it usually ends up just prolonging a conflict you're going to lose anyways.                        </div>

                            I think I'm catching on.  I guess I need to play Dogs.  Let me ask another question:  In D&amp;D as hit points are lost in combat would that be concidered an excalation?  Would you look at it like, the less hit points that you have the closer to death you are and are you willing to take the risk of death to kill the beast.<br/>

<br/>
In Capes, another player putting dice on a Conflict you really really want to control is escalation.<br/>
In Sorcerer, the GM revealing the machinations behind your Kicker and putting you on the spot is escalation.<br/>
In Vampire, when it turns out that the elder that you've been working for has set you up -- that's escalation.                        </div>
