Then forces intervened and they woke up in an asylum (some might call this railroading or perhaps a bang). I could have started them off in the asylum but I wanted to make it all the more confusing.<br/><br/>In a previous incarnation as a Man in Black, I wrote a Hellboy scenario which started in the middle of a fight, and then the players found out why they were fighting. It seemed to me to fit the comic idiom. SJG didn't like this and I was asked to rewrite it in chronological order, which I did.<br/><br/>And of course, there's John Tynes' brilliant Cthulhu game In Media Res in which 4 amnesiacs find themselves in a house with a dead body (we played it as a LARP but you can tabletop it too).<br/><br/>In Creative Writing, especially where short stories are concerned, we've been told to cut to the chase. Indeed Checkov said something along the lines that a short story is all middle.<br/><br/>So I wondered what the SG view was on this issue. Do you prefer to start scenarios in the thick of the action, with not necessarily a full understanding of the facts, or do you want character development and then on with the show?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pete" title="Pete"><img alt="Pete" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pete">Pete</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211560/#Comment_211560" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T03:42:54+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  3:42AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2009 3:43AM by Pete.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, so long as it fits in nicely with the story, then I certainly prefer <i>in media res</i>.

My particular favourite, as you know, Steve, is starting with dream sequences. Nothing like starting a scenario by telling someone they've been buried alive.<br/><br/>With The Dying Of St Margaret's, I wanted to keep the structure really very Lovecraftian, with a slow approach to the world affected by the horror, rather than plunging people straight in. That said, another way of starting might be interesting.<br/><br/>My favourite way of starting Lacuna, these days, is to tell people they wake up in a hotel room (which is, of course, in Blue City). Then they start getting messages from Control. All this happens before character creation.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211568/#Comment_211568" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T04:40:45+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  4:40AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'm a big fan of starting in the middle of things.

However, if you don't get into the action quickly with an adventure, watch out.

In fact, this happens more often than not. I also have had a lot of bad experiences in the past with folks going to the middle skipping the stuff that actually makes the middle matter, killing all the context and emotional continuity that makes the story work. This happens a lot, because many gamers are tone deaf. <br><br>(A good author doesn't generally have either of these problems in a short story, which is one of the places where the different arts really are different, I guess. The tangle of group narratives that form stories and the ongoing emotional situation in a game just really don't map out to the classical short story model here.)<br><br>However, that said, when imr is used for a good reason, with understanding of the affect, it can make me happy. The OP example of "meet on a train, wake up in an asylum" would probably make me happy, because its a rather CoC thing to have happen. There is a congruity between player and character that it introduces, which while it isn't always my cuppa, sure can work wonders in CoC. And, frankly, I'd rather just be framed into the asylum than play scene after scene where I attempt to escape but can't, and so end up there anyway.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211616/#Comment_211616" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T09:19:26+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  9:19AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's a valid starting technique, but as it's been said, you have to do it well (read: in a way your players accept).

The way it gets referred to is "body and a gun" -- because my group are all clever monkeys, and noted that structurally it almost always starts a session where one of the PCs is standing in a scene out of context from the last session, with something bad or strange going on. A dead body on the floor and the PC standing over them with a smoking gun in their hand is the classic example. <br/><br/>From there we often play some crazy thing happening (cops come in!) and then flash back and play out everything that went into making up the moment we saw. Sometimes we find out what we saw isn`t what we thought it was ("it wasn't me, it was the one armed man!") sometimes we find out its worse. Those sessions everyone has a goal and we all play towards it, which is fun. (In PTA it works well when no one has a high spotlight episode, so the structure of the plot can dominate a little.) <br/><br/>So yea, that's a little IMR trick that I've had good luck with, even in a group of immersives who like to know what their character knows in every scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211787/#Comment_211787" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T18:56:01+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  6:56PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>ME:  Who is guarding the necromancer?</blockquote>\nWhen I read this, my first thought was that they were guarding him from harm.  Like, he was on their team.  The next question wasn't "Ok, who's the squad's necromancer?"<br/><br/>As to In Media Res, I have to say it works really well for the action and horror genres.  In most games, my players will stall somewhat, as mentioned above, wondering what their character would do given no info, but I allow a question or two that I answer pretty tersely to drive home the "action/decision now" aspect of it.<br/><br/>As to railroading, I can't see that it is any more railroading than "you meet in a tavern."  When I was younger and less understanding, I would usually answer anyone who claimed their character wouldn't be in the tavern with a comment that the character has therefore missed the adventure and that they needed to generate a new one who wouldn't if they wanted to play.  I have grown since then.  Now, those characters get kidnapped and drug into the tavern as a human (or whatnot) shield by the madman (or whatnot) who confronts the rest of the group.

Graham's game of Trail of Cthulhu last week demonstrated this to us. It was even more railroaded than my game this week, but that didn't mean we couldn't react to what was going on in ways that made sense for the characters and were enjoyable for us as players.<br/><br/>I think bang/railroad is just one of those story game vocab issues, a bit like illusionism, drift or others. The nicer sounding term is privileged.<br/><br/>Whatever you like to call it, something happens outside the player's control that forces them to react and it's a question of what is suitable for the audience, the game and the mood as to how far you can push it. If by calling it a bang, instead of a railroad, more gamers will accept it, I'm up for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211840/#Comment_211840" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T02:59:14+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  2:59AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2009 3:05AM by Graham.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wilhelm</cite>Start with the action, or at least in the middle of something.

In Holmesian and Lovercraftian narratives, there are often modal shifts with typcially the introduction being one of scene-setting, the development that of plot and the denoument action. In rich gaming we try not to draw lines between the three but there's nothing wrong with the GM emphasising one other the others, as long as he doesn't try to demodulate.<br/><br/>And when I say demodulate, I am of course talking about play constraints.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211852/#Comment_211852" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T05:14:09+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  5:14AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there is a real and meaningful difference between railroading and aggressive scene framing.<br/><br/>The essence of which is this, aggressive scene framing is merely saying what the game will be about at the outset, it's not really any different than saying a week beforehand "guys, I want to run a prison break game, everyone cool?"

Great technique, I play in a high trust group, we know each other and we're cool to trust each other with stuff that might be a little left field or unusual.  We know none of us railroad or block creative input.<br/><br/>In the past, I have used this once or twice.  I opened a game set in 1850s Central Asia once by saying "right, you're galloping at full tilt, the Turkmeni bandits behind you are firing at you and screaming blood curdling cries, what do you do?"  It worked great, really well, the game kicked off with a bang (using that in the general rather than technical sense) and was huge fun.<br/><br/>So, why don't I use the technique more often?  I tend to chicken out.  Some players do get lost without context, they need to know the situation before they feel they can respond in character, but the people I play with are cool, I just tend to lose my nerve and go for the easier option of slow buildup.  But that can lead to a loss of tension, to the early part of the session, crucial for creating mood, being kind of flat.<br/><br/>We're currently playing Swords and Wizardry on a rotating GM basis, each GM gets one night for their scenario then it's on to the next guy.  Next time it's my slot, I'm starting in media res, because you've reminded me how well it can work and when I only have one night I need to cut to the chase (it's why I'm liking the rotating GM thing for a bit actually, it really makes you focus).  Next game, we open with the pirate vessel sinking as the Hessallion navy bombard it and the crew look expectantly to the PCs, or something along those lines.<br/><br/>Cool thread.  I do think, as noted by Graham, that it's a technique best used sparingly or it loses its impact, but then that's true of so many techniques and used sparingly does not mean not used at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle" title="JCunkle"><img alt="JCunkle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle">JCunkle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211942/#Comment_211942" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T10:17:13+00:00" title="June 12, 2009 10:17AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I use IMR in trad games, I tend to allow the initial scene to be resolved quickly.

Also, in scenario or campaign beginnings, to give the folks a sense of who their characters are, and to play up what their characters do for the others.<br/><br/>Eric Provost did this thing for The Mountain Witch, which I now use pretty much all the time now in adventure games. Basically, the game starts in the middle of a fight, "while the credits roll". There are enemies attacking. There are two "combat rounds". NO DICE ARE ROLLED. You simply describe your character, and what they're doing. You succeed at whatever you're doing, basically. No rules, just description. When round two is over, the fight ends, people say their one liners, and the Real Adventure begins.<br/><br/>Jason's idea is awesome, too.

There's nothing that gets the players more into really understanding their characters than a fast combat, and realizing three rounds in that they weren't using one of their powers/items/abilities to their full extent.<br/>\n<br/>\nI prefer to have this first combat either completely unrelated to the main arc of the story, or only tangentally related, so that decisions in this particular fight won't set the tone for the whole campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also really like this technique for games like Call of Cthulhu where fighting the monsters = death, but a little fight with some mobsters can let the players blow off steam and get their yayas out so they can settle down into serious studying of ancient texts!<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that goodness said, it is very easily overused, especially if it stresses some of your players.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Arty<br/>\n<br/>\nPS: this is my first post in here . . .I think I'm gonna like it here!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212219/#Comment_212219" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-14T11:41:11+00:00" title="June 14, 2009 11:41AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Welcome to Story Games, Kevin!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
