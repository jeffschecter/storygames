For those of you who haven't seen it yet, all of the rules of the game are written out in the SRD. <br/><br/>There are now new examples for each step of character creation, as well as for maneuvers, strikes, resource denials and recoveries, and achievements.  I'm the first to admit that the absence of examples within the text, as opposed to the one long example of play at the end, wasn't necessarily the best choice.  Hindsight, etc.  But adding more examples to the SRD was relatively easy, just time intensive.<br/><br/>I'd be curious to hear if this makes understanding the rules easier for any of you, and what other suggestions you have for things I could add.<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248665/#Comment_248665" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-26T21:05:09+00:00" title="December 26, 2009  9:05PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Totally stoked to read through and gain waves of purer and more quickly-graspable rules instruction!<br/><br/>thanks for putting in the time, now it falls to us to put our spears into the beasts, and their blood into our skin!<br/><br/>ROAR!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
