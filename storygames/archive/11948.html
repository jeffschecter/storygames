I can't help it. A particular mode of play was burned into my brain over the course of 15 years.<br/><br/>I'll spare you the detailed list, but I jotted down 40 different RPGs that I played from 1979 through 1994. I played in home games, I played with a group of older guys at the Air Force base. I played at college. I played at conventions, 4 a year. 40 completely different rulesets. All were fundamentally similar in a very core way.<br/><br/>People assemble. One is the GM. He has done a ton of prep to realize a game world and interesting events that we can engage with as players. We describe what our characters do. Periodically, the GM tells us to roll to see how well we do something we wanted to do. He tells us outcomes of everything we do. He knows all the secrets of the game world. Acting as a "Player", we can talk about metagame stuff, but this is a necessary evil, and too much of it is disruptive. Acting as our Character, we can explore the world and interact with it and each other. Our player knowledge should not intermingle with our character knowledge. Good GMs make their world seem like a real place, and that we have the power to go anywhere and do anything and have a real impact on the world. Bad GMs railroad us through some half-assed story they thought it would be cool to share with a captive audience.<br/><br/>Everything from D&amp;D to Boot Hill to Traveller to Toon to Cthulhu to Paranoia to Gurps to Space 1889 was played this way. 15 years of playing games that were structurally very similar at the core. Different color and setting, different numbers to roll. Same basic structure.<br/><br/>Then, I found LARPs, and they were quite different.<br/>Later still, I found Universalis and Donjon and they were quite different.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266912/#Comment_266912" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T12:42:27+00:00" title="April 13, 2010 12:42PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking that I should do that list-creation thing as well.

Admittedly I could only get my hands on AD&amp;D and GURPS for the first 11 years, but I did play a couple of other systems as well. The only real constant for me was the GM/player split, and the fact that the GM really was the <i>game master</i>. Players say what they're attempting, possibly roll dice, GM interprets that and describes the result. I still see that as a rather strong driving force in modern games. I've just been reading through Trail of Cthulhu and it really follows the same assumption, HeroQuest 2e does too. <br/><br/>I've played a few games that really starkly deviate from this model, but most of them stick to it. This is where I'd wonder if there needs to be another characteristic tagged on. Toon's a bit of an odd one, and I never grokked it, but all the other trad games seem to go with a fixed list of abilities that you could draw from to build your character (with varying degrees of flexibility) and the need to roll for most things. I understand OD&amp;D didn't do this, and if you go really far back it seemed to be a lot more about player skill than character skill. The GM player split changed, but roughly around when I started playing at least from what I got out of the rulebooks and the other people I was playing with it became more about character skill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266987/#Comment_266987" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T16:13:16+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  4:13PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: marknau</cite><br/>My experience with Vampire and other Noun: The Event games was unrelenting Bad GM.

I knew, I hated it, but I didn't feel like I had any choice. Looking back, I can totally see why:<br/><br/>1) I didn't want to play Noun: The Event, I wanted to play D&amp;D. Secretly, so did all of my players. But we were in <i>college</i>, dammit, and D&amp;D was what we did back in middle school. We were <i>way</i> too mature for that now!<br/><br/>2) Because we were too mature to play D&amp;D, we thought anything that we used to do in D&amp;D was now beneath us. Things like Going on Adventures or Having Fun Rolling Dice and Killing Monsters. We didn't know what we <i>were</i> supposed to do, other than a vague notion that it had something to do with Telling A Story.<br/><br/>3) I say "vague notion" because I had a book that spent 40 pages telling me I (not "we", <i>"I"</i>) was supposed to use the rules to Tell A Story and then gave me a hundred pages of rules about the difference between burst and full-auto weapon damage.<br/><br/>4) The book also had lots of overwrought fan-fiction that most of us skipped and some pretty decent (if inconsistent) art that mostly showed brooding vampires and pissed-off werewolves Standing There Posing. So naturally, we decided that Storytelling meant all the players Stand There Posing until I as the Storyteller made stuff happen to them.<br/><br/>5) The stuff I made happen to them would eventually lead to a fight, at which point we all breathed a collective sigh of relief and rolled Initiative...<br/><br/>6) ...after which we all felt vaguely ashamed for Doing It Wrong, since the game was supposed to be about Telling A Story instead of combat. Heck, it said right there in the book (or one of the supplements or something) that "combat munchkins" were bad. <br/><br/>Eventually, after months of doing it wrong, I showed up for the start of a new campaign <i>totally</i> unprepared and just ended up running a hack and slash werewolf dungeon crawl. We all agreed afterward that it was not only the most fun but the <i>only</i> fun we'd had with the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267002/#Comment_267002" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T18:54:51+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  6:54PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me, the most insightful/accurate definition of "trad" gaming to come out of all these thousands of threads is the premise "every roleplaying game should be played the same way" and its identification with a certain tradition of roleplaying.<br/><br/>Because it absolutely is the case that for a long time, whether or not every game I played <i>was</i> exactly the same, they all <i>felt</i> very similar and -- more importantly -- I <i>wanted them all to be the same</i>. There was only one way roleplaying should be and everything was in competition to a) define that and b) prove itself the best way to get to that. To me that is the main dividing line between my prior gaming and my indie/post-Forge/whatever gaming. And yes, sure, System Doesn't Matter plays right into that (it is after all <i>why</i> you can play all your games the same way), but really the idea of the One True Roleplaying seems to be a pretty common denominator.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267012">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267012/#Comment_267012" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T19:40:11+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  7:40PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do you differentiate between One True Roleplaying and someone's aesthetic decision that a particular way is their favorite, or at least a sufficiently satisfactory way that they don't feel they should go elsewhere?

I think we all understand internally what the difference is between 'I prefer this way' and 'this way is better' -- so however you differentiate that when it comes to any opinion (like, say, best baseball teams or ingredients in a greek salad or how to cook an omelette) is the same way you'd differentiate it here.<br/><br/>I think there's also an age/maturity tie-in here too; even before I encountered the Forge essays and such, I was slowly (very slowly), labouriously moving in the direction of understanding that it was possibly not such a big deal that other people wanted to roleplay differently than me -- but that was the exception to a general opinion that there really were Right Ways and Wrong Ways of treating roleplaying in general, or particular roleplaying material (say, Changeling.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267025/#Comment_267025" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T21:29:44+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  9:29PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience, there was always more of a <i>Spectrum</i> Of True Roleplaying, rather than just <i>One</i>, but everything outside of that was still The Wrong Way To Do It. Back when the letters column of Dragon magazine was my only exposure to how other people played, I knew that RPGs should be about "story" was good and "roleplaying" was good, while "rollplaying", "hack and slash", "killer DMs" and "Monty Haul" campaigns were bad. But even in those pre-Internet days I knew that some groups had different approaches to their story and roleplaying focused campaigns than others. Some DMs used premade campaigns while others used homebrewed ones. Some groups had strict houserules to avoid metagaming (like "only the DM knows how many hit points your guy has") while others relied on social pressure to keep metagaming (which was universally regarded as bad) in check. <br/><br/>In particular, I remember people writing in to Dragon about how awesome their campaign was because "we played for three whole sessions <i>without rolling a single die</i>" and receiving pretty mixed reactions -- no one said that was the <i>wrong</i> way to play, but plenty of people suggested that while you <i>could</i> play that way, you could still have plenty of combat each session without devolving into the dirty sinner territory of rollplaying and hack and slash.<br/><br/>It wasn't until the early days of the internet (where you didn't have to get your letter past a Dragon magazine editor for other people to hear about how your group played) that I started hearing about what I felt at the time were extreme abuses of AD&amp;D, like eschewing roleplaying altogether and just playing AD&amp;D as a tactical minis game. <i>That's</i> when I first started to hear a lot of You're Doing It Wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mxyzplk" title="mxyzplk"><img alt="mxyzplk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/8e50002a2a2cc7eb2725764e0be5aecf?s=48&amp;d=monsterid&amp;r=PG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mxyzplk">mxyzplk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267029/#Comment_267029" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T22:02:44+00:00" title="April 13, 2010 10:02PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm, it's interesting to me how much the "trad" definition here centers around immersion and roleplaying - to this day in the mostly-trad circles I live in, there's a lot of people who do promote the gamist approach and go "bah" to in character play.  In fact, most of the old terms like roll-playing, munchkin, etc. have fallen out of vogue as the stigma against that style of play has been heavily eroded.<br/><br/>It seems like there's a lot of "indie vs trad" discussion here that's trying real hard not to utter the dreaded "GDS" (or GNS, your choice) terms, but isn't that what we're talking about mostly?  In trad, you mainly have the "roll-playing" (gamist) and "role-playing" (sim, ideally to the point of immersion) approaches but the indie games try more for story/drama creation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267038/#Comment_267038" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T23:11:22+00:00" title="April 13, 2010 11:11PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: marknau</cite>People assemble.

Acting as a "Player", we can talk about metagame stuff, but this is a necessary evil, and too much of it is disruptive. Acting as our Character, we can explore the world and interact with it and each other. Our player knowledge should not intermingle with our character knowledge. Good GMs make their world seem like a real place, and that we have the power to go anywhere and do anything and have a real impact on the world. Bad GMs railroad us through some half-assed story they thought it would be cool to share with a captive audience.</blockquote>\nI'm sticking with this.
