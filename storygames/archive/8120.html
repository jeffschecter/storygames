But in what ways, exactly?<br/><br/>This seems an important point to consider if you're going to play Dogs in another setting. Vincent's examples in the book all suggest to rework the Faith as some set of rules or laws, for instance. But it's not necessarily easy to wrap your head around all that, because, after all, the Dogs really pretty much make their own law and make their own decisions. It seems that their conviction in their own moral authority is key, not a strict adherence to a written set of rules.<br/><br/>So, here's a thought experiment:<br/><br/>Some folks sit down to play a game of Dogs in the Vineyard. Except they don't know anything about Mormonism, and aren't big on religion, but they really like Westerns. So they figure they're gonna play this game, as written... except without all the religious stuff.<br/><br/>In other words, in their game the characters are like traveling Sherriffs, moving around to help out with things and keep the peace, going from town to town. That's their job: they're kind of like policemen. And they have authority roughly equal to that of the Mayor of each town. They say what the law is, making things fair and just wherever they go.<br/><br/>What's going to happen to our hapless thought-experiment gamers? What problems and issues are they going to face?<br/><br/>Is their game likely to crash and burn? Are they going to miss the whole point?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178816/#Comment_178816" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-15T15:41:42+00:00" title="November 15, 2008  3:41PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the important points are:<br/><br/>1 - There are a set of rules/laws people are supposed to follow to be "good people". If you want you can also keep the aspect that dictates that as long as these rules are followed the community is protected from "evil" (in the default setting, the demonic influence). If there is no way to tell who is acting according to the rules and who is (technically) sinning, the game will break.<br/><br/>2 - The protagonists (dogs) have *absolute* and personal authority on the matter at hand. If the people of the community can reasonably appeal to an external and higher authority, the game will break.<br/><br/><br/>3 - There has to be an equivalent to the progression of sin: a small problem that leads to a bigger one, and to a bigger one and so on. If you don't have this you cannot use the clever Town Creation mechanics, and the game will break.<br/><br/>...obviously that's all IMO, and bear in mind that "will break" could simply mean "will produce an experience of play that is wildly different from DitV". It could be good, it could be bad, but in both cases you would not be playing DitV.<br/><br/>Thoughts?

I think determining who is evil and how they should be punished is part of the critical "fruitful void" of the game.  Sure, the GM can have their own ideas about who deserves to be punished, but the players ultimately serve as judges and the game specifically tells the GM not to overrule them or have an overall absolute morality in mind.  It's actually vitally important that it be <i>not entirely clear</i> who is ultimately to blame, whether specific individuals, the steward, the entire messed up society, the demons, the Dogs themselves, or whoever.  Honestly, I've always viewed the Hierarchy of Sin as something the GM uses to create towns, but something that pretty much goes out the window once the Dogs arrive and start laying down their own version of the law.<br/><br/>I think the real purpose of the Faith is for the Dogs to be enforcing a moral code that they themselves (or, at least, their players) don't necessarily agree with or one that, like any real world Faith, is full of its own problematic issues.  This allows the Dogs to struggle with both 1) implementing the law and 2) deciding whether the law, as written, really deserves to be implemented.  That creates all sorts of bloody story meat that the game thrives on, including disagreements among the Dogs about how judgement should be carried out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178833/#Comment_178833" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-15T18:19:48+00:00" title="November 15, 2008  6:19PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the feedback so far.<br/><br/>Filip, that link was very helpful as well, thanks.<br/><br/>So, let me ask you:<br/><br/>Given that your Western attempt fell flat, what is it that makes your ninja bunny princess mod work?

Let's see.<br/><br/>Religion in Dogs is a couple of different things.<br/><br/>* It's a source of a given moral code which most townspeople you'll encounter view to be correct in most of its particulars. (The Dogs may disagree with said moral code)<br/>* It's the source of the moral authority of the Dogs themselves.<br/>* It's the source of a notion of moral causality, which is <i>possibly</i> supernatural fact and <i>possibly</i> just superstition, although <i>either way its just as important because the townsfolk (mostly) believe in it</i>.<br/><br/>If you wanted to replace religion with something, it'd need to fulfil all three of those criteria. So, Jedi work, but I'm not sure sheriffs would - sheriffs would lose the moral causality thing somewhat (it'd be expressed, perhaps, as sociological fact - small crimes lead to bigger ones - but is that something the townsfolk would buy into?), and also the moral authority thing somewhat (because having duly constituted legal authority isn't quite the same thing as moral authority, and generally would mean you'd be cleaving closer to the actual laws of the land rather than what's "right").<br/><br/>So it could sorta work, but it'd probably be a bit weak-tea.<br/><br/>In general, the game is about morality, about being the judge of men's souls. It's not about playing policemen, it's about playing God. So your alternate setting should try and live up to that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178840/#Comment_178840" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-15T19:09:38+00:00" title="November 15, 2008  7:09PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thomas,<br/><br/>Of your bullet points, what makes the first and third important to gameplay?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178884">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178884/#Comment_178884" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-16T06:42:41+00:00" title="November 16, 2008  6:42AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jonathan">@Jonathan</a>: actually I agree. I was just a bit too cryptic I guess. I wrote that there needs to be an "official" rule because people *in the town* need a way to say "the rule says this, but I'll do that instead, because X". At the same time, the "official" rules allow *other* people to envy those who are not following them (or hate them, or despise them). This way the escalation of strife nicely works by itself. That's why I wrote "technically".<br/><br/>If you don't have the equivalent of the faith how can you have the sin ladder, that basically creates the whole Situation of the game?<br/><br/>The Dogs (or equivalents) need to have absolute authority because as you say *that's* the point of the game, I agree.<br/><br/>The three points I enumerated have to exist together, otherwise it will break even worse. For example, as you note, a religion with firm rules (1) and no absolute authority to the players (2) will lead to GM tastes and morals dictating the real rules and the classic "paladin punishment" from the GM.

And it does this for both the townsfolk and the Dogs. You could do this with a secular code of laws, but it would be less powerful - simply because it is a stronger thing to say that God's law is wrong than it is to say the same of the laws of man.<br/><br/>The moral causality is crucial because it underpins the logic of town creation. If you used the town creation rules as they were but took the religion away, then the narrative logic of the town would be undermined. (Note that this is true whether the demons' existence is an objective fact or just a subjective superstition).<br/><br/>I could talk at greater length about this, but I'll stop there for the moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178975/#Comment_178975" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-17T09:09:56+00:00" title="November 17, 2008  9:09AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I run Dogs, I try to explain a couple things to the players before we jump in:<br/><br/>1) The Dogs are just teen-aged virgins with guns and the absolute authority to judge sinners.

Here we go:<br/><br/><b>The King's Laws</b><br/>The Law of the King comes before any religion, or other law.<br/>Treason against the King is the worst of crimes.<br/>A Lord's army is the King's army, first and foremost.<br/><br/><b>Lord's Laws</b><br/>Except as he is a Lord, the Lord is a subject.<br/>Second only to the King's Laws, a Lord's Laws are his own.<br/>A Lord is the enforcer of the Kings Laws and of his own.<br/>The Kings' Roads are the Lord's to maintain, in the Lord's lands.<br/>The Lord must ensure that there is a safe place for travelers to rest, which must charge only what is reasonable for travellers to pay. <br/> <br/><b>Magician's Laws</b><br/>Except as he is a magician, the magician is a subject.<br/>Using magic to summon dark powers from outside this world is punishable by death.<br/>Using magic to harm another is punishable in kind, threefold. <br/>A magician is expected to use his light arts for the betterment of the citizens.<br/><br/><b>Subject's Laws</b><br/>Murder is punishable by death.<br/>In return for the King's protection, all must pay taxes on profits to the King.<br/>Parents are responsible for their children's well-being. <br/><br/><b>Traditions with no force of law</b><br/>Travel on the King's Road should be free.<br/>If a person is hungry and without means, the Inn should provide food from the left-overs.<br/>All persons with no work should be offered a job by the Lord.<br/>On Lord's day, the Lord will go about in disguise, and grant a boon to anyone who asks.<br/>A God outside his home is a guest at best.<br/><br/><b>The Ladder of Rebellion</b><br/>This is the King's Marshall analog of towns falling apart.<br/>PRIDE -&gt;  Crimes<br/>INJUSTICE -&gt; Injustice ..(in the context of politics rather than morality: taxes set too high, not maintaining the roads, whatever--all those "little laws" are just niggling color that you use to hammer the Crimes below.)<br/>SINS -&gt; Crimes ...against the Kings Law.<br/>"DEMONIC" ATTACKS (things going wrong because of seditious influences)<br/>FALSE DOCTRINE -&gt; Unlawful Declarations ...Actually asserting that the "right" law is NOT the Kings Law.<br/>CORRUPT WORSHIP -&gt; Sedition ...Spreading democratic of nationalistic ideals; enforcing Lords Laws in violation of the Kings Law.<br/>FALSE PRIESTHOOD -&gt; A demagogue arises. Rebellion ...Actively disregarding the Kings Law, be it secretly or openly; drawing neighboring Fiefs into your Sedition.<br/>SORCERY -&gt; Treason<br/>HATE AND MURDER - Secession ...Forming one's own Kingdom within the real Kingdom.<br/><br/><b>Magic</b><br/>Magic is handled as follows. When a magician is created, the player takes up to 8 dice from stat dice to create d8 magical traits (usually just a spell). Any "take the blow roll" which includes magical d8s is treated as one category worse for fallout (d10 max) (magic is dangerous). Magical conflicts have been enjoyable, and magicians always seem to risk using them, due to their relatively puny reduced stats. Any defining an item as magic takes this risk, but certain things can only be affected by magic. The priest got to choose his own ceremonies, appropriate for his beliefs. There is ripe ground for conflict between the religious beliefs and the King's Law.<br/><br/>I've got some actual play somewhere.

In DitV terms, this would be a difficult town, or it wouldn't have made much of a D&amp;D adventure. There were two players who had not played DitV before, one of whom had not really played any indie games at all. One player (Steve) is experienced with the game. I'd never GM'ed it before, and I'm like a sieve when it comes to rules, but it didn't matter too much. The setup took a while with six players, and we skipped a startup conflict, leaving it open, because the player couldn't make a decision.<br/><br/>To start with, people were ignoring potential conflicts. It took a while for them to get riled up, but then it worked really well. The important thing was to give all the NPCs realistic motives to bend the law, which introduced the moral ambiguity necessary to make the PCs choices interesting. The conflicts between the religious views of the population (and within the Dogs themselves) were fertile. Magic worked unproblematically.<br/><br/>The main conflicts revolved around an religious orphanage which was allowing parents to ignore their responsibilities, and a Magician, a Seer, who was instructing a weak Lord using a scrying device which made predictions (think PK Dick's story Minority Report). The Lord's men prearrested people to stop them committing crimes. The Orcs (mountain men equivalents) had been cattle raiding - just an occasional one here and there, but the scrying glass meant the Lord's men knew where they would be and this escalated. There was a great conflict over whether an orc child was innately evil and non-human, or could be brought up as a human child. Somehow, Steve's character (the priest) managed to get away with his unpleasant interpretation, in the face of half-hearted opposition.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23372.0" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is the actual play thread for the first session (the least good one), and <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23307.0" rel="nofollow">here</a> is the original setting discussion.

The characters must be the primary source of authority. If they (or others) can appeal to something else... we go nowhere.<br/><br/>2. The real hinge of the "moral authority" thing is the responsibility that comes with it. It's important to realize that you're the moral authority in the situation. More importantly, that means you bear the moral responsibility for what happens and how it goes.<br/><br/>Joshua, what you're saying about the Texas Rangers is kind of like what I was suggesting in the OP. (Although I'm not familiar with Texas Rangers, so tell me if I'm wrong.)<br/><br/>So, I guess my question really boils down to:<br/><br/>Is having power enough? Will Dogs play work as well if the players are the only ones with the power to change the way things are, and everyone is expecting them to do so, asking them for help?<br/><br/>For instance:<br/><br/>* The Dogs are the only form of law enforcement.<br/>* The Dogs are the only ones who have guns.<br/><br/>What's missing in this kind of setup? I guess the players need to buy in to the concept that their characters have agreed to carry this responsibility--that if they give it up and want to leave the town, they are willing to leave play and retire their character. I think that Filip's magical bunny princess thing and Clinton's Princes' Kingdom both accomplish this implicitly.<br/><br/>The Dogs setup does this, and a whole lot more, in a really clear, straightforward way that's hard to mess with without messing it up. The Sin ladder, Town creation, escalation rules, etc, all work together in a very tightly integrated way.<br/><br/>Still, it's interesting to push the boundaries. Where does the Texas Rangers concept go wrong, if anywhere?                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179340/#Comment_179340" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-19T12:25:50+00:00" title="November 19, 2008 12:25PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: warren</cite>(Jumping back to "what do you tell your players about the setting" question for a moment)<br/>I have come up with this<a href="http://wmerrifield.googlepages.com/DogsOneSheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">one-sheet PDF introduction</a>that explains what the Faith is, and a short bit on Coats, authority the Faith and demons.
