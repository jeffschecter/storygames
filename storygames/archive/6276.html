And after a bit of talking and a nice game of "Show and Tell", I got him to stock a couple of IPRs indie games, amongst them PtA, Reign and Roanoke! ^_^<br/><br/>After my original plan (demo a couple of games at the local convention to spread the word and get him to stock them) failed because of a "Monsters..." game and my resulting lack of voice (Curse my overacting. And Dr. Stein.), I had thought it would be harder. But he seemed really interested and open to try it and seemed to become even more so the more he thought about it.<br/><br/>So once he ordered a couple of games, I'll write the blurbs for his website and in a couple of weeks, the first Indies should go over the counter.

So they don't carry my game. <br/><br/>But everyone else in town (Hobby Masters, Foundation's Edge, Fallen Orc Games, and All Fun &amp; Games) was cool with the idea, and you can usually find a copy at one of those places (except Fallen Orc, because they're out of business -- or maybe they've moved locations, and I just don't know where they've gone to).<br/><br/>The first edition of Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium was released in 2002, before the advent of Lulu. I had 100 copies printed up for about fifteen dollars a book. I'd sell them to the store for $20 apiece, and the store owner would sell them for $30. It usually sold out pretty quickly. I only sold a few copies this way -- most of my sales were direct, where people would paypal me and I'd put the book in a padded envelope and mail it to them.<br/><br/>These days, I print Dread up at Lulu for about 11 bucks. Add a few dollars for shipping, so that's, say, fourteen dollars a book. I take it to game store X, where they buy a copy from me for $20. They sell it for cover price -- $25 -- and so I make six dollars, store guy makes five. Sell enough copies, it adds up enough to justify the time and energy. Again, however, this only accounts for a small percentage of my sales -- most of my sales are online, via Lulu.<br/><br/>My sales pitch is pretty straightforward. I give the store guy a copy of my book, along with a one-page information doc. It lists the name of the book, and a one-paragraph summary (no jargon, you story/indie people -- just give them the plain-English version of what the game's setting and mechanics are like). Under that, a bulleted list of features (presumably, the same ones you've got on your web site).<br/><br/>The rest of the page consists of quotes from reviews, with proper citation (name of reviewer, name of site/publication, date). At the bottom, my URL in big bold letters.<br/><br/>This approach, combined with a direct and friendly sales pitch (when the store is pretty much empty and the store owner can give me her/his undivided attention), tends to seal the deal. Since this is the second time I'm doing this, I can draw on sales figures from the first edition of Dread to support my assertion that the game will, in fact, sell.<br/><br/>-- Rafael                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139491/#Comment_139491" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-13T08:59:47+00:00" title="April 13, 2008  8:59AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;The manager at Goblin Books told me that if I didn't have the confidence to publish my game by the thousands, and distribute it through traditional channels, then he didn't have the confidence to sell it in his store.

I'm wondering: Did you ask after Trail of Cthulhu? Cause Harry mentioned that somebody had asked about Indies and ToC a bit ago and I wouldn't be surprised if the fact that two people asked for it made up his mind a bit. But then after the last con, maybe he was just looking for change in general. *shrug*\n<blockquote>Now interesting is that a year or two back also another store - the Spielerei - used to have copies of Sorcerer and its companion books for sale (although terribly overpriced), the German translation of InSpectres and Little Fears, and a couple of other non-mainstream games as well.</blockquote>True, I remember. Sadly, I think those were "Lucky Hits" as even when I had more contact with the Spielerei there didn't seem to be a willingness to try out things outside of the mainstream. Or at least not much. And now, with the changed owners, even that willingness seems to have disappeared, from what I can tell. (At least looking at their stock.) But I don't know, I don't really go there anymore, so somebody else would have to approach them.\n<blockquote>So I wonder if you could build on these foundations?</blockquote>To get the Spielerei to stock Indies? That job I leave for somebody else to tackle, though I'd imagine, should these things sell for Harry, that other shops would start stocking them too.<br/><br/>But all in all, I think the next couple of years will be interesting, with the change in con structure, the introduction of indie games into the shops and so on.

According to the guy at the store, it's being held in their warehouse upstate. As far as table space, most of the store is packed with books. I'm curious as to which store you're talking about, because I'm talking about Compleat Strategist. <br/><br/>This was a manager/co-owner. Basically, I asked a clerk whether they had the game in the store because I hadn't seen it and he couldn't find it. Then the manager got all huffy when I pulled out the promotional postcards and was like "We don't carry all of the books on our website in the store. Some of them are just in the warehouse." Which is when I told him I'd be happy to do the promotional thing if he wanted and he took the cards and was like; "Fine, whatever." The store's been in business forever, so they must have SOME business sense, which is why this just seemed weird to me. It seems like a no-lose situation. It's not like I was asking for them to pay me. <br/>The manager seemed upset that I was asking about my book at all or taking his time by suggesting I could do an event with them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139801/#Comment_139801" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-15T12:52:54+00:00" title="April 15, 2008 12:52PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, different store.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the second part of my post remains valid. Lots of stores don't like to run in store promotions or events for RPGs because they feel it doesn't generate the same kind of return as running events for ccgs or clickies or miniatures games. They don't even like to run events for D&amp;D, which is infinitly more ably to be merchandised to capitalize on new interests such events can generate, as opposed to any other RPG line, much less a stand alone indie game.<br/>\n<br/>\nYet some stores do stock and sell the RPGs and Indie games because they see the demand and don't want to let those sales go.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf, course, they do have a unique conflict of interest when trying to compare RPG promotion to like promotions for other product categories. And this seems to be a point of contention that many stores have to get past, or they are going to see RPGs continue to diminish as a product category in their store till the point that the stores stop carrying them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

By 'played a trick', I mean that in his mind, you acted like you wanted to buy product when you were actually testing him to see if he really stocked your game.  That's not what you were actually doing, but I'd bet money that was how he perceived it.<br/><br/>It might not hurt to go back and try again, preferably with a different manager.

I used to work at their Falls Church store in NOVA, man these guys have some odd business ideas. Like, no computer inventory system. You have to do everything by hand written receipts. Which is a pain during annual inventory (try digging through a year of receipts that fills up 3 boxes) plus, any game they don't like personally they stop carrying. Kenzer Co had that problem with them. Once they were a huge seller then the owner got upset at Dave Kenzer and told everyone that they couldnt get the game because Kenzer Co had gone out of buisness. Which was ridiculous because other stores were getting their stuff all the time. Course that last part is just hearsay from 3 successive managers. <br/>\nIve been to CS in New York like 3 times (its right by the Empire State BDG.) and if youve never been you should just because its like a gaming museum packed with supplements of games that havent sold, and will never sell because now the game company has been out of business for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nHey they had first editions of the world of Synnibar.... <br/>\n<br/>\nIn some ways I love that they're still around and in others... man I cant believe it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145935/#Comment_145935" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-25T10:16:58+00:00" title="May 25, 2008 10:16AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145938/#Comment_145938" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-25T10:47:59+00:00" title="May 25, 2008 10:47AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're welcome. ^_^<br/><br/>M, who feels his belly thoroughly rubbed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145939/#Comment_145939" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-25T11:46:03+00:00" title="May 25, 2008 11:46AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've had pretty good luck with the Compleat Strategist. They sponsor our RPG gaming club with 10% discount cards (after a minimum purchase) and allow us to put up fliers and posters for all our events. And upon request they have carried several indie RPGs including Burning Wheel, Lacuna, InSpectres, and more. There are definite aspects of their store that could use improvement like clearing out their huge army of old stock (which also makes the store feel like an RPG museum which is pretty cool). We always try to call them first before dropping by. I would definitely give them another try.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145942/#Comment_145942" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-25T12:36:54+00:00" title="May 25, 2008 12:36PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2008 12:37PM by James_Nostack.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FWIW, this one time I went into Complete Strategist, and was like, "I'd like to buy some ten-sided dice, please."  They have a huge wall of dice behind the cashier.]  But the guy looked at me like I proposed sodomizing his dog.  Once he deigned to understand what I was asking for, he gestured at the wall in a surly and sarcastic fashion, and when I grabbed a tube he acted like he was doing me a huge favor by ringing it up with his stupid little written-receipt book.  It was altogether too much drama for a $4 transaction.  So, yeah, if they were hostile about running a demo, it's because some of the people there are psycho.  Don't let it get you down.<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, the dudes at Neutral Ground - the place Ryan was talking about - have been pretty nice to us.  The one dude <i>wouldn't stop talking to us</i> about upcoming shifts in the gaming industry.  Which, y'know, is cool, but we're burning daylight, man, and we're here to get our dungeon on!  Still, I'd rather have too much friendliness than too little.  I've never tried to make a pitch for "indie" games at Neutral Ground, in part because their shelf space is so limited.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
