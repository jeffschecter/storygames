We did it this weekend and it was all kinds of awesome. We played a Sharpe-based homebrew, some very special D&amp;D;, our first (but definitely not last) game of SOTC and a 'sweeps week' episode of our ongoing Pendragon campaign. It was great.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we were KNACKERED!! Really really really tired.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow we ate properly. We had lots of soft drinks and fruit. We ate regular meals. Yes, we had some alcohol but none of us drank to excess. We put it down to an intensity of concentration on the games - like being in a meeting for ten hours at a time. (I might notice that we age from 29-37, you know, getting on abit...&lt;g&gt;)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat stuck us is that this was only two days of gaming. Three of us are crossing the Atlantic to come to GenCon this year!! How the hell are we going to survive four days of non-stop gaming after a transatlantic flight?!?!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, does anyone have any methods or experiences in getting yourself ready for that side of things? Or is it just one of those things where if you cannot get buzzed for GenCon you shouldn't be a gamer!?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance<br/>\nNeil                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70891/#Comment_70891" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T13:36:20+00:00" title="May 21, 2007  1:36PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you tried vitamins?

But I find that, tempting though a pint with/after/before lunch is, it's a really fucking bad idea if I have any plans after about 10pm.  At Conception this year I enforced it by deciding to run a game every evening in the 7pm slot.  That way, I could just tell anyone who offered to buy me a pint before 6 that I couldn't drink, because I was running a game later and I needed to be on my A Game.<br/><br/>All the advice on drinking water etc is very sound.<br/><br/>Caffeine is the kind of friend who seems like a great guy to hang out with late at night, but actually just keeps you from getting to sleep.<br/><br/>The main thing for me is to know my limits.  I know that, no matter what I do, I need a decent 7 or 8 hours sleep to function.  Gaming for 12 hours a day is a killer, so at a Con I usually try to aim for 2 of the 4 hour slots per day.  I also know that no matter what I do, I'm going to end up playing the Jungle Speed drinking game with tequila or fucking Jaegermeister until very late in the night.  So for me, any morning games are a waste of time, I'm better off getting 4 hours more sleep.  You might decide that you're more of a morning person and want to skip late games.<br/><br/>Eat properly.  That means not just chips.  A good breakfast is worth a dozen crappy burgers later.<br/><br/>Take a shower.  Not only does that make me not smell like homeless guy, but it also wakes me up a lot.<br/><br/>I give myself another day off after the con to recover.  You can drive yourself a bit harder if you know there's some downtime available at the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frank" title="Frank"><img alt="Frank" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Frank">Frank</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71077/#Comment_71077" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T10:08:49+00:00" title="May 22, 2007 10:08AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            man, swimming in the morning is such a good suggestion. and not staying in spookytown makes this possible!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71091/#Comment_71091" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T10:40:44+00:00" title="May 22, 2007 10:40AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stay outta my pool, Frank!

But don't forget what Andrew said above. Basically I don't know anyone who isn't wiped out by GenCon. Oh, they may not be falling over, but I'll bet even Jason wasn't in tip top condition Sunday afternoon. You can mitigate the effects, but I don't know that you can overcome them.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven when I was 18 it wiped me out. I can't recall ever getting out of GenCon in about 20 times I've gone without being messed up by it. I get laryngitis about 75% of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wargmers have a term for how you feel on Sunday afternoon (or sometimes earlier), or rather a behavior that they note in other gamers, "The Thousand Hex Stare." If you get the reference.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, take steps to combat fatigue. But don't expect to win. You're going to an event where there is more gaming goodness going on than you could probably fit in one year if you went to all of the events you wanted to attend (this is not hyperbole). You'll have to pick only a very few of these that you most want to go to, the things that you absolutely have to see and do. You will be tempted to do more than you can.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut even if you somehow manage do only a reasonable amount, joy takes it's toll. You'll cram more fun (and massive dissapointment at times) into those 100 hours than you might in several weeks at home. If that doesn't have an effect on you, you're very different than everybody I know.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can't let this slow you down to a crawl, either, you have to get in what you can manage while you're there - I think it's foolish not to in an attempt to retain full sanity. Just be prepared at the end to deal with being akin to dead the following Monday. Oh, your brain will still be going a mile a minute, perhaps, trying to deal with all you've taken in. But in an uncontrolled fashion that takes sleep and such to right. You'll just have to deal with that if you're going to GenCon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least that's my experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow" title="Neil Gow"><img alt="Neil Gow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/084/nS7S5AMIXMIH0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil%20Gow">Neil Gow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71288/#Comment_71288" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-23T05:33:13+00:00" title="May 23, 2007  5:33AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sound advice - winding down and assimilating what has happened does take some time.

That meant no games that started after midnight.  I also made sure that I didn't register for any games before 8am because no matter how tired you are, your body is most likely still wired and thus you can't fall asleep at first so making sure I was in bed by 1am at the -latest- would ensure I would be asleep by 1:30 or 2am easily.  <br><br>I also drank an amazing amount of Coke and Mt. Dew (I'm sure that didn't hurt anything) but I also drank a lot of water   (actually, I carried a bottle of water with me everywhere I went) and kept a bag full of snacks including Slim Jims, Teddy Grahams and Welch's Fruit Snacks.  There were a quick little energy boost when I needed one. <br><br>Also, have breakfast.  Seriously.  And I don't mean a bagel and coffee. I mean a real breakfast.  The coupons they give you in your goodie bag have some awesome deals at the restaurants in the food court of the mall.  One of them had a great two egg breakfast that would have me stuffed well until lunch time.  <br><br>Oh and the biggest bit of advice I can give... grab one of those lockers!  Before you get your badge if you have to!
