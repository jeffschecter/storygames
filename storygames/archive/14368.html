During lunch most likely, or perhaps after work, but still at the workplace?<br/><br/>If the answer is yes, how did you get the group together? What do they do? <br/><br/>Where do you play and for how long? Do your other co-workers see it going on (and have any of them been curious and maybe wanted in)?<br/><br/>What games and why? And how do you handle what is likely a very short session and maximize the time spent?<br/><br/>And if you haven't done it, why not? No other gamers around? No place to play? Frowned on by the boss?<br/><br/>My answers:<br/><br/>I'm currently running a lunchtime game of Legends of Anglerre. This is the first time I have gamed at work. I have gamed with co-workers before, but always after hours and not at the office. We play on Fridays from noon to about 1 before everyone heads back to their desks and eat lunch while we're playing. We have a pretty nice lunchroom with a big lounge and several tables that are perfect for gaming on (about 6' x 4', seat about 6). Anyone walking by or eating lunch there can see us, and indeed a few have been curious and expressed interest (I work at a geek company so most people there aren't so weirded out about it). <br/><br/>I got the group together after I realized there were several gamers in the office. I've pretty much got our entire Online team (4 players), the IT dept manager, and one person from Marketing. Four men, two women. Three of those Online guys are active gamers with their own groups. The other woman from Online and the IT mgr haven't played any RPGs since high school, and the woman from Marketing pretty much never played anything at all.<br/><br/>I chose LoA/FATE because it's fast and easy and I love aspects. The group wanted to do a steampunk/fantasy game and we did the floating islands and airships thing. Given that I work for a manga and anime publisher, it's no surprise the game is influenced by such titles as Nausicaa, Laputa, One Piece (and in a left field sort of way, Toriko). Given the backgrounds of the players, I wondered if it would work but it has. The vets help the newbies and they all seem to enjoy the game itself - FATE's floating everyone's boat so far.<br/><br/>Since we only have an hour, I just go straight for the action, and bang on those character aspects and backgrounds hard. I've gotten into a rhythm of two sessions of action and then one session to cool down before I ramp it up. I try to end each session on a cliffhanger. I don't do much prep beyond thinking about what character to shine the spotlight on next and jotting down some notes on what NPCs to use. I'm enjoying flying this one by the seat of my pants, and the players think I'm doing more prep than I'm actually doing.<br/><br/>We've only just started about a month ago, but it's gone really well - players that have missed a session (for whatever reason) are bummed that they missed it.  I'm looking forward to more!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326437/#Comment_326437" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-26T05:47:33+00:00" title="May 26, 2011  5:47AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds amazing!

So far it's worked out. Absent player's characters get NPC'd and it's becoming something of a tradition that something bad (and humorous) happens to you when you're gone.<br/><br/>The biggest challenge for me is pacing a one hour game for appropriate stopping points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326594/#Comment_326594" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-26T21:06:11+00:00" title="May 26, 2011  9:06PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't, but my friend who works at Red Hat does.

Since the OP was interested in the reasons for such things, I'll provide a couple: <br/><br/>1) Not many of my coworkers are gamers. I know of only one, and he's pretty much of the "There's games other than D&amp;D?" kind.<br/>2) Our breaks are a half-hour in length. Not a whole lot of time, especially if you plan to actually use some of it to hit the cafeteria so you can actually eat.<br/>3) We're not given any personal space or lockers or such in my department, so we can't exactly carry gaming books around. Even character sheets would have to be folded up several times and hidden in pockets, which is murder on those poor bastards if you've got anything else in there, given the amount of walking entailed by the job.<br/>4) Not everyone gets the same breaks, and you don't know in advance which break you're going to get, which means arranging even two people to game at all regularly would be a crap shoot, and more than that would mean possibly all having the same break once or twice a month, and that's assuming all your breaks happened on time instead of a bit early or late, either of which happening would give you even less than the abovementioned half-hour.<br/><br/>(I work in security, at a casino, for the record)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
