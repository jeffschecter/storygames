Because each player has only been there for at best 75% of the sessions (except me, I've gotten 11 out of 12), there's a timidity around things like what color the cobblestones are, whether it's raining, how people dress, and so on.  That has lead to ... more often than not ... those elements getting missed.<br/><br/>I know we could sit down and world build, but it's so easy for that to be a waste of time or just plain un-fun.  <br/><br/>How can we get over the descriptive hump, and get a more solid baseline to play with?  This is especially crucial because we're all getting together on Labour day to play another chapter and do this kind of stuff... but I realized it will go so much better if I structure it.<br/><br/>How can this be fun and successful?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165613/#Comment_165613" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T06:46:19+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  6:46AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, how much descriptive stuff do you narrate in play?

People might, at best, be emboldened to screw around with that person's contributions, but it sounds like people are uncertain of the importance that the other 10 players put on their contributions and don't want to inadvertently (or intentionally) destroy something someone else really has invested in.  In other words, it's a social issue, not a game issue, and can only be solved at the social level, either convincing people that it's okay to destroy what each other has created in your blind flailing spasms (the dictionary calls it "creativity"), or, as I suspect it might be with such a large group, establishing that it isn't okay, and that the pussyfooting, as you call it, is actually tact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165782/#Comment_165782" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T13:45:04+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  1:45PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, good point, Ryan.

Its like a rule...so not doing it is actually breaking the rules.  So I think step one is just to make sure the GM enforces this rule with a hard draconian fist, at least until people get into the habit of doing it without the whip.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second part of the problem, however, is recording the details in a format that people who weren't there can benefit from.  For this you may find it helpful to treat people, locations, cultures, etc, like Universalis Components.  Create an index card for each thing that crops up during play and appoint one of the players to be "keeper of that thing" for the session.  Whenever a detail is expressed (which should be frequently if the GM is cracking the whip) that detail gets recorded on the appropriate card.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen future stories revisit existing locations its a simple manner to whip out the appropriate cards, read off the existing details to get everyone in the right frame of mind, and go.<br/>\n<br/>\nCombine with the Wiki and pictures idea above for even more impact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165824/#Comment_165824" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T16:51:00+00:00" title="August 27, 2008  4:51PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, have you considered making an audio recording and podcasting them?

Playing in the past needs so more explanation so people don't expect characters X, Y, and Z to die.<br>3)  I'm getting faster at explaining the rules, but 12 sessions with brand-new players in almost every one really does hinder the development of techniques at the table.  That's a lot of time spent teaching the game, which also has clouded the details.<br/>4)  The thing that went most wrong at the game was the loss of the detail at the end of a conflict.  Towards 10:00 we were all getting tired and the descriptions started to wane.  Two scenes were happening at the same time, one on the roof of a temple and one inside.  The guys on the roof were fighting to the death and unfortunately started limiting conesequences to the mechanical in their duel... so the fight just dragged on and on and on without the situation developing.  I call this "failing to take your victory." and I might going to have to enforce "winner describes damage to loser" so we can get it right.  To me this is just another failure to apply the detail rule from the text.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165922/#Comment_165922" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T09:26:35+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  9:26AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Lucas</cite>No one was willing to budge because no one wanted to lose face.

He also was bummed about getting his ass handed to him repeatedly... which was nobody's fault but that doesn't mean it was fun for him.
