They're going to find it. So ask yourself: Where's the conflict in this situation? Why are we spending time focusing on this moment? Are there guards wandering the grounds or a deadly monster lurking? Is there a vicious trap?<br/><br/>When a player fails a search roll, or any roll really, the answer doesn't have to be a brick wall ("no sorry, you don't find anything"). You can throw in a complication instead. The characters find the ledger just as the crime bosses' goons burst through the door, pulls the mouldering tome from under a pile of junk as the giant spiders descend from the ceiling silently on silken threads, or notice the killer trap just as they're about to pull the ancient scroll from its case.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nThanks Thor for posting this, because it sheds some light on the conflict vs task resolution discussion, which I've never been able to piece together.  <br/><br/>So here are the necessary questions in my mind:<br/><br/>1) So it seems like there is a "game of imagination" happening. One in which the GM tries to create interesting conflicts restricted to solutions that involve task resolving abilities that player characters possess.  Is this part of the appeal?  It seems to me like maybe I would enjoy this in PREP, but that I might feel pressure trying to do it well at the TABLE in real time.<br/><br/>2) Has it ever been demonstrated that particular character "skills", "abilities", etc are easier than others to work into conflict resolution?  I don't know if any games were designed with CR in mind; all I've heard of are games that use task resolution and then folks have rewired them to include conflict resolution (Thor's example above would be the latter case, I believe). If the question isn't clear, I mean for example: skill at public speaking, versus skill at firearms, versus skill at research, etc<br/><br/>3) It also seems like conflict isn't actually a total replacement for task resolution, but is a good replacement when a task resolution has no inherent dramatic weight (I think a lot of games traditionally use the rule, 'use our task resolution mechanics when chance of failure for the character is logically present in the fiction' which in hindsight seems to be a poorly thought out criteria). Is this how you guys have used conflict resolution?<br/><br/>Okay, thanks for any thoughts about this.  This goes back to my last (mostly unsuccessful) game of D&amp;D 4e, where at first glance I thought the skill challenge system was D&amp;D's way of incorporating conflict resolution, but then it all fell apart on me when I tried to use it -- really I think because of my lack of understanding conflict resolution anyway.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268995/#Comment_268995" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T12:41:54+00:00" title="April 26, 2010 12:41PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/>\n  1) Well, that is one aspect. Another element is attempting overcome "roll until you fail" issues as well. Also, it puts a damper on "random" encounters, because most Conflict systems require you to sort of state what the whole fight is about. Which, as it turns out, is a great way to establish and maintain great communication between the GM and players.<br/>\n  2) Not really, in fact, because most conflict systems are universal, any skill is applicable, if you can explain where the conflict is (maybe you have a conflict that uses Baking skill in a contest for reputation as a good chef).<br/>\n   3) I dunno. Task Resolution seems to focus on "can you accomplish the task?" It doesn't really touch on "why you are doing the task?" Most Conflict systems focus on "why are using a particular skill?" A great example I saw was "getting to a boat before it leaves the pier". In both systems, you have to fight some goons on the dock to get to the boat. but, in Task Systems, you roll to see if you can hit the goons. If you win or lose, it says nothing about if you make it to the boat in time. In Conflict Systems, you are rolling to see if you can make it to the boat on time and the relevance of the fight is given its due weight in the description of how it happened ()if it is a critical battle, it gets more weight than if the goons are just an obstacle). In both cases, you might be rolling athletics skills to see if you can run fast enough or a melee skill to fight the ruffians. But the reason you are rolling and the interpretation of the outcome is totally different.<br/>\n  Does that help at all?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269004/#Comment_269004" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T13:41:43+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  1:41PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>Conflict resolution as a term gets used in many different ways, so it is helpful to remember that at the core of things you actually have a conflict, a clash of important goals in the fiction, and its resolution, the social or mechanical process by which we all discover how the conflict turns out. <br/><br/>This means that what makes it a conflict rather than just any situation is the awareness of the goals in tension. Take a look at 4E D&amp;Ds combat subsystem - this is another example of conflict resolution in terms of your goal of defeating your enemies in the fight, because at the top level of combat you have everything you need to translate the task actions of attacking and moving into that ultimate outcome. But D&amp;D lacks (although the skill challenge system was an attempt to patch this to some extent) a general purpose conflict resolution mechanic. Meaning that if a conflict does arise outside of the regime of its conflict resolution the group is faced with the prospect of letting it be handled through purely social means - often GM fiat*. <br/><br/>Now more designed forms of conflict resolution often involve explicitly negotiating the goals of the conflict in question. This can be incredibly helpful, because the negotiation airs assumptions about what the group members want and where things are headed. Then the goals are set, and the conflict is resolved, quickly (analogous to the simple skill roll) or through involved back and forth (more analogous to a combat encounter), depending on the system. Often a complex process informs and fleshes out the pre-determined goals, adding new twists or consequences to the situation. Finally the selected goal becomes the outcome of the conflict. <br/><br/>This negotiation is very important to general conflict resolution. Here you, the group come to a consensus that the outcomes in question will all be acceptable and interesting. Here, for example, is when you as a GM should recognize when that simple failure (even with additional problems) will be uninteresting, so it should be taken off the table as a goal. It is the source of much of its power, and also one of its critical weaknesses as a technique. After the negotiation a great deal of the group's flexibility about the conflict is lost - in a real way the heavy lifting of defining the conflict and experiencing it occurs here, in some sense the resolution can almost be an after thought, even a disappointment.<br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><br/>* Which in my reading makes GM fiat a form of conflict resolution, but others take a narrower view.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

The term "Conflict Resolution" is agnostic on whether tasks are being described in the process. What you care about is, "Am I rolling because I'm taking a risk in some way?" If you're rolling whether or not you're risking something, that's Task Resolution. (Note that "roll" is shorthand here for "in some way make an impactful decision". If you're rolling to see if you pick a lock, and the result is that you'll either open the lock or have to roll again, you're not resolving anything, other than that it took a long time to pick the lock. If you're picking a lock in a hurry because the viscount is about to see you and call the guards, that's another matter. That's resolving a conflict.)</p>\n<p>A favorite old chestnut of an example:</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>I'm the GM. You're a player.</p>\n<p>Me: OK, you've snuck up to the gate. There are two orcs guarding it and drinking a beer.</p>\n<p>You: OK, I throw a rock into the moat to distract them. (Roll, succeed)</p>\n<p>Me: OK, they look down there.</p>\n<p>You: I sneak past the orcs.</p>\n<p>Me: Oh, they're just looking over the side of the drawbridge. You can't sneak by without them seeing you.</p>\n<p>You: (maybe a little miffed)Crap. Um. I'll kill them!</p>\n<p>Me: They come at you all like, "GRRAAH!</p>\n<p>(We roll, you win the fight)</p>\n<p>You: OK, I go through the gate.</p>\n<p>Me: Through the gate? There's a portcullis! You can't just walk through!</p>\n<p>etc.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Please note: in this example, I'm not just being a jerk. We just haven't agreed, as players, what it will take to get you to the other side of the gate. I'm genuinely surprised! I thought you were just worried about them sending the alarm!</p>\n<p>Equally plausible is this:</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>...You:  I throw a rock in the water to distract them. (roll &amp; succeed)</p>\n<p>Me: You did it! You walk in and see the kidnapped prince walking through the courtyard! You take him back to the king and you're rewarded richly!</p>\n<p>You: Oh, um, OK... that wasn't very satisfying.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>In this case, I wanted to not be a jerk so bad, I made stupid shit happen. This knife cuts both ways.</p>\n<p>Now, imagine a set of rules that says that getting through the gate is a difficulty 10 challenge. That means I get 10 dice of stuff to throw at you. Some of it is orcs, some of it is drawbridge, some of it is portcullis. And let's say that, whenever I roll a 6 on my dice, I get one die back, so you don't know exactly how many dice I'll have going into the challenge; you only know approximately. Or maybe every 6 I get is instead long-term consequences for you \u2014\xa0wounds, imprisonment, theft or destruction of your weapons and armor (it costs me more to take away more valuable stuff), or whatever; that way, you don't  know what it will cost you to get what you want.</p>\n<p>So you let me know \u2014\xa0maybe just by planning with the other players in character, out-loud, or maybe by stating it directly, that you're trying to get into the castle. You and I know what the risks and rewards are, so we can play a) fair, and b) hard. I can give you fit opposition without being a jerk and you can come up with clever solutions and bold moves, knowing that they're going toward an effect.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

It removes the need for negotiation because the people responsible for "speaking" for a given fictional entity have full authority over it.  No one can say what my character does and intends to accomplish but me.  And no one can say what your character does and intends but you.  So we just say what they say and do and when there's a conflict (i.e. we are attempting to interfere with each others attempts to do) then we roll.  Therefore, you only need to know what the characters are *doing* and the dice resolve the conflict between those actions.  Thus conflict can work at any scale from, "I hit you with a crowbar" vs "I sweep kick you to the ground" to "My air strike blows up your castle" vs. "My ground forces take the river."<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269013/#Comment_269013" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T14:29:05+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  2:29PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2010 8:34PM by Todd_L.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Big J Money</cite><br/>2) Has it ever been demonstrated that particular character "skills", "abilities", etc are easier than others to work into conflict resolution?</blockquote>\nYes.<br/><br/><b>Luck</b><br/>A character with low stats in Intelligence, Dexterity, and Archery might constantly fail to accomplish things the usual way; but if he has high Luck-- then even-though his arrows miss their targets/ his enemies might be shocked to find that the stray arrows trigger a chain reaction involving a church bell, a startled cow, a stampede, and a victory for Mr. Lucky.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.idiom.com/~trip/tmp/elfs.html" rel="nofollow">Elfs</a> does this by having the player state what she wants, and (seperately) what her character wants; and rolling to see which happens.

One seriously bad conflict resolution experience I've had occured in a game that matches your description because my "opponent" had stated his intentions and I stated mine but we hadn't been careful enough to make sure that each other understood them. I lost, conserving my resources, only to discover that his goal was far more severe than I had been led to believe. Which led to a deprotagonization double whammy - getting bait and switched into accepting an intent I (and the character) would have fought tooth and nail against and essentially being locked out of participating for much of the rest of the story. <br/><br/>   - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

The non-stick-haver can always opt to take a hit (which is pretty serious, mechanically) instead of taking what the stick-haver wants. The stick-haver usually doesn't care, of course, what the non-stick-haver's stats are, so will usually adjust to make the negotiation more amenable to the non-stick-haver. But at any point, the non-stick-haver can basically say, "No, I'll take the black eye. I'm not giving you what you want." This is a coercive method, where everyone <em>doesn't</em> need to agree beforehand.</p>\n<p>Note the way Shock:s stakes work, by the way. I, as a Protagonist, say what I want. You, as the Antagonist, offer something that I might want more (or might not want more). That makes me divide my resources, and since I never know exactly what my resources are (since they're dice), it makes it a really hard choice. And sometimes neither, sometimes either, and sometimes both of us get what we want. This is very similar to what Ron's talking about there, but I don't think he ever implemented it in such a way that orthogonal objectives can be addressed (someone correct me if I'm wrong). This method is focused around asking for something, then giving someone else the opportunity to twist it (which can happen at a couple of other points in resolution).</p>\n<p>Polaris has opposing players state stakes back and forth at each other until one of them says, "You ask far too much." Then you roll to determine the final outcome, including long-term effects on the character. Again, they're not really stated "beforehand" because they're the meat of the resolution system itself.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269072/#Comment_269072" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T21:36:32+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  9:36PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Folks try to make conflict resolution all complicated, but it's not really.<br/><br/>All rpgs (or at least the vast majority) have conflict resolution. There is a system (explicit or implicit, principled or ad hoc) for deciding if characters get what they want. That system can be as simple as "yes, they get what they want" or "The GM decides based on what seems cool", or as complex as you like. <br/><br/>All games also have task resolution. That's where you decide how well a character does a thing that they've set out to do. There is a system (explicit or implicit, principled or ad hoc) for deciding if they do well at the task or not.  That system can be as simple as "they do as well as the player says they do" or as complex as you like.<br/><br/>Many games, maybe most that you're familiar with, have explicit, principled task resolution, with complex rules, and then implicit, principled conflict resolution, with simple rules. Usually this looks like "roll some dice to see how well your character succeeds at the task, then the GM will decide if that gets your character what they want, based on what's realistic and what seems cool".  A lot of games that you're familiar with probably have more explicit conflict resolution for killing things, where the rule is "roll some dice to see how well the character hits the enemy, and then roll some dice to see if that kills them".<br/><br/>A common thing is to have conflict resolution rely on task resolution, or vise versa "Roll to see if your character succeeds at what they were doing, and if they're successful, they get what they want" or "Roll to see if your character gets what they want, and if they do, they succeed at doing something (you can say what) to get it".<br/><br/>Some games, maybe ones you're not as familiar with have experimented with explicit conflict resolution for all or most conflicts, alongside or instead of explicit task resolution. There's a lot of design space there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269143/#Comment_269143" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-27T10:17:41+00:00" title="April 27, 2010 10:17AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Big J Money</cite>1) So it seems like there is a "game of imagination" happening. One in which the GM tries to create interesting conflicts restricted to solutions that involve task resolving abilities that player characters possess. Is this part of the appeal? It seems to me like maybe I would enjoy this in PREP, but that I might feel pressure trying to do it well at the TABLE in real time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DInDenver</cite>1) Well, that is one aspect. Another element is attempting overcome "roll until you fail" issues as well. Also, it puts a damper on "random" encounters, because most Conflict systems require you to sort of state what the whole fight is about. Which, as it turns out, is a great way to establish and maintain great communication between the GM and players.</blockquote>\nBuilding on this, John: One of the reasons the Intent &amp; Task mechanics work well in Burning Wheel (which both Thor and Dave are referencing, I believe) is that the game master can challenge aspects of the characters other than their skills and abilities.  While knowing things like a character\u2019s BITs and Relationships makes it easier to prepare a session, they really shine when the GM can leverage them in response to failed tests.  In play, they\u2019re a helpful touchstone that makes the GM\u2019s job easier, along with enriching the narrative.<br/><br/>This is one of the reasons I feel conflict resolution doesn\u2019t work in games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons.  The only mechanical tool the dungeon master has for challenging the characters is opposing their discrete skills and abilities, which leads to repetitive or flat play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269164/#Comment_269164" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-27T11:26:58+00:00" title="April 27, 2010 11:26AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From my perspective, the only important things to remember when considering this concept are:\n<ul><li>When a player picks up the dice, the GM should ask what he is intending to accomplish with his roll. Sometimes it's not obvious. You're trying to sneak up on the guard. Why? Because you want to knock him out? Why? So he can't raise the general alarm? Great!</li>\n<li>Once the GM understands the player's intent, the GM must ask himself: Is this a valid intent? Using your sneaking skill to silence a guard before he can raise the alarm is one thing. Using it to sneak past all the count's guards, break into his locked office and find the document you need is a stretch for a single test. That's more like three separate intents, each of which would require its own discrete skill (eg, Stealthy, Lockpicking and Read).</li>\n<li>It is essential that success means the player achieves what he intended. Success has to mean something. If the players successfully silence the guard, it is not cool to have some other guards stumble upon the unconscious guard and raise the alarm. If you do so, you are shitting all over the player's success. It's a bait and switch; you've given the appearance of success, but you are invalidating the intent behind the test. </li>\n<li>However, if the player fails the test, it allows your creativity as a GM to flower. You don't have to invalidate the task--the skill that was used in the intent. The only important thing is to foil the intent. This is when some other guards find the unconscious guard. The players's characters haven't been caught, but now they're wandering through the halls with fully alert guards actively looking for them. Failure means complications.</li></ul>\nPlaying this way does not take extensive prep. It's actually pretty easy to do on the fly. You just need to think about the player's intent and twist it so the players now have an additional problem to worry about. Try it a few times and you'll find it gets easier every time you do. And it also makes GMing more fun because you'll be surprised at he twists and turns games start to take. <br/><br/>You can use this technique in any game you play. The games mentioned above all have interesting takes on and variations of this technique.

I don't see what is clearly one intent in the first and clearly three in the latter.  It seems pretty easy to justify either goal as three (or more) little conflicts (tasks) OR as a single conflict.  What aesthetic informs the "stealth, lockpick, read" breakdown but not the "stealth, grappling/assassination, stealth" breakdown?<br/><br/>I think it's clear that at some point ("OK, roll to place your left foot in front of your right.") things are absurdly tedious.  And that at the other end of the spectrum ("OK, roll to see if you successfully travel to the south pole, delve half a mile into the rift, recover the chalice and free your god's son from his obligation in the underworld.") things are absurdly all-encompassing.

The previous session had ended with a cliff-hanger in the Player's Turn. A failed Circles test had led to the Moss Lord of Elmoss sending some of his soldiers to kick down the door of the house in which the patrol was staying and drag them off in the middle of the night. The next session would start in the Moss Lord's dungeons (I titled it In the Dungeon of the Moss Lord). The patrol's mission was to escape imprisonment and return to Lockhaven with their intelligence.<br/><br/>In Mouse Guard, you plan for a session by creating two Hazards out of a possible four: Mice, Animals, Weather and Wilderness. For this session, I chose Mice and Wilderness. <br/><br/>I decided the Mice portion would be a Complex Hazard. Here's how it broke down:\n<ol><li>Interrogation by the Moss Lord. Essentially they'd have to withstand torture.</li>\n<li>Breaking out of their cell.</li>\n<li>Dealing with a flame trap on their way out of the dungeon.</li></ol>\nI had guards, the arrival of Weasel slavers and a raging fire in reserve as potential Twists. Injury Conditions were also on the table.<br/>.<br/>The second hazard was a difficult journey back to Lockhaven on roads washed out by early spring rains. Flash floods and a hunting kestrel were the Twists I had on deck.<br/><br/>So for this particular session, the three beats of the Complex Mice Hazard and the one of the Wilderness Hazard had to be dealt with by discrete tests no matter what. No single test could make an end run around more than one. And each Twist added its own obstacle that had to be dealt with individually.<br/><br/>For games in general, as a GM I ask myself:\n<ul><li>Is this a single intent? Or is it actually multiple intents? There's no single answer here. It really comes down to what your group feels comfortable with. You can get extremely granular or play with a wide scope. It's just important to stay somewhat consistent.</li>\n<li>Is the proposed skill well-suited to the intent? Again, each group is going to have to decide this for itself based on their aesthetic preferences and the game they're playing. I can say, for instance, that I would feel very uncomfortable if someone tried to use Surgery to deal with a rampaging troll that was attempting to grind our bones. On the other hand, if we were to climb a tree to escape him, persuade him to let us attempt to cook him a meal and save our bones for another day, best him in a drinking contest to make him pass out, and then use Surgery to remove his teeth while he's passed out, I'd be jumping up and down with glee.</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269218/#Comment_269218" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-27T15:34:08+00:00" title="April 27, 2010  3:34PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris said, "To drill down into this a bit, when do you stop asking why?"<br/>\n<br/>\nTo answer it another way, you stop asking "why?" when you understand the character's motivation for engaging in the conflict.

I mostly blame this on the fact that it doesn't have a catchy phrase like "conflict resolution" or "task resolution". <br/><br/>On another note, this scaling issue with conflict resolution is part of the subtlety with relating it with story conflicts. In practice, any of the conflicts that define the overall story of the game shouldn't be resolved by a single address by conflict resolution mechanics. This will be extremely uninteresting - after all if the story is about the conflict between the PCs and the corrupt government officers who hurt their families, then actually resolving that conflict immediately kills the further potential of that story. There may be further stories, but this one has been resolved. Instead, there is a mediation between the story conflict and the conflicts which are described in terms of conflict resolution, often socially and informally worked, although some games will use varying levels of mechanical or guideline ties to ensure this relationship.<br/><br/>In any case, a conflict resolution focused game will tend to tile the story with these micro-conflicts, in much the same way that a task resolution focused game tiles the story with task attempts. It shouldn't be surprising, as these are the building blocks used in the game. But there is a tendency to assume that without ever present conflict resolution the top level story conflict won't be appropiately handled. But all you really need is a way to resolve the story conflicts at the top level and transform situations forward (whether it be task, conflict, or some other variation).<br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk" title="John Kirk"><img alt="John Kirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk">John Kirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269871/#Comment_269871" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-03T21:26:20+00:00" title="May  3, 2010  9:26PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry to jump into this discussion so late, but I can't resist putting in my two cents.<br/><br/>In my opinion, it is pointless to talk about the meaning of the terms "Conflict Resolution" and "Task Resolution".  Those terms have been bandied about for so long without any authoritative reference to define what they mean, there are now about as many definitions for those terms as there are people discussing them.  I've seen countless discussion threads like this trying to nail down exactly what the difference is between them, and they invariably end up like this one, with everyone honestly trying to provide their own views on the matter, but with no general consensus coming out of it.<br/><br/>I have avoided the use of these terms myself as much as possible for this reason.  During the research for my RPG Design Patterns book, however, I noticed that conflict systems can generally be divided into two types very easily.  I call these Negotiated Contests and Generalized Contests, which I <i>personally</i> see as the difference between Conflict Resolution and Task Resolution, although I have no doubt that some folks out there would argue with me.  However, since I coined these new terms, and defined them in my book, there is at least no ambiguity about what is meant by them.<br/><br/>If you are interested in these patterns, you can read up on them in the recently created RPG Design Patterns wiki that Felix Ple\u0219oianu kindly put together.  There are entries for both <a href="http://felix.plesoianu.ro/rpg/design-patterns/doku.php/pattern:negotiated_contest" rel="nofollow">Negotiated Contests</a> and <a href="http://felix.plesoianu.ro/rpg/design-patterns/doku.php/pattern:generalized_contest" rel="nofollow">Generalized Contests</a>, as well as a few other patterns dealing with <a href="http://felix.plesoianu.ro/rpg/design-patterns/doku.php/conflict_system_patterns" rel="nofollow">Conflict Systems</a> in general.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269875/#Comment_269875" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-03T21:49:08+00:00" title="May  3, 2010  9:49PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2010 1:00PM by Simon_C.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>I don't think you're right. I mean, I agree that the terms conflict resolution and task resolution are used a lot of different ways by different people, often in confusing and contradictory ways, but that's not the same thing as there not being a correct and agreed-upon meaning for the terms.<br/><br/>If you look at the discussion of the terms I gave above (I'll quote it here):\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>Folks try to make conflict resolution all complicated, but it's not really.<br/><br/>All rpgs (or at least the vast majority) have conflict resolution. There is a system (explicit or implicit, principled or ad hoc) for deciding if characters get what they want. That system can be as simple as "yes, they get what they want" or "The GM decides based on what seems cool", or as complex as you like.<br/><br/>All games also have task resolution. That's where you decide how well a character does a thing that they've set out to do. There is a system (explicit or implicit, principled or ad hoc) for deciding if they do well at the task or not.  That system can be as simple as "they do as well as the player says they do" or as complex as you like.<br/><br/>Many games, maybe most that you're familiar with, have explicit, principled task resolution, with complex rules, and then implicit, principled conflict resolution, with simple rules. Usually this looks like "roll some dice to see how well your character succeeds at the task, then the GM will decide if that gets your character what they want, based on what's realistic and what seems cool".  A lot of games that you're familiar with probably have more explicit conflict resolution for killing things, where the rule is "roll some dice to see how well the character hits the enemy, and then roll some dice to see if that kills them".<br/><br/>A common thing is to have conflict resolution rely on task resolution, or vise versa "Roll to see if your character succeeds at what they were doing, and if they're successful, they get what they want" or "Roll to see if your character gets what they want, and if they do, they succeed at doing something (you can say what) to get it".<br/><br/>Some games, maybe ones you're not as familiar with have experimented with explicit conflict resolution for all or most conflicts, alongside or instead of explicit task resolution. There's a lot of design space there.</blockquote>\nI think you'll find that it is mostly consistent with, for example, Vincent's use of the terms <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=58" rel="nofollow">here</a>, or Eero's use of the terms <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11453" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It sounds like Eero and I are saying different things, but in discussion with him it works out we're saying the same thing different ways.<br/><br/>What's more, I think there's a strong argument for this distinction being a useful one. That is, it is useful to be able to talk about what is being resolved by a particular mechanic - task or conflict - what gets resolved by the explicit system and what is left to an implicit system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk" title="John Kirk"><img alt="John Kirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20Kirk">John Kirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269881/#Comment_269881" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-03T22:52:50+00:00" title="May  3, 2010 10:52PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>John,<br/>...

That's exactly what that means.  If the terms are used a lot of different ways by different people, then there is obviously no universally agreed-upon meaning to the terms.<br/><br/>I am willing to concede that your statements concerning conflict and task resolution match up pretty well with Vincent's and Eero's.  I will also concede that your personal definitions for these terms are likely to have good solid value in terms of game play.<br/><br/>However, that is far from a consensus on what the terms mean.  Even in the thread where Eero piped in, there were various interpretations as to the meaning of the terms.  For example, Nameless interprets Task Resolution as "What are you doing?" while Conflict Resolution is "Why are you doing it?".  Those are also possibly valuable insights into how RPGs should be played.<br/><br/>Agony has this to say in the same thread: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>Eero's definitions make sense but are a bit complicated.  What I was talking about in my original post was pretty much what Lee said.  When I say "Conflict Resolution", I mean setting stakes, perhaps making a single roll to reconcile a conflict which might encompass multiple discrete actions.  When I say "Task Resolution", I mean rolling for each individual task in the process without setting stakes ahead of time.<br/></blockquote>\nFrom what I see, people constantly feel the need to define what they mean by the terms, and debate as to whether their definitions match up with other people's definitions (sometimes they do, sometimes they don't).  It seems pretty obvious to me that this means there is no universal consensus as to what the terms mean.<br/><br/>It all usually ends up that the definitions provide no clear-cut way to discriminate between the two cases that work all the time, and that is the crux of the problem.  That's why I came up with my own terms and definitions that can always be unambiguously applied.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269887/#Comment_269887" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T04:50:12+00:00" title="May  4, 2010  4:50AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John:<br/><br/>Terminology is a difficult thing for an Internet community like this, isn't it? For my part I have no problem ignoring general discourse when figuring out the terms I want to use and what they mean - and the fact that there's somebody out there spreading misinformation about the words and their meanings certainly isn't a reason for me to switch up my conceptual framework. In fact, the opposite is true in many ways, as usually the only worthwhile terminology and models of thinking are the ones that also garner their share of grassroots confusion; were I to refuse to engage any models of thinking that are surrounded by misinformation, I would be forced to limit myself to the most marginal ways of thought. Thus I find it better to shift through the trash and find the useful, logical and well-thought models of thought that lie behind the terminological noise. For instance, in this case - every thread where conflict and task resolution are hashed out, even if they seem pointless when you've yourself laid the matter to rest a long ago, will allow others to view the range of thought involved with the terminology, allowing them to pick and choose who to believe. It's a clear enough process, even if it seems never-ending because there are always new people coming into the dicussion.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, Simon defined both conflict and task resolution very clearly up there in post <a href="/forums/search?Search=%2310&amp;Mode=like">#10</a>, and he did it in a way that should find little argument from informed theorists. I think that you'll find that even if there's plenty of noise, most folks will either essentially agree with him or opt to ignore the Forge tradition of discussion to invent their own meanings for the terminology. Is the existence of uninformed, misinformed and differently-informed people really a motivation for abandoning the whole terminology and the model of thought behind it, when regardless of the confusion a core of agreement exists among a well-informed minority? That seems like a quirky epistemology to me.<br/><br/>(Because this is the Internet, I should note that I use the words "well-informed" and "uninformed" above in no judgmental manner, merely reflecting the fact that this whole task vs. conflict resolution discussion and the associated terminology descends rather clearly from Forge circles where no meaningful confusion regarding these terms exists. What I call "uninformed" might well be a very useful viewpoint and model of thinking even if it bears no relation to the original discourse.)<br/><br/>Also: while interesting, your negotiated vs. generalized contest terminology does not capture the core meaning of conflict resolution at all. You're describing different patterns of mechanical structuralization that can be applied to either conflict or task resolution - or in fact any kind of resolution, as the difference you pinpoint is between two different strategies of reaching an agreement, which has relatively little to do with roleplaying per se.<br/><br/>If it would make anybody feel better, I'm sure that somebody can write down the normal meaning of conflict vs. task resolution terminology and put it up at a blog somewhere or something. This really isn't any big controversial topic in rpg theory, it hasn't been that for the last five years. It seems to me that the current interest among practicing designers is much more in practical applications of what else can we do with conflicts aside from resolving them.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Also, because I only now noticed this thread and the issue of scaling conflicts is interesting to me; I'm thinking of Chris's question about sneaking past the guard. There are different ways of finding out the exact stakes of a conflict in different games:\n<ul><li><i>Sorcerer</i> model is that the GM understands the characters in conflict as literary actors with dramatic intent. When they roll off in a conflict, that roll determines the relationship of domination for these actors in this situation. Therefore there is no need for explicit stakes-setting prior to the roll, and we can say that if the player character wins the roll against the guard, then he gets his way as regards the guard, but not as regards the queen later on: the queen is a separate dramatic actor, she has a right to defend herself from blackmail. Particularly, the issue of whether the conflict resolution only concerns sneaking past the guard or also covers finding the right documents is answered when we notice that the guard is the only dramatic actor in the situation; winning him already resolves the immediate scene.</li><li><i>Dust Devils</i> and other narration-sharing games involve a statement of intent on the parts of the player characters (it's called "stakes", but note that it involves what the player characters want, not what the player wants to have his character accomplish) and a very Sorcerer-like conflict procedure to find out which character is immediately dominant in the situation. However, the game does not use Sorcerer-like dramatic methodology in arbitrating the consequences of conflicts; rather, one specific player is chosen to arbitrate the consequences of the conflict, which means that he gets to pace the conflict: if that player decides that it'll be interesting to run another conflict about safe-breaking, or decides to skip that and go directly into blackmailing the queen, then that's his prerogative.</li><li>A game like <i>The Mountain Witch</i> paces conflicts in a rather interesting way in that the game mechanics determine how "big" your resolution gets to be. Specifically, the rules determine whether you get to wound your opponent or kill them, and they determine whether the character gets as much as he's immediately seeking, or perhance more. Therefore the conflict is paced by the mechanics, largely after dice have been rolled. (<i>In A Wicked Age</i> uses this same model, incidentally.)</li><li>Some games use outright dramatic arcs to determine when and how much is resolved. <i>Polaris</i>, <i>Zombie Cinema</i>, <i>Under the Bed</i>... there's a lot of these games. Usually they use some sort of smaller conflict resolution mechanic as well in addition, but some particularly important conflicts are shunted aside and made untouchable by the general mechanic in favour of making the rules tell you "not yet" - only once the game has reached an appropriate stage are you allowed to resolve the conflict in question.</li></ul>\nAll of the above are just different ways conflict resolution can be paced. Almost all discussion of "how to do conflict resolution" is very localized in that roleplaying really has a myriad ways of handling conflicts, including some games where they're not resolved at all, but rather postponed, subsumed or not allowed to rise at all. Thus it's potentially very confusing if you mistake explanations of how to do conflict resolution in a particular game with a generic definition of conflict resolution; the concept itself is simple, but the ways to use it to benefit game design are a multitude.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269917/#Comment_269917" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T11:46:58+00:00" title="May  4, 2010 11:46AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a quick note, IME, PTA works by virtue of its TV show structure.

The participants determined the definitions because they needed to distinguish whether or not a system helped resolve a conflict or not. To be sure, lots of terms that stemmed from those conversations are a semantic quagmire. But these ones are really straightforward:</p>\n<p>When you do something, does it resolve whether or not you've gotten what you wanted (all sorts of interesting stuff can be attached to this, but what I just said is the core)? If so, that's conflict resolution. Whether you resolve that through tasks or not is irrelevant, but that's how most games of the day worked: you'd have discreet tasks that you could resolve that didn't actually make anything happen.

The terms are popular precisely because they strike a chord with a great many people.  But, I also think it is prudent to point out the inconsistent and/or vague use of those terms when answering questions posed by people trying to understand the lingo.  I personally think that the waters have become so muddied by different people's perspectives on the matter that it is just better to start with a clean slate, which is why I came up with my own terms.  That may be presumptive, and maybe a little arrogant on my part, but I do think it helps to convey my own meaning better than if I had stuck with the old terminology.<br/><br/>As far as the matter being settled by "informed theorists", I'm not sure I agree.  They may all be in agreement in the circles with which you are familiar.  However, I consider myself at least reasonably well informed about RPG theory, including those developed largely on the Forge, and yet I am here disputing away. :-)  That does not mean that I consider myself infallible, though, and I may very well be wrong.

Up to this point, I felt that my own definitions for Negotiated Contests and Generalized Contests did not actually contradict in any big way the definitions for Conflict Resolution and Task Resolution you presented in the other thread.  (I felt that my own definitions were more clear-cut, and their focusing purely on mechanical processes rather than player intent was a strength rather than a weakness, but that doesn't mean they contradicted yours.)  To help me better understand, can you provide me an example of what you would consider Conflict Resolution where the stakes are set before the characters encounter a conflict?  Or, alternately, can you provide me with an example of what you would consider Task Resolution where the stakes are set after the characters encounter a conflict?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269999/#Comment_269999" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T21:21:58+00:00" title="May  4, 2010  9:21PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>Your "negotiated conflict" description seems confused about whether conflicts exist between characters or between players.  This is, in my opinion, an important distinction. You write:\n<blockquote>One person introduces an idea that he thinks would be exciting or interesting, and if the others in the group agree to that idea, then that idea is accepted as having taken place. When one person wants to introduce something into the game world but another player wants something else, a conflict arises. The Negotiated Contest design pattern allows players to negotiate a collection of possibilities that are acceptable to all involved and then determine through some mechanical means which possibility is actually incorporated into the game world. </blockquote>\nThis is, in my opinion, not a useful description of RPG play.<br/><br/>Role playing games do have systems for resolving conflicts between players, but these systems are typically at the social contract level, or embedded in the authorities and responsibilities given to different player roles. Some games have conflict resolution systems that partially or exclusively grant authorities to players, but this isn't the basis of conflict resolution. A small number of games concern themselves entirely with apportioning responsibilities and authorities to players. Systems that do this are not the same as conflict resolution systems.<br/><br/>Conflict resolution is about conflicts between characters. It does not resolve disagreements between players over what is entered into the fiction. It determines whether characters get what they want or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270016/#Comment_270016" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T02:41:10+00:00" title="May  5, 2010  2:41AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, here's an example of conflict resolution with mechanically pre-determined stakes:<br/><br/>D&amp;D's combat system has always been a conflict resolution system in all editions, and its stakes have always been rather predetermined. It's a conflict resolution system because it resolves contrary character intents, and it has pre-determined stakes because the system only really works when it's an issue of who takes the field, who lives, who dies - anybody who's tried using the system knows that protecting somebody, avoiding the enemy, avoiding combat, taking the opponent alive or other such secondary martial goals are really rather arbitrary and ill-defined in the system.<br/><br/>Note that individual combat rounds are commonly defined as tasks in D&amp;D; those are not conflicts. The over-all conflict is the combat in whole, and that's what is resolved by the system.<br/><br/>Also, here's an example of task resolution without mechanical pre-determination; I'll grab this from the same game just for the kicks:<br/><br/>In early versions of D&amp;D, which don't have a skill system, tasks were specifically resolved without pre-determined system and most especially without pre-determined stakes. The Mentzer D&amp;D rules suggest that the GM might want to have a player roll an ability check of their own devising (d20 under the ability score, whatever) when uncertain as to how a character fares in a general task situation. This is task resolution because it is not concerned with character intent but rather what characters do, but it does not rely on pre-determined definitions of skills or abilities or agreed-upon stakes and pacing; all those matters are resolved by the GM case-by-case.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Simon's right about the player/character distinction, I considered mentioning that myself. I take it from the writing style of Design Patterns that it doesn't really concern itself with nuances like player vs. character distinction, but for practical conflict resolution theory this happens to be a very important thing: many styles of roleplaying game need for the players to not completely align their characters with their own interests, or require them to limit the exercise of their aesthetic judgment over the game in certain manners. All this fails if the player always insists that his character will, of course, do what he the player wants, and the game's content should, of course, proceed exactly in the way he wants. To the contrary, almost all roleplaying games live in the space where players are willing to accept external input into their imaginings, and nearly all of these resolve disagreements by coaching the players to cooperate towards a common goal rather than encouraging them to disagree.<br/><br/>Insofar as the "right" definition of conflict resolution goes, of course people can't be prevented from using words any which way. I don't even mind if somebody wants to invent a new word for the concept. The important part is that the idea behind the term gets the consideration it deserves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

You don't have to invalidate the task--the skill that was used in the intent. The only important thing is to foil the intent... </blockquote>\n<h3>Failure is Always an Option</h3>\nPerhaps deciding how to chunk intent can be tied to the resolution mechanic in some whay. Say for example you have a mechanic where you roll a d10 and try to match or beat a target value that ranges from 0\u201310. (Said target value might vary based on percieved difficulty of the task/conflict plus player input.) The players could negotiate for a wide scope statement of intent (<q>sneak past all the count's guards, break into his locked office and find the document you need</q>) an addition to the target value that could be based on the number of agreed-upon chunks in the goal. This negotiation would be on the player level and take into consideration the loss of fun/agency that would accompany a too-easily-accomplished wide scope goal. Then, once the adjusted target value is agreed upon, dude makes the roll. If he succeeds, fine; if he fails, he can try again, with a narrower intent (Just sneak past the guards and break into the office, say) but <em>with an added complication</em> of some sort, either provided by him, or the other players (GM included, of course). New Target value is set, dude rolls again, rinse and repeat until success.<br/><br/>Players might quickly reach an equilibrium between getting stuff done quickly, and high-control tedium. Plus, the complications can take on lives of their own, as Thor implied.\n<h3>Too Many Cooks...</h3>\n<cite>Thor said:</cite><q>...it is not cool to have some other guards stumble upon the unconscious guard and raise the alarm.</q><br/>So how do you deal with the actions of other players? Can their screw-ups also not bring the guards down on the Sneak's head?<br/><br/><hr/><br/><em>edit: Sorry about those huge headers before.

This shouldn't result in the Sneak getting caught - he already resolved whether he could evade the guards, and no take-backs! - but it would be totally fair to have this result in complicating things for him, at least by changing some circumstances.<br/><br/>As far as chunking is concerned, I am intrigued by your idea of chunking. Personally, I think that one is forced to gauge how complex a given Big Conflict was intended to be, and then determine the number of, ew, chunks from there. ^_^<br/><br/>So in our Fortress example, if the intel you need is just a name, a clue in a larger web of intrigue, I'd be comfortable with leaving the B&amp;E attempt to only one or two chunks. On the other hand, if you're looking to steal the Evil Plans or something, which would be a game-changer for your side of the situation, several chunks might make more sense. <br/><br/>Certainly, there's an overarching CONFLICT happening behind, or far behind, every con-rez roll; you're gonna have to take a look at that big-deal conflict and deciding how much of that you're willing to resolve in a single die roll. And this isn't just from the GM's perspective, either - if we conclusively settle the conflict of "do you find the intel you need" in a single roll, what if you fail the roll? Then you might have to decide (as a group) whether there IS any such intel TO be found!<br/><br/>And now I'm off to read John's splitoff thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
