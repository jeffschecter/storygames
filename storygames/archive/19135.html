The games vary in complexity, length, and level of participation.<br/><br/>Here's an example of the game <strong>Eulogy</strong>. In Eulogy, players take turns celebrating their "dead" friend's life\u2014the weirder the remembrances the better.<br/>One player is chosen to be dead first; in this game that player is Sarah. Dead players may choose to lie motionless atop the table, but this is purely a matter of personal conscience.<br/><br/>The player to Sarah's right draws the top card from the deck and offers their memory.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.travestygames.com/shindigmachine/eop_climber.jpg"/>\n<blockquote><em>"Sarah was always in a hurry. Her mother said she could feel a difference when carrying Sarah; unlike her siblings, when Sarah kicked it always seemed like she was actively trying to get out, not just playfully jostling her mother's organs. This carried over to her childhood. Sarah was always Go Go Go even when the car was parked at a red light. She was never angry about it though. Sarah was just excited to live."</em></blockquote>\nThe next player to the right draws a card from the deck:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.travestygames.com/shindigmachine/eop_fishbowl.jpg"/>\n<blockquote><em>"Things changed for Sarah when she hit her teen years. She became awkward and withdrawn, convinced that everyone around her was watching everything she did and judging her for it."</em></blockquote>\nThe next player goes:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.travestygames.com/shindigmachine/eop_knifeback.jpg"/>\n<blockquote><em>"Fresh out of college, Sarah turned to the lucrative field of murder. She became known as the Cudgel, which didn't make much sense since her preferred weapon was a knife. She was angry for years about this stupid nickname."</em></blockquote>\nNext:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.travestygames.com/shindigmachine/eop_prison.jpg"/>\n<blockquote><em>"Eventually, she got bored and went to prison. It was here that she carried our her real life's work: a series of bizarre manifestos attacking college as a concept. She alternately claimed that it was worthless and blamed it for her murder career. The one thing she never expected was for College to strike back. She died in her cell, under mysterious circumstances."</em></blockquote>\nLastly:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.travestygames.com/shindigmachine/eop_volcano.jpg"/>\n<blockquote><em>"The thing I'll remember most about Sarah are the screaming, screaming shits she used to take. Those things were vile."</em></blockquote>\nAnd that's one game of Eulogy.<br/><br/>If you're interested, there's more info on Shindig Machine (including examples of play for some of the other games) <a href="http://www.travestygames.com/shindigmachine/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and you can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shindig-Machine/dp/1935913034/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389560889&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=shindig+machine" rel="nofollow">purchase it from Amazon</a> now as well.<br/><br/>Thanks for your time.

I'm a big fan of it as well.<br/><br/>Regarding your questions:<br/><br/>This is a game I designed.  If you're asking about where the idea came from (which you probably aren't) I would say Scott McCloud's Making Comics initially (specifically the visual of grids of comic panels rather than linear lines, which figures heavily into 2 of the game types) and Whose Line Is It Anyway later (for all the situation based game types)<br/><br/>I've done 3 other board games:<br/>Kill Ball - a 1v1 Futuresport board game<br/>Psiduel - a 1v1 Psionic Dueling card game<br/>Deathfear - a multiplayer free-for-all dicefest dungeon crawl board game<br/><br/>You can see (or buy!) them all <a href="http://shop.travestygames.com/" rel="nofollow">here.</a><br/><br/>I'm going to have to ask for clarification on the last question, since I'm not sure exactly what you're asking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428137/#Comment_428137" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-08T13:22:01+00:00" title="February  8, 2014  1:22PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks man.

FTAL is doing well in stores (we are into the second printing) I didn't take it to Kickstarter - maybe I'll take the follow up game there: City of Broken Dreams (Hollywood) and Die Romeo Die.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/VALIS13" title="VALIS13"><img alt="VALIS13" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/505/nHOXUE6FO675U.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/VALIS13">VALIS13</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428247/#Comment_428247" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-12T04:15:40+00:00" title="February 12, 2014  4:15AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There needs to be more volcanic shitting in story games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gilbert_Nicoll" title="Gilbert_Nicoll"><img alt="Gilbert_Nicoll" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gilbert_Nicoll">Gilbert_Nicoll</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428322/#Comment_428322" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-16T11:14:30+00:00" title="February 16, 2014 11:14AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last day to get Shindig Machine at 20% off!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shindig-Machine/dp/1935913034/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top" rel="nofollow">Click here to buy it now!</a><br/><br/>And thanks to everyone who has responded here so far.
