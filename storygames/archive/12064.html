I'm not a fan of the Paranoia XP rules as written, so I threw a little Otherkind hotness in to mix it up.<br/><br/>It went well. I wound up with 8 players, which could have been difficult to handle, but fortunately the players were less note-happy than previous groups I've run it for. They varied from someone who remembers Paranoia the first time round to people who only knew it by reputation and the card game. They all claimed to have had fun.<br/><br/>The Otherkind I implemented was:<br/>1 - disastrous failure<br/>2,3 - failure<br/>4,5 - success with caveats<br/>6 - perfect success<br/><br/>Three dice rolled and assigned to success, consequences and stealth. Perhaps it was a quirk of the group, but they seemed to emphasise success beyond stealth, which in turn meant people would shoot them for treasonous behaviour, and also want to emphasise success.<br/><br/>In hindsight, 3 dice gives too great a chance of getting that magical 6, so if I run it this way again I might drop the consequences category, folding potential for getting wounded into the success die. Fortunately, it didn't seem to break things too much.<br/><br/>Specific Prep:<br/>I wrote up index cards for mutant powers and secret societies, chosen randomly from the book, then shuffled and dealt one of each to the players. The mutant power cards had a brief description of what it did, and a break down of how to interpret the success die when that power was used. They didn't get used that much, actually, as everyone was being quite cagey. Secret Society cards also had the SS mission written on them. I made them tie into one another where I could, just to get the players working at cross-purposes. Team Roles were also given out randomly. Where the role allowed someone to fine someone else, it mentioned it on the card.<br/><br/>For money, I used some Monopoly notes. Last time I ran the players were rather blas\xe9 about their fines, and I felt that actually having to hand over something physical might make them more reluctant to incur fines. As it turned out, I had a lot of fun messing with the players over their change. Only 2 out of the 8 were able to pay their monthly rent at the end of the session.<br/><br/>I tried to have a sort of evidence mechanic, where players could track what dirt they had on other troubleshooters, but that seemed to fall by the wayside in favour of more laser-happy play. The players seemed to want it, so I rolled with it.<br/><br/>How it went:<br/>The team were dispatched to root out mutant commie saboteurs in a new, experimental express parcel delivery centre. Of course, in actual fact the centre was failing due to the ridiculous nature of its delivery mechanisms, but of course Friend Computer's plans were flawless so it had to be sabotage. The secret society missions seemed to absorb everybody's attention, and a scapegoat was found on the Orange Clearance supervisor. The resident Frankenstein destroyer kept finding ways of setting off bombs in the sorting office, and a delivery RocketBot made a few holes in the walls. The whole fiasco ended when a converted NukeBot turned out not to have has its payload removed after all. Debriefing was brief, given that 2 players had used up all their clones by that point, and another had pretended to have used up all his clones so he could go AWOL. The session was summed up by the Team Leader presenting his evidence against the scapegoat:<br/><br/>"Citizen, what evidence do you have against the shift supervisor?"<br/>"He was clearly a Commie mutant traitor because we shot him as a Commie mutant traitor!"<br/><br/>It was sufficiently ballsy that I hadn't the heart to argue.<br/><br/>Other golden moments:<br/><br/>"Citizens! I have been trying out a new recipe for cake. Who would like to volunteer to try a slice?"<br/><i>Everyone does.</i><br/>"Why thank you, Friend Computer! It is delicious and moist!"<br/><br/><i>Someone needs change for a 10cr fine, but they only have a 20. I take it off them and give them nothing back.</i><br/>"Friend Computer, there seems to have been an error with my account."<br/>"You are in error, citizen. All is in order."<br/>"But friend computer, I appear to have been given too much change."<br/><i>He hands over another 20.</i><br/>"Your diligence and honesty are noted, citizen! Please accept this reward."<br/><i>I hand him a 100.</i><br/><br/><i>I had already decided that the RocketBot was going to cause major property damage when it was sent on its way, but I had to contain my laughter when one of the players actually tinkered with it first.</i><br/><br/>"Friend Computer, I wish to report-"<br/>"Your call is very important to Friend Computer. You are being held in a queue. There are 463,298 people ahead of you. Please be aware that hanging up before your call is connected constitutes treason."<br/><br/><i>After I pull the 'phantom ticking noise' trick on someone, I get a note from them which reads: "I am rocking back and forth in a corner, crying."</i><br/><br/><i>One delivery mechanism was a harness attached to a rail, where a volunteer would be dragged by the harness to the destination carrying the package. The rail ended going through a letterbox. The volunteer managed to get free in time, but the trombone he'd been given by Outfitting wasn't so lucky.</i><br/><br/><i>Someone has to pay a 10cr fine, but they only have a 500. I take it off them and give them a 1 as change.</i><br/>"..."<br/><br/>"Friend Computer-"<br/>"Your call is very important to Friend Computer. You are being held in a queue. There are INTEGER OVERFLOW people ahead of you. Please be aware that hanging up before your call is connected constitutes treason."<br/><br/>"So where was the NukeBot headed?"<br/>"I don't know, who set the destination?"<br/><i>Everyone looks at the dead shift supervisor on the floor.</i><br/><br/>"Citizens! I have been trying out a new recipe for cake. Who would like to volunteer to try a slice?"<br/><i>Everyone does.</i><br/><i>Everyone dies of poisoning.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270293/#Comment_270293" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T15:53:22+00:00" title="May  6, 2010  3:53PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for writing this up, Ben-it's hilarious.
