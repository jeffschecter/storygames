Years, probably. Recently, I stumbled across a design option for my <a href="http://towerlands.legendary.org/index.php/Conflict_Resolution" rel="nofollow">conflict resolution system</a>, which I think rocks on toast. We can talk about that here, if you want, but I really want to talk about the game's reward system. <br/><br/>See, conflict resolution systems provide toys to play with. They can change the pace of the game and add tactical interest, but they're often one of the last things I consider. In this case, however, my mind came up with the dice crap first and I'm pretty jazzed by it, so it's gonna stay. That means I get to design the reward system around it.<br/><br/><i>Towerlands</i>, at its core, is a game about community. The essence of the setting is high fantasy after a terrible world cataclysm. The survivors have scattered and slowly are finding each other again and building little pockets of civilization. Man, was I grumpy when Wizards came out with its "points of light" concept! The big difference between D&amp;D and <i>Towerlands</i> is that D&amp;D heroes aren't dependent at all on the communities they protect. D&amp;D heroes might not even be heroes. They might just be genocidal treasure hunters and the villages they visit probably fear them more than love them. <i>Towerlands</i> heroes are heroes because they protect their communities and friends.<br/><br/>So what stops a <i>Towerlands</i> character from going off and being a genocidal treasure hunter? The advancement system makes characters dependent on people in their community. You start out one of those "bright light" people who is young and everyone knows will be someone special someday, but right now you're green and naive. It's a "zero to hero" game but your zero is still better than everyone else because you have courage. You forge relationships with people in your village and they have things to teach you: skills, essentially. <br/><br/>Each of these villagers has an agenda, though. You have to keep them happy, or they stop teaching you. If marauders kill your sword instructor, you'll have to find a new one. The mentor-student relationship can be less formal, too. Like, maybe you have a spouse who teaches you new things about yourself all the time, or maybe you have a student you're teaching, but you're learning patience and wisdom from him at the same time.<br/><br/>By threatening any of these relationships, the GM can create compelling situation quickly. By putting characters in dilemma situations, the player may have to choose between two different relationships and risk alienating or losing one of them.<br/><br/>Relationships also have a "refresh" power. As players tax the resources of their characters, the characters' abilities can get fatigued. Characters can go to their community to refresh those fatigued abilities. <br/><br/><b>Finally, the reward cycle</b><br/><br/>So what does <i>Towerlands</i>' reward cycle look like? I mean the big circle from action to reward, where the reward feeds back into the next action-reward cycle.\n<ol>\n<li>A character makes a connection with a community member.</li>\n<li>The community member offers the character new abilities, but usually with strings attached. </li>\n<li>The character performs some service for the community member.</li>\n<li>The character returns after completing that service and claims his reward (the new abilities).</li>\n</ol>\nThat's the basic cycle. Upon return, the community member probably has a new task for the character, and a new ability to offer as a bribe. That cycle is the in-game (character) reward cycle. Let's look at the player reward cycle:\n<ol>\n<li>The player chooses an NPC with abilities that might help his character grow, and with an agenda that syncs with her ideas of the character's agenda.</li>\n<li>The GM bribes the player with abilities at a rate cheaper than what is in the rulebook.</li>\n<li>The bribe comes with an adventure hook or some kind of moral dilemma for the player.</li>\n<li>The player decides if the ability is worth the trouble that comes with it.</li>\n<li>If so, the player completes the task and adds an ability to her character.</li>\n</ol>\nThere's a slightly different cycle at work here, too, when players have to make choices about which established relationship is more important. The player continually refines his collection of relationships so that she has access to abilities she needs for her character, but she has to balance the "meta" character optimization choices with more "in the personality" immersive character choices about what the character would do. <br/><br/>Is this a feature or a bug? Am I setting up a clash of Creative Agenda? I don't think so. A group that wants to play a Narrativist game will be confronted with real choices that test the character every step of the way. The GM can use NPC reactions to punish sociopathic behavior (for example, if a character uses people for training and fails to complete their end of the bargain): in short, the community will banish the PC, who will have no support network in which to learn and refresh. This is a strong Narrativist statement by the group. <br/><br/>On the other hand, if the group just wants to play a Gamist version of <i>Towerlands</i>, they can try to ignore these community consequences. The GM can ignore NPC reactions and just treat community members as resources who blithely hand out abilities and quests, like the automated NPCs in World of Warcraft. As long as the entire group is on the same page, this will work.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195618/#Comment_195618" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T09:32:09+00:00" title="March  5, 2009  9:32AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How automated is the NPC sends-you-on-a-mission-you-get-an-improvement part of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it like this:<br/>\nPlayer:  Man, Grognar almost drowned in that underwater river last time, I need to learn how to swim.  Hmmm...who in the village can teach me how to swim?  How about Cara, Cara's a good swimmer.  Hey Cara will you teach me to swim.<br/>\n<br/>\nGM:  Sure, but first you need to get me a selection of wild herbs from the otherside of the hill.<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;adventure&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer:  Here are your herbs<br/>\n<br/>\nGM:  You gain +1 Swim skill.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOr is it more like this:<br/>\nIn this village is a character named Cara.  There are three things that keep Cara happy:  Freshly baked bread, access to a ready suppy of herbs so she can help people with her healing skills, and going to chapel twice a week.<br/>\n<br/>\nCara can teach:  Basic Healing, Swimming, Folk Lore, and Throwing Great Parties for Villagers.  A PC can learn one level in any of these skills from Cara between adventures up to the lesser of Cara's Level or the PC's Relationship Score with Cara as long as Cara is happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nCara can be made unhappy by the GM by threatening any of the things that make her happy, such as:  Cara is feuding with the baker because his is making low quality bread and overcharging for it, a nest of giant ground spiders has invested her favorite herb patch, or the local priest has passed away and there's no one to hold chapel.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe adventure is the PCs figuring out which character's problem they want to solve and thus which combination of skills (and other benefits presumeably like inexpensive weapons, new suits of clothes, care for the horses, etc) they want to have access to.  In this example, the baker is making low quality bread because the Miller is adulterating his bread with hulls and he's overcharging because his wife is threatening to leave him if he can't support a more comfortable life style for her.  The Miller, by way of his location some distance from the village, also happens to have connections as a fence and has been offering the PCs the best prices on the loot they bring back from their adventures.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second sounds more fun to me than the former.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195621/#Comment_195621" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T09:56:21+00:00" title="March  5, 2009  9:56AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not formalized yet, but it's like the second example.

I mean the villager is not going to see the genocide really and even if they did, they would probably perfer genocide over the occassional cow or kid being eaten by kobolds. I see this as more of a problem with the assumption of human rights that gets imported into dnd to prevent things like 'oh your a female fighter? you can polish my armor and I'll only sexually harass you mildly squire" that somehow humanrights (or rather demihuman rights) apply to everything (including monsters) <br/><br/>Honestly if semi intelligent spiders/lizardmen/godzilla were invading new york, in the modern day, and someone stopped them, by killing them all. I dont think too many people would call them genocidal mad men. <br/><br/><b>Dnd  </b> <br/>Talk to NPC              <br/>Go on Quest            <br/>Get Reward     <br/> <br/><b> Towerlands</b><br/>Talk to NPC <br/>Go on Quest <br/>Get Reward<br/>now your saying the reward is of a different quality or the quest is , but hey smashing spiders in herb patches is smushing spiders. Perhaps it would be more awesome of instead of rewards like (+1 swim ) you got friends. Instead of learning things (which honestly can take quite a long time and can stretch credibility. ) you get friends to do things for you. Your pc's will naturally be good at smushing spiders and then can trade these skills for access (not learning) other skills. This way instead of learning to swim, the npc will go swimming for you (retreaving more treasure or activating underwater levers or whatever). This leads to a favor economy rather than awesome uberdude pc's. <br/><br/>Just a thought, best of luck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195654/#Comment_195654" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T11:55:15+00:00" title="March  5, 2009 11:55AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite><b>Dnd</b><br/>Yeah I'm also having some trouble telling the difference between example one and example two. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Talk to NPC<br/>Go on Quest<br/>Get Reward<br/><br/><b>Towerlands</b><br/>Talk to NPC<br/>Go on Quest<br/>Get Reward</blockquote>\nPartly, it's how it's framed. Why do D&amp;D characters kill kobolds? The game generally doesn't provide an answer. This is left to the players and DM. The answer could be, "Because the village the heroes grew up in is under attack!" or it could be "Who cares? the kobolds have copper pieces and are worth 100 XP each." <br/><br/>More importantly, in D&amp;D, it doesn't matter if you make the NPCs happy. If you kill kobolds, you get XP. Further, it doesn't matter which NPC you make happy. If you get enough XP to level up by pleasing Joe the Blind Wizard instead of Bob the Maniacal Warrior, you get the same choices for your character.<br/><br/>In Towerlands, the game structure explicitly tells the GM to get the players invested in the community. If they don't protect the village, they'll lose their people, and those people are their gateway to advancement. Killing the kobolds isn't enough. If they let Joe the Blind Wizard die, they won't have anyone to teach them the Spell of Icy Wind. If they let Bob the Maniacal Warrior die, they won't have anyone to teach them Axe through Your Skull. Every choice about community will have an impact on their advancement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195661/#Comment_195661" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-05T12:25:01+00:00" title="March  5, 2009 12:25PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>hmmm, what am I missing, that doesn't sound much like the second example to me...</blockquote>\nIt's the same in structure, but perhaps we are focused on different aspects of what make your two examples different. <br/><br/>In any case, it's never just a menu of things an NPC can do with a list of prices (even if the prices are quests).

I think, in the real world, people do learn things on their own. They learn without the consent of people they copy from. They learn by experimenting. The rulebook prices represent learning it the hard way, without help, and I think only a basic subset of things are available there at all. You might learn Punch People in the Face, but not The Ancient Art of Crushing your Nose with My Fist.<br/><br/>Yes, doing this the wrong way could kill my conceit. Doing it the right way could emphasize it, though. I think. If players must decide to learn things on their own or learn from people in the community, then it's a real choice. If I force players to learn from the community, there's no "aha" moment.<br/><br/><br/>Daniel,<br/><br/>The "trading-favors" thing is in there, but as a constant negotiation between GM and players. Does that make it feel less like "playing the community as your character," since you-as-player don't really control the community and have less ability to game it?<br/><br/>What I'm going for: Heroes who realize that their rise to fame is and was dependent upon the help of many other people.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a side note, there will be other places for people to gain abilities, I think. Community members are the main way, but magical abilities might be gained by making deals with spirits or temple gods. Keeping these abilities may depend on pleasing these powerful beings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195849/#Comment_195849" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T08:46:47+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  8:46AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>If players must decide to learn things on their own or learn from people in the community, then it's a real choice.

However, I think that'd be strengthened by having PC actions generate the threats to their relationships, rather than having the GM generate the threats "from outside".<br/><br/>Example 1:<br/>Begins with GM coming up with a cool Frost Locust monster.  GM looks for an excuse to aim a quest at it.  GM picks the NPC who delivers the most useful training to PCs, and has the Locust abduct her.  This is basically "kill Kobolds for XP" in function (though that may not be a problem, as the difference in color is so huge).<br/><br/>Example 2:<br/>Begins with a choice the PCs made in the previous mission coming back to effect their community in a predictable way.  "We knew killing the Weather Witch would bring a blizzard, but we deemed it worth it to get her Scroll of Cow-Protection and erase the plague.  But now, the snows are threatening to close down Trader Fred's business.  He won't teach you anymore unless you help him find a new pass over the mountains!"  And <i>then</i> the GM sticks his Frost Locust into the scenario at some point.<br/><br/>I'd vote for Example 2 over Example 1.<br/><br/>I don't know if this is compatible with your vision, it's just the kind of reward cycle I get excited about.  Saving the cows while knowing you're buying a different sort of trouble for next session rocks my world.<br/><br/>If I were designing a resolution system based on what you've described, I'd make sure that every personal victory produced some complication for the community (though maybe not instantly, nor un-preventably).<br/><br/>Separately, I'm curious about the identity of the "hero" in "zero to hero".  I can see two very different paths:<br/>1) A hero has +5 to hit monsters.  Much of play is spent fighting monsters.  Going into the town and interacting with NPCs is largely a means to that end.  Players strive to meet veteran soldiers.<br/>2) A hero is a community leader.  Fighting monsters is mostly about building social status.  Interacting with NPCs is a major play activity, forging connections and working your way up.  Players strive to meet politicos.<br/><br/>As for your CA clash worries, I think the GM should prep very differently based on the desired CA, so maybe a ruleset could advise him, "Find out how your players feel about X, Y, Z before prep, and focus on A or B or C accordingly."  I could see a group agreeing on Narr, but the GM prepping a dungeon crawl instead of a Dogs town out of habit if given no guidance.  Of course, if I were to take what you've written here and run with it, I'd be playing it Sim ("I want to enmesh with my community and see how my actions send ripples of consequence through it!").<br/><br/>Sorry if that was long and tangent-y.

I want a combination of both. Look at Daniel Solis' game (Do: Temple of the Flying Pilgrims) for a beautiful implementation of "each trouble begets more trouble," though he set it up that failures create more complications. \n<blockquote>I don't know if this is compatible with your vision, it's just the kind of reward cycle I get excited about.  Saving the cows while knowing you're buying a different sort of trouble for next session rocks my world.</blockquote>\nYes, it's compatible. I don't want the players to be <i>creating</i> their own trouble, though. I want the GM to be putting consequences in front of players, out in the open, and letting them navigate them and make hard decisions. "Geez, do we kill the Weather Witch, in which case we'll have to deal with the blizzard, or do we let her go, in which case she will send a plague of Flying Monkeys at the village?" And, of course, the village contains lots of people who will have opinions about the heroes' decision, and there might be training consequences as a result.\n<blockquote>Separately, I'm curious about the identity of the "hero" in "zero to hero".

I want heroes bouncing back and forth between exciting combat adventures and tense political and personal problems. There's enough danger right outside the walls of town that they don't have to go on long treks. <br/><br/>Everything is about the town and the community, because if the heroes ignore town, lots of people will die. It's that simple. The fighting is about fighting to protect the town or help the town in some way. The interpersonal conflict is about smoothing ruffled feathers in town, convincing people to do the right thing ("We need to move the village to a safer location!"), and inspiring townsfolk to fight for themselves. <br/><br/>Also, regarding "strive to meet politicos." Meh. The town isn't that big. This is a band of people clinging to survival, not a city with a complex social hierarchy. It's quite likely that the heroes become the community leaders. I guess you can have a larger town/city and play would work fine.<br/><br/>I think you're really asking if characters advance in fighting power or political power. Both. Also, "fighting power" includes tons of skills that help win conflicts in a variety of arenas: fighting, knowledge, personal, social. <br/><br/><br/>I think you're right about CA worries. A little GM advice should smooth it out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195926/#Comment_195926" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T12:26:52+00:00" title="March  6, 2009 12:26PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, Adam, question: is it kosher for the GM to set the townspeople against each other?

Am I a bad person to suggest that I like it if this is possible?</blockquote>\nMy thinking is that the town is basically assembled out of ruins already. The heroes would have to figure out what to do next. If they wander around the jungle and fight monsters, they will just put themselves at risk with no real reward other than the doing. Still, the GM would be wise to throw random lost people at them -- people who are in desperate need of organization and community. The heroes then can help or lead these people to creating a new town.<br/><br/>You are a bad person for many, many reasons, but not for suggesting that the entire town is at stake. I think this is what makes the heroes matter, right? If they fail, there are real consequences. I'm imagining game mechanics that require the PCs to choose who to kill off, too, the way <i>carry</i>'s ranking officer kills off fodder.\n<blockquote>How does the creation of the town happen?</blockquote>\nI have no idea, but I recognize that this is really important. Perhaps play starts without a town at all. The players travel around in the dangerous jungle until they meet people, gain their trust, and assemble them into a community. I imagine the GM going, "So, you find this cave and there seems to be someone living here already. Jack, who is it?" and then Jack says, "It's a blind old man. He's a martial arts instructor and a hermit." Or perhaps players write up cards with brief ideas (Oracle style) for people they could meet, and the GM draws from this pile of cards as the players encounter people in the wilderness.<br/><br/>My point is that assembling a town a person at a time and letting players create these people is a great way to build player investment in the community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_195952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195952/#Comment_195952" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T13:45:48+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  1:45PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't want the players to be <i>creating</i> their own trouble, though. I want the GM to be putting consequences in front of players, out in the open, and letting them navigate them and make hard decisions.</blockquote>Er, yeah, that's what I meant.  Word.\n<blockquote>Again, why are these paths mutually exclusive? I want heroes bouncing back and forth between exciting combat adventures and tense political and personal problems. There's enough danger right outside the walls of town that they don't have to go on long treks.</blockquote>I agree that they're not mutually exclusive.  I've just found that it's easy for one to wind up being "the main point" and the other to wind up in a supporting role, depending on where the most concrete rewards come from.\n<blockquote>Also, regarding "strive to meet politicos." Meh. The town isn't that big. This is a band of people clinging to survival, not a city with a complex social hierarchy.</blockquote>Hmm.  Doesn't that render social advancement irrelevant?  Shouldn't every villager be eager to kiss your ass and teach you everything they know, because you're the one keeping the community alive?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_195960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/195960/#Comment_195960" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-06T13:56:44+00:00" title="March  6, 2009  1:56PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Shouldn't every villager be eager to kiss your ass and teach you everything they know, because you're the one keeping the community alive?</blockquote>I think the point is that you prove to them that you're the one keeping them alive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
