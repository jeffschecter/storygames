This isn't too far from the way the books play out, if you've read them, so there was nothing particularly revolutionary about the concept.<br/><br/>I played Ernest Hemingway.  Another player took on the role of Machiavelli.  It went around the table like that.  The game was a total disaster, and part of it was due (I think) directly to the fact that we were trying to <i>be</i> these real people and it interfered with the game-y things we were called upon to do.<br/><br/>Just this afternoon I was looking at an (apparently terrible) Xbox 360 game called <a href="http://www.roguewarrior.com/" rel="nofollow">Rogue Warrior</a>.  In it, you take on the role of <a href="http://www.dickmarcinko.com/" rel="nofollow">Richard Marcinko</a>, founder of Seal Team Six and an all-around badass.  Because my brain is wired in strange ways, this game got me thinking back to that <i>Riverworld</i> game.  I find that I don't really <i>want</i> to step into the shoes of a real person to do game-type stuff.  It's can be beneath the person in question or totally out of character or just plain discomfiting because you feel a duty to that person to hew as closely to their actual self as possible.<br/><br/>Given my experience, I'd rather play someone <i>in the mold of</i> a real person.  Not Ernest Hemingway, but a writer of the Lost Generation with a penchant for manly pursuits.  Not Dick Marcinko, but a stone-hard Navy SEAL capable of taking out whole units of enemy on his own.  These may be outsized caricatures of the original person, but that's okay because we're only using the person as a stepping-off point, not as a model.<br/><br/>Or am I being too sensitive to the whole responsibility thing?  I mean, it <i>is</i> just a game and so we're free to take as many liberties as we want.  Right?  I dunno.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284619/#Comment_284619" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T09:09:43+00:00" title="August  6, 2010  9:09AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played Mamie Eisenhower once, fighting for her life on an island taken over by space-addled NASA chimps.
