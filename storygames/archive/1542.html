                    This is going to be the most inarticulate junk ever, and I'm mostly looking to be disabused of this notion, but here it is:<br/><br/>It seems to me that one of the basic principles of role-playing theory is that the more concretely we understand what we're doing, the better our play will be.  Ron and Josh's thread <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21694.30" rel="nofollow">over at the Forge</a> has led to the coinage "murk" (or possibly only brought it up) to refer to play that isn't conscience of technique.  Now, while I think that theory can directly improve our <em>design,</em> I'm realizing that I'm beginning to believe that rigid taxonomy is injurious to actual at the table play.  <br/><br/>I'm not saying that no one interested in role-playing should ever examine theory.  But I think theory needs to be internalized before it's useful.  Like a bicycle.  You can build a bike, and ride it, with no idea how it works.  But it takes a lot of study to understand how it works and improve it.  But you're not going to learn to ride a bike (or get to be an Olympic cyclist) by reading a book.  But someone needs to be reading the book to help you get to the Olympics, you know?<br/><br/>Now that I've qualified that into trivia, does anyone have any input?                </div>

Trying to apply theory directly at the gaming table is like trying to apply quantum physics to the question of how to fix your sink.  It's just not the right mental tool.  It <i>might</i> work, particularly if you're really, really smart and careful.  But I personally would be searching for some hip-boots while you were doing your calculations ... just in case.                        </div>

There's a reason I like this forum so much.<br><br/>Exactly.  Glad you already knew where I was going, because you saved me a lot of time fiddling with that idea.  I raise it as an issue because I see so much quantum dynamics in books that should be talking about crescent wrenches, you know?<br/><br/>"Craft."  Thanks, Tony!                        </br></div>

I'm going to slap your wrists for what you were slapping other people's wrists about earlier.  It's a basic principle of <strong>Ron's</strong> role-playing theories that better understanding leads to better practice.  That works for Ron, and works well for him.  It works well for some other folks, too.  It may not work for everybody.<br/><br/>Personally, I think better understanding leads to better <em>design</em>, and better design leads to better play.  You don't need to know jackshit about theory in order to enjoy playing <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em>, but you can be sure that theory informed the design that you'll be using.  I'm with Tony, here: you can think of all the theory-stuff at the table, but that's too damn taxing.  That's a whole lot of thought brought to bear on a very specific problem.  It's far more preferable to my mind to solve the very specific problem with a very specific tool.  Said tool is designed with theory, sure, but I don't have to reverse-engineer the entire thing before I use it.  I just say, "In this game, stakes are defined as what the <em>character</em> wants" and then move the fuck on.                        </div>

On the one hand, you're absolutely right.  <i>Mea culpa</i>  That is what I said.  On the other, my hidden subtext was "...and that's a problem."  I did say it was going to be inarticulate.  And part of my approach was couched in the idea that direct use of theory seems to be helping some people, but I've never seen it.  In other words, all the theory I've seen discussed (not just GNS) seems to come from a place that says, "use this at your table."  And I'm realizing that I'm leery of that message.  It's why I'm squicked by jargon in rules-texts, and by GNS replies to actual play issues.                        </div>

                            For some reason people increasinly miss where the arrow is pointed in Ron's discussions.  The disconnect always seems to be here:<br/>
<br/>
Player A does X and Player B does Y in response. (Where "does" can be almost anything.  Announcing an in character action, describing a bit of scenery, ending a scene, starting a scene, speaking dialogue, whatever....)<br/>
<br/>
The fundamental mistake people make when discussing Forge theory is to attribute an idea to either A, X, B or Y individually.  Most (not all) of the ideas in theory have to do with the space inbetween.  The social interaction, the communication, the cues, the tells, the unspoken language, whatever the hell you want to call it.<br/>
<br/>
Murk in that discussion is refering to Player A doing X and (given the game and social context) what is the range of EXPECTED acceptable RESPONSES Player B can give.  I've played in games with all kinds of murk.  I've played games where I've done X fully expected any reponse at all and instead getting a huffy player because clearly I *want* them do some specific Y in response and they don't think is cool.  I've played in games where I've done X fully expecting a very specific Y in response and found myself getting huffy because the Y I get is competely out of scope as far as I'm concerned.<br/>
<br/>
Illuminating what purpose action X serves and what are appropriate Y responses can only help make a game more clear in my opinion.  And that can be done without one lick of theory or jargon.<br/>

                            Two things:<br/><br/>I think that the best play occurs when you're not thinking about *anything*, but when play just oozes out of you naturally.  Like JBR said, design can make this easier, and knowing some theory can make this easier - but the application of theory or the thoughtful, conscious use of design and theory <i>during play</i> isn't the optimal solution.<br/><br/>It's just like with acting: the actor isn't standing there thinking about method acting and the poetic movements of Najinski when he or she is on stage - but having studied those things prior, simply uses them to get into the moment.<br/><br/>As to Jesse's 'murk', above:<br/><br/>The only cure for this isn't theory or craft - it's a complete informational state on the game at hand.  In order to completely remove 'murkiness' from the game, you'd need to announce not only your actions, but all of the relevant information about why the action was made and your intents.  Either you get better at telegraphing that in your play, or you live with the fact that the other players (and characters) aren't just sounding boards for amplifying your experience.  The only other alternative sounds incredibly boring to me.                        </div>

I don't think that's the case.  Have you seen the "What if this game was a Board Game?" section of Dogs in the Vineyard or the extremely clear What Players Do/What Producers Do sections of PtA?  All those go a long long long way to reduce murk.<br/><br/>Jesse.                        </div>

                            A couple of notes...<br/><br/>First, Judson, I think that for some players (like me) theory in play is fun.  I love deconstructing activities.  I find it enjoyable.  I enjoy movies more as I learn more about film-making techniques.  I get a kick out of noticing clever methodology in action.  This is true for me in roleplaying too.  I love being able to recognize techniques and their goals in action at the table.<br/><br/>Clearly not everyone enjoys things in this manner.  I know people who don't care a bit about film-making techniques.  Knowing them or not knowing them doesn't impact their enjoyment of a movie at all.<br/><br/>Brian, I basically disagree with you.  Or at least with your failure to include 'for some people' at the end of your statement about the best sort of play.  For me personally, related to the above stuff to Judson, the best play is highly intentionally constructed for me.  I love to intentionally layer in multiple meanings to actions, and to do things with intent for future things.  That's part of the fun for me.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            No doubt this is all the real danger to theoretical theory - it doesn't work the same way for everyone.  When dealing with people your chances of achieving some grand universals is pretty remote and so there is always going to be some resistance to disecting people's play.<br/><br/>Additionally some of the best play has been experienced by people that have no exposure to theory - you know, like when we were twelve.<br/><br/>I think that theory helps to develop more "consistently" good play especially as a gamer matures in the hobby (helps stave off the laws of diminishing returns).  I also tend to think this is a mixed bag - some theory helps some groups while other concepts are just lost on some groups.  Some groups just NEED to understand play style or aggresive scene framing while yet others gain more enjoyment from minutia and player conflict.<br/><br/>Even as a sociologist I think that whether or not someone would benefit from theory depends on the individual and where they are in their gaming.                        </div>

                            The clearing of murk in the aforementioned discussion is not about understanding theory (or, God help us, its terminology) behind play. It is not about clearing up any ambiguity whatsoever about what might happen in a game. It's only about being absulutely clear about what the acceptable procedures in play are, and how they're distributed among participants.

The problem becomes splitting hairs about how you come to that "clarity."  I suppose you could argue that "murk" is dispensed with even if the players just jive naturally but it doesn't sound like that was the intention of Juson's initial post.  <br/><br/>I grasped the idea of a social contract quite a while ago but I still had perfectly rocking campaigns without stating that clarity simply because I played with people that were in sync - we trusted each other so fully that everyone happily trucked along and rolled with anything that was thrown at them.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>

                            (Cross posted with Melinglor)<br/><br/>Hey Judson,<br/><br/>Ron's not saying you need theory to avoid the murky play- you need clear &amp; structured rules.  For example, I can play Universalis with people who've never played a roleplaying game before, much less heard of theory, and avoid the problem Ron is talking about (I called it "Floaty Play" a few months ago.  Same thing.).<br/><br/>Consider- what if Chess allowed you to have different starting positions for  your pieces, but no actual rules for how to set up those pieces?  Pieces set up one way, or another way, would make for vastly different games.  <br/><br/>That unstructured stuff has the same effect on roleplaying games, and is the reason people point to whether "gaming styles" are compatible or not, when really they're talking about unspoken and shifting structures being close enough to play together or not.<br/><br/>Chris                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thomas Robertson</cite>Brian, I basically disagree with you.  Or at least with your failure to include 'for some people' at the end of your statement about the best sort of play.</blockquote>
One brief note (and this goes over to the whole 'passion' deal in the 'Why can't we all just get along' thread): Really, is it necessary to append everything with 'in my opinion' and 'for some people' to everything?  I'm usually careful about equivocation, but I still think it's incredibly overused.<br/><br/>As to 'murk': Using chess as an example trivializes the problem.  Chess is a game where the entire experience is regulated by the rules - there's nothing in the game that is subjective.  The entire experience of RPGs is subjective - even, to a large extent, the interpretation of the rules.  This is part and parcel with what RPGs are - a way of structuring 'group imagining', as it were.  The more structure that you apply to the play of RPGs, the less is left to the imagination of the participants.  most of the flexibility of RPG play is in the margins - in the murk, if you will - where opportunities are left open and the gray spots on the map are full of new choices to make.<br/><br/>Having read over Ron's post, he's taking the exact opposite point that I am: that the elimination of these gray areas is something to be lauded.  To an extent, yes.  But in the long run, it's really impossible.  Why?  Because the elimination of murk turns an RPG into a really complicated version of chess - where all possible choices are determined by system instead of the players.  It'd still be a fantastically complex game (after all, there are more possible chess games than there are atoms in the universe) - but there's an ineffability to the experience of play that would be lost in translation.<br/><br/>I'll have to nail that ineffability down later - I have to go play Memory (and get my ass kicked) by my daughter.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>It's only about being absulutely clear about what the acceptable procedures in play are, and how they're distributed among participants.</blockquote>
Joel, you nailed part of my issue.  Although it was <em>inspired</em> by Ron and Josh talking about Bangs and whatnot, and especially Ron's use of the term "murk," murk doesn't refer in that context <strong>at all</strong> to what I'm talking about here.  I did say I was probably going to be inarticulate.  Sorry.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thomas Robertson</cite>First, Judson, I think that for some players (like me) theory in play is fun.  I love deconstructing activities.  I find it enjoyable.  I enjoy movies more as I learn more about film-making techniques.  I get a kick out of noticing clever methodology in action.  This is true for me in roleplaying too.  I love being able to recognize techniques and their goals in action at the table.</blockquote>
But, this is the sort of thing I'm coming to.  Theoretical deconstruction <em>after</em> play, I'm all about.  I call it a post mortem, and I don't think I'm alone.  Theoretical input in the design of a game, I'm all about.  In play, I sorta need my whole brain to be working on the game.  I want to train myself to do stuff well, and theory (any theory) helps that, but really I'm completely in debt to Tony here: the degree to which I'm playing the game well, I'd call craft.  And to be honest, to me, the appropriate bracket for craft starts at the printed page of the game manual and ends when the players agree to break.<br/><br/>Regarding murk directly: I don't see that it's really an issue of theory.  It's an issue of communication, and theory can help there if everyone shares a jargon.  If not, you're better off, probably, forgetting theory entirely and just hashing it out as best you can.                        </div>

Ok, I've read over Ron's post again - and here's something I take away from it: You only need to worry about murkiness if you're completely intent on a driving narrative.<br/><br/>Here's the part of Ron's post that tipped me off:
<blockquote><cite>Ron, on the Forge:</cite>Historically, role-playing is practically defined by a bunch of techniques hidden or at least isolated within a bunch of unconstructed dialogue. When I say "unconstructed," I don't merely mean "not rolling dice," and not even "open dialogue." I mean: primal chaos that cannot itself produce a solution (in the technical sense of that term). <b>No one knows what this interaction is supposed to be like. No one knows how it's supposed to get anywhere or accomplish anything.</b> Gamer culture avoids the question as if it's a deadly disease; "game-mastering advice" in a hundred texts dances around it and focuses instead on mood and superficial style, with few exceptions. Existing solutions are guesses, tacit interjections, tacit impositions, and often desperation measures.</blockquote>
Emphasis mine.<br/><br/>Look at the language: 'how it's supposed to get anywhere or accomplish anything'.  This implies that if a scene is being played out, <i>ipso facto</i> that scene must be 'going somewhere' and 'accomplishing something'.  This is at the heart of <i>narrative</i> RPG play - not <i>all</i> RPG play.  In RPG play closer in style to, say, GTA III - what I'd call <i>environmental</i> play - the players are making decisions within an environment loaded with play potential.  In that mode of play, Ron's idea of 'murk' is pointless, since the purpose any given scene is <i>existential</i> - the scene is its own means and end.<br/><br/>Through what Ron's writing, it's clear that he has no use for something like 'traditional' dungeon delving  - with the players moving their characters through an environment.  Or rather, not a mode of play where the in-between bits of dungeon delving are played out.  In the murkless dungeon, it's: ENTRANCE, MONSTER, MONSTER, TRAP, ANGSTY DIALOGUE, TRAP, DIALOGUE, [...], FINAL BOSS; with every scene being played being a significant, driving event.<br/><br/>Again, a perfectly valid mode of play - but what needs to be recognized here is that Ron's talking about a very specific mode of narrative play, and not a general end-state that all play should eventually reach.  In other words - there are modes of play that are <i>intentionally murky</i>.<br/><br/>And to address <i>PTA</i>: That's another game that is very fiercely narrative.  Every character a scene, every scene a purpose.  This is because it's emulating another narrative mode, the television show.  And so it fits within the murkless ideal.                        </div>

                            Again we get back to the fundamental assumption of a ton of Forge theories, that if you just play and don't really worry too much about How Horribly Impossible It Is (or whatever the capitalized phrase du jour is), having fun is like hitting the jackpot in the lottery, and playing for that fun is just as silly as playing the lottery and expecting the jackpot.  The quote above is perfectly illustrative, so is the "brain damage" quote, so are a hundred other quotes within the theory essays. If you aren't aware, and you have fun, it's some kind of bizarre accident and you can't count on it happening.<br/>
<br/>
Logically, then, people who value immersion, who are intentionally UNaware of such things during play are inherently destructive and selfish, and as a result are given short shrift at best in any such theory which has this underlying assumption, Forge-y or not.<br/>
<br/>
For the rest of us, who have had more or less happy play experiences and never bought any of the theory nonsense that's come down the pike from GDS on, it rings hollow and false.<br/>
<br/>
Not being a designer, I can't really comment on the question of how it might help design. Me, were I to design a game, I'd design it for what I like.                        </div>

Again - only if you're worried about a cohesive narrative do either of those questions need to be answered.  Otherwise you're just setting off for the dungeon together, and the backstory and/or rationale be damned.
<blockquote>Is any of that in the D&amp;D manuals?  No.  These things are coping mechanisms drawn out from modules at best, but mostly by word of mouth trying to cover up the fact that those basic questions are unanswered.

It's really not, if all you're doing is going on a dungeon delve.  If you're in a campaign, you can work out the various meetings in the first couple of sessions (or hey, do it before hand!).  And with the advent of the v.3.5 books, I wouldn't lay even money on the DMG not having some sort of 'getting things started' section.  If we're going to talk about D&amp;D of yore, that's fine - but D&amp;D of now is likely much less murky on such points.  If you want to come up with good comparisons, you'll probably want to use games contemporary to each other.  Saying 'the games now are less X than Twilight 2000' is a no-brainer.

Well - yes.  Individuality can be a bit of a snag like that.  I just don't see how game design can minimize something like 'getting to know your players'.                        </div>

                            [To elaborate on Chris]<br/>Getting rid of the murk in a dungeon-crawl without it turning to chess:
<blockquote><b>Beginning your first delve.</b> The characters are going to need to need a rationale to work together. These are three tried and tested options:<br/><br/>1a. Each player should write down either a relationship between their PC and another, or a desire that only another PC can help them achieve. Once character generation is complete, this is subject to review by the GM.<br/>1b. The first part of the adventure will then be 'group formation'. This is a scene or a series of scenes where the indidivuals are brought together by special circumstances and the ties that connect them (think of the Magnificent 7 or Ocean's 11 for this). <br/>2.  The characters are part of a unit from the beginning - an elite black ops team, a sect of believers, or a revolutionary organisation. You could employ a short version of step 1b or simply cut to a meeting of the group.<br/>3. The characters meet through happenstance, but in a way that forces them to recognise the merits of acting as a team. They could all turn up to loot the dungeon simultaneously, and find strength in numbers; a character might be battling out of the dungeon after an aborted raid, and the other recognises that their first hand experience will be vital.<br/><br/>We strongly recommend you choose one of these options or have a clear and articulated idea of an alternative. For an experience of real and immersive play (the play that Angels of the Earth hopes to give you) it's vital that where the PCs are and who they are with makes sense.</blockquote>
This should not be 'expert GM' advice picked up by trawling the web or Dragon magazine. This is fundamental information for the fun play of the game. Sure, you can come up with it from the top of your head, just as you could come up with the movement rules to Cluedo if they are omitted. Why should you? It also has nothing to do with supporting a narrative-only style of play [edit: what I meant was <i>thematic play</i>; I'm not sure what narrative-only is.].                        </div>

                            I think the OP is nonsense, to be blunt.<br/><br/>Can better understanding lead some people to better gaming?  Undoubtedly.<br/><br/>Does it follow that better understanding necessarily leads to better gaming, of course not.<br/><br/>Firstly, there is an assumption that the players are interested in a theme.  In most groups I doubt that, the players are likely to be there for a variety of reasons, only some of which may be caught by the concept of theme, and such themes as interest them may not be common to each other or even consistent moment to moment.<br/><br/>Creating interesting challenges and creating an interesting world are things that are routine to decent gaming, most groups that are at all stable and having fun manage this, only some give any thought at all to theory.  Logically, it must follow that theory is not necessary to fun.<br/><br/>Can theory help fun?  For some people sure, particularly if you are not having fun and are having trouble working out why.  Is theory necessary to fun?  No, if it were our hobby would not exist.  People play for fun, a very small number are even aware of the theories out there, if theory were needed for fun the people without knowledge of theory would not be having fun and so would not play. <br/><br/>Would everyone have more fun with more theory?  I sincerely doubt that, people are already having plenty of fun.  Some might have more with theory, but as I think Joshua posted in another thread recently people have different learning models and only some benefit from preverbalising activities in this way.<br/><br/>This murkiness is a chimera, created in the main by people who were not having fun and found theory helpful in finding out why and then make a false generalisation from their unfun experiences to other people's fun experiences.  It's an error of extrapolation, a dead end.  I'm glad those guys found a way to fun, that makes this a useful endeavour for those people and others in their situation, but it is an error to extrapolate that to the experiences of people who never faced that particular problem.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite>Is any of that in the D&amp;D manuals? No. These things are coping mechanisms drawn out from modules at best, but mostly by word of mouth trying to cover up the fact that those basic questions are unanswered. For a game built around the idea of the party going on an adventure together, that's some important stuff to leave unstructured. (see my Chess comparison above).</blockquote>
Coping mechanisms seems a rather pejoratitive way of putting it, all this is is coming up with in game reasons for doing stuff.  Structuring this for many groups would not be helpful, as a key part of the fun of roleplaying for many is coming up with this stuff.<br/><br/>This is the meat of the game, the stuff that many of us do not want rules for as this is why we play.  Calling it a coping mechanism simply misses the point.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bankuei</cite>This is why it's commonplace to run into clashes of preference and "style"- people are wading through the murkiness, trying to see if the game is actually the game they're looking for. Playing the "same" game with different people is a blind date, because key elements are unstructured, unspoken, and discovered through trial and error.<br/><br/>Chris</blockquote>
I'm not persuaded this is nearly as commonplace as is often assumed.  And for such a blind date, it is surprising that so many people manage to have fun so consistently.  This comes close to that old canard that most people are not having fun, which is frankly silly.                        </div>

D&amp;D v.3.5 DMG, p. 130: The Adventuring Party.<br/><br/>It has almost exactly what Alex wrote above - eerily so.<br/><br/>This isn't a 'gotcha' on Alex or Chris, BTW.  What I'm getting at here is that I think that people are working with, ironically, a <b>murky</b> perception of what 'traditional' RPG texts contain these days, and what they actually DO contain.  In other words, maybe people playing traditional RPGs aren't quite as lost as we might think.                        </div>

                            I'm quite agnostic as to whether trad game x or y has this kind of information (but it's interesting to see that the Grand Old Dame prospectively took my advice!); I was contesting the point that clearing the murk meant stripping the game: to me, it means <i>supporting</i> the game at<i> more</i> stages. I definitely wouldn't stop at what I wrote above - each option should be decompressed into various substages. I mean, this is vital stuff - how do you actually play the game!<br/><br/>I stopped gaming for a long time, not because it was bad or evil but because it was fumbly and halting and I often couldn't figure out how to extract the pay-off I could see hovering in the adventure/setting*. The kind of things that would really throw me were not so much the getting together - even then, there was some limited support and it's not the hardest thing to kludge - but certain kinds of progress in-game. Example (not a single actual play but a repeated occurence across them):<br/><br/>Some old Cthulhu adventure: "Herbert Blockwaithe is dead and rotting in his basement. At some point the players should realise this; there are shovels around the back of the house and it will take an afternoon to dig him up." or "Donald O'Keefe is possessed by his dead wife. He will help the group but will seek an opportunity to undermine them (sabotaging the water supplies, emptying their gunchambers), even killing them."<br/>Now, some of you may see these as simple bad scenario writing. Others might see them as supple springboards for introducing and shaping the fiction. I would look at them and simply be unsure as to what to do. How do you sabotage the water supply? Do you have to say "ok everyone, donald gets up and starts to walk off to the west side of camp...do you do anything?" or "ok everyone, donald goes away and comes back. His hands are wet" or "ok, just be aware that over the 3 hours trekking through the woods you don't always have sight of each other -is that ok?" or simply "you check the water cannisters and they are all empty"? Is one or more of these options cheating? They all have a very different impact upon the process and outcome of play - but my decision to employ one or other is not supported by the rule-set. I think this is the murk, and I think most games are still pretty murky. <br/><br/>*The reason this never got evil or bad was because our social contract was always pretty tight and we didn't have unrealistic expectations. We generally had fun, but the fun was a level riding over the gaming as much as was due to it.                        </div>

I don't see that so much as bad scenario writing, as why I play.<br/><br/>I don't want the game to tell me that I have to spoil the water supply and this is how, suggesting options like that is useful in case I get stumped and need a hint, but the reason I play is to see what stuff the players come up with and what I come up with in return, working out how in game to deal with the need to sabotage that supply is part of what I play for.<br/><br/>If the game told me how to do it, worse yet if it encouraged doing it in a certain way, I wouldn't play.<br/><br/>Now, that in no way makes you wrong.  You are right to seek what you find most useful, but tastes vary and for me that uncertainty isn't murk, it's the freedom to play as I wish.<br/><br/>If as a GM I'm running Donald, then that need for me to improvise how he sabotages things is part of what makes GMing fun for me, again, I really do not want that laid out for me.  If a computer could run the encounter following the steps in the book then it has no interest to me.<br/><br/>Now, the thing is, one man's support is another's fetters on freedom of action.  Many indie games provide great support, but for me I find too many of them take out the freedom of action that key to why I play.  That support becomes a fetter for me, and so not fun.<br/><br/>That doesn't make those bad games, that doesn't mean I don't get them or the guys who want that support are wrong to want it, it just means that different people want different things from gaming and that what I want may not be what you want.<br/><br/>The answer with rpgs to how you play the game is pretty much how you want to, that doesn't work for everyone but for many that is precisely why they play.  At the risk of delving into GNS, it's about the right to dream for a lot of people and too much guidance/support can get in the way.<br/><br/>Edit:  To be clear, I recognise Alex's concerns as a genuine issue that merits addressing, I'm just of the view that what for some is an issue is for others a strength because the hobby is so broad that people with quite different requirements can end up thinking they are doing the same thing when really they aren't and when the tools they respectively need may be very different.  System does matter and all that.                        </div>

Definitely, GNS is a side issue here, a tool for helping address particular types of problems.<br/><br/>If the group want to get together to play something light hearted, work off some stress and roll a few dice then delivering that is not really a GNS issue, it's not something GNS is really aimed at helping with.<br/><br/>If the group want to get together to tell a story with power and significance but find that for some reason it's not gelling and the rules seem not to be doing what people want them to, then that is an area where GNS might help.  It might help them understand why those rules aren't helping get that effect.<br/><br/>GNS theory is a tool, like all tools it works best when applied to relevant problems, applying it wholesale is a bit like using a hammer to turn a screw.  Not all problems in gaming are problems to which GNS is relevant and if the problem getting in the way of fun in a particular group isn't a CA driven problem then GNS probably is not the best tool to apply, assuming of course that you are even having a problem in the first place.  If you're all having fun then suddenly applying diagnostic tools seems more a distraction than a valuable activity, like unscrewing the back of your TV which is working fine to see if you can improve the picture.                        </div>

                            Ah, I read the original thread, this is another of those most people aren't having fun things isn't it?<br/><br/>I disagree with the premise, I think that the most basic and obvious truism is that if people were not in general having fun they wouldn't participate in the hobby.  There isn't a drive to game and then we compensate for crappy rules in various ways so that we can game, people game because they enjoy it.  Simple as that really.<br/><br/>The issue here is about why we play, and do we all play for the same reasons.  I don't think we do.  I think some of us want collaborative storytelling rules and rpgs are the nearest thing to that, but do a lousy job of that.  I think for most though that is not so much an issue, the problem isn't that the rpgs don't work as that they don't work for what some people wish to do with them but are close enough to be bloody frustrating.<br/><br/>So, some people play rpgs because they want a tool for collaborative story generation, but rpgs are bad at that as by and large that is not what they are for so they don't have as much fun as they could be having.  The answer to that is not that the rpgs are flawed but that a new type of rpg is needed to meet that particular goal, something more like PTA.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean people can't enjoy both at different times or that there isn't crossover, but I think the fundamental error in that thread is that Ron is trying to use rpgs for something that ultimately they are not designed for and as a result is failing to get the results he wishes.                        </div>

The idea that we need to understand theory to get good play is nonsense, but the OP wasn't saying that and so I was unduly harsh on it.  Sorry Judson.                        </div>

                            See, I don't want it reduced to a computer game. I don't want to squish the right to dream. Hell, the dream was maybe what I was playing for all those years ago. The point is, that character gen and resolution mechanics are not sufficient to play a game. There is a lacuna, that some groups learn to fill effectively, and some less so. But there doesn't need to be.<br/><br/>In my example, it's not that I wanted to be told when and where to spoil the water, I wanted to know procedurally how to make that happen. There is a technique you could use at one extreme: don't address the act in the fiction, but make some kind of alertness roll to determine whether it happened or not. At another extreme, you could play a 3-hour hike out in real time, and identify if there were times when all the characters were so occupied as to not notice the water-spoiling. I doubt either of these is satisfactory to either of us - the first feels very mechanical and fixed, and the second unwieldy and boring.<br/><br/>To deal with it another way, you have to fall somewhere between - not representing all of the hike, but bringing out some aspects of it into the fiction for everyone to play with. You have to draw upon some specific set of techniques (e.g.: frame a scene, introducing an external threat such as a chasm to cross, monitor actions and time elapsed and assess whether the spoilage could have occurred), a set of principles (if he doesn't get a chance to do it here, will I introduce another scene to try the same, or is that hosing the players?) and assumptions (is it fair to assume that the players won't discover this until we make camp? Should I be asking if they want to refresh their canteens?). The actual approach and its outcome are totally up to the imagination. It's the process I'm talking about. And it needn't be something that is harped on and on about - a few simple rules can apply across all situations.<br/><br/>I think this stuff is really important. I imagine that others agree, but reckon what I'm talking about is simply being a good GM; in my view, the game should be offering support that allows you to be a better GM - not as an option, not as advanced rpg styles - but as a fundamental. Some of it can't be explicitly procedural - <i>of course</i> you have to be attuned to your group and their unique set of preferences - but you need to be armed with the play processes that give you the possibilities. Of course, rule 0 is a process, of a kind: "your water is gone. It must have been when you crossed a chasm a while back." "what chasm? anyway, we always keep an eye on our supplies!" "Well, you must have taken your eyes off it for a second", but I don't think a particularly satisfying one.                        </div>

                            Ok - I'm sorry - I've lost track.  What games are we calling 'murky' here?  Ron's post talks about the problem chronologically - games didn't attack murk, then some later on did, and now current Forge games are finally getting at it.<br/><br/>So it seems to me that he's saying that older game texts don't promote play agendas, but current ones do.  Which is no big surprise, since RPGs now have more years under their belts, at least one or two generations of new writers working with some perspective on the creation of smarter game texts, and things approaching theoretical underpinnings of what the hell it is we're trying to create.                        </div>

                            Me? I am specifically referring to trad games I played in my youth and make no claims about newer games in that vein. I find that many indie games are substantially less murky (such as this technique: free play introduces colour and some fictional positioning but things can only permanently happen through a mediated conflict resolution process) but I wouldn't suggest that they are totally 'clear'.                        </div>

Ah, well, now you've gone and made me agree with you.<br/><br/>More seriously, we're on the same page with this, I agree that by and large this advice could be far better and the tools given to GMs are often poor or on occasion actually unhelpful.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I see that as an issue of murk, but leaving that aside I see better what you mean and agree that more could be done to help people on this front.  That said, to me it is more a question of solid advice than rules, but we may agree on that too.  Rules can sometimes do it, but advice I tend to think is a better tool if the advice is well written, which sadly is often a big if.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kuma</cite>In RPG play closer in style to, say, GTA III - what I'd call<i>environmental</i>play - the players are making decisions within an environment loaded with play potential.  In that mode of play, Ron's idea of 'murk' is pointless, since the purpose any given scene is<i>existential</i>- the scene is its own means and end.<br/><br/>Through what Ron's writing, it's clear that he has no use for something like 'traditional' dungeon delving  - with the players moving their characters through an environment.  Or rather, not a mode of play where the in-between bits of dungeon delving are played out.  In the murkless dungeon, it's: ENTRANCE, MONSTER, MONSTER, TRAP, ANGSTY DIALOGUE, TRAP, DIALOGUE, [...], FINAL BOSS; with every scene being played being a significant, driving event.<br/></blockquote>
Again, I have to completely disagree.  Murklessness has nothing to do with strucuture.  It has to do with understanding who contributes what and *why*.  When I play GTA I understand that the content is there for me to riff off the environment.  When I play GTA I don't try start up a Pretty Woman style drama with one of the prostitutes.  But going into the game I know that.  If I don't know that and I try to start up a Pretty Woman style drama with one of the prostitutes (assume this in an RPG context) and all the other players who seem to be "in the know" magically look at me funny and tell me I'm not "playing right" but I don't understand why.... then that's murk.<br/><br/>Similar with dungeon adventures.  Murkless D&amp;D is: You are a party of adventurers who go on quests frought with small scale tactical obstacles.  Brilliant.  Clear.  I know why there are dungeons and I know why there are dragons.  I know I'm supposed to explore the environment looking for traps and monsters and treasures.  No murk.  Perfectly fine.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>I'm going to disagree with Judson too:<br/><br/><i>It seems to me that one of the basic principles of role-playing theory is that the more concretely we understand what we're doing, the better our play will be.</i><br/><br/>No, the more concretely we understand what we want as a table in gathering to play game X, the better our play will be.</blockquote>
But see, in that case, you are agreeing with me.  I think.  I was suggesting (and quite possibly setting up a straw man to do it) that theory suggests that it should be used directly at the table to improve the result of play, which I'm seeing as a hindrance, the same way that trying to do kinematics equations in your head while shooting hoops would be a hindrance.  Honestly, I don't think that "theory" does that, but I've seen theory raised in the midst of play, I've been victim to the error of considering theory in play, and I've read GNS jargon (and maybe jargon from other theories, which I didn't recognize) used (and sometimes mis-used) in RPG texts, and I'll contend that while it might beneficial for theory to influence practice, it doesn't belong in the course of practice.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>I should add actually, when I said the OP was nonsense that wasn't right.  I had Judson's post, the ideas Judson was referring to and Jud's later post mixed up mentally.  The idea that we need to understand theory to get good play is nonsense, but the OP wasn't saying that and so I was unduly harsh on it.  Sorry Judson.</blockquote>

                            Judson, I'm going to go out on a limb here, and guess that maybe. . .just maybe. . .you're saying your post was inarticulate? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Seriously, this thread is becoming tangled; I'd like to try to unravel the strands a bit.<br/><br/><b>First</b>, we have the issue that Murk as defined by Ron in the Forge thread is not the same as what Judson's talking about. So right off we've got two conversations going on.<br/><br/><b>Second</b>, there's this idea creeping (or perhaps charging full tilt) in here that this is a "Versus" concept, divided into camps like "trad" and "indie," or "fun" and "not fun."<br/><br/><b>Third</b>, there's just people talking past each other in general.<br/><br/>On the <b>First Point:</b> With Ron-Murk, "Clear Procedures" are not the same as "we have a rule or mechanic for everything that happens in play." Just whatever procedures there <i>are</i>, they should be <i>clear</i>. I submit, Max, that your stated preference is NOT Ron-murk, but rather a particular aligning of procedural preferences for your desired playstyle. Murk is not "we have rules for A and B, and for C we just decide informally as it comes up." Murk is Person 1 going in thinking there are rules for C, and wondering with shock and confusion why Person 2 just skipped right past any rules-procedure and decided C informally.<br/><br/>Regarding Judson-murk--whether to invoke/consciously apply theory at the table--I think there's a misunderstanding of theory (<i>theory</i> theory, nut just RPG theory) going on here. A lot of folks are talking as if people who "just play,"without thinking through their processes or techniques (and have fun) are not "using" theory. But theory, inasmuch as it is a description of how something works, is in operation regardless of the knowledge of the practitioner. A self-taught guitarist may play a chord progression, having NO idea what the explanation in Music Theory is for that collection of sounds and why it produces a desired result. He just knows it sounds sweet, and sounds sweeter than it would if he played some different progression. That guitarist is applying theory. Even folks like me who <i>have</i> studied music theory, when we sing or play we aren't by and large thinking, "OK, now the piece is concluding, so I'm singing the root of a V to I chord, creating a Perfect Cadence." We just do it, and maybe afterward think, "Man, that Perfect Cadence is sweet!" And in fact, that's how Music Theory developed, from people looking at different collections of sounds and noting which ones were most pleasing and satisfying to the ear.<br/><br/>Same with RPG theory. If you hear Ron talk about his old Champions play (the <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20623.0" rel="nofollow">videos</a> Settembrini has up at the Forge are fascinating!), he describes striving toward Narrativism and utilizing techniques to that end, long before he knew what "narrativism" or the Big Model or anything else was. Formulating the theory helped him identify what that "itch" was he was trying to scratch, and develop techniques to get it more satisfyingly and consistently. So I think the dichotomy being erected of "apply theory at the table" and "just play and have fun" is a false one. By all means, just play and have fun--and if you're having trouble with some specific part of the fun, there may be a technique (Forge or otherwise) to help you. Implementing it may seem awkward the first few times, but with practice it can become as fluid and internalized as your previous palette of techniques.<br/><br/><b>Second</b>, on the "us vs. them" thing: this is a total red herring, and one that's taking up much of the debate. This isn't a case of "our awesome mirkless indie games" vs. "Your stupid mirkful trad games."  At least that's not how I read Ron's comments. Yes, he says that a lot of older games are more mirky, but as someone said, that's just to be expected in the case of a developing artform. Yes, many indie games are crystal-clear about play procedure. We can endlessly debate the reasons for that, but it's not a technique only suited to narr-facilitating (or "story creation", or whatever) games. As has been pointed out, D&amp;D 3E apparently has clearly defined procedural options for framing the "adventuring party" to the dungeon. I was looking at the new Marvel RPG in a store yesterday and it seems to have excellent procedural support, including three play styles, "Power and Responsibility" (Theme-based), "Clobberin' Time" (fun, bitt-kickin' stories), and "Brawlin'" (story-free, one on one battle). This is something that any type of game with any kind of goals can benefit from having--particularly so that it may communicate those goals, instead of leaving it to individual groups to be hopefully on the same page.<br/><br/>Also, murk isn't necessarily a matter of game design. For instance, in a group of D&amp;D players, maybe one of them (me, for instance) hasn't read the DMG, and is unaware of the text on forming adventuring parties, so when the DM and other players use a technique outlined in there (like, I dunno, assuming the PCs are already a group, or having them meet in a bar and expect them to team up), then my expectations, such as "forming a party artificially is so trite and cliche; characters should move and interact freely and naturally without the expectation of forming a team" is going to clash with the group. If I was told what to expect beforehand, I could decide whether I want to play, and if so align myself with the group mode.<br/><br/>The point from a game design perspective is that if I outline procedure clearly in my text, at least I can say I've done <i>my</i> part. There could still be murk within a play group based on differing assumptions, and various distributions of textual knowledge (i.e. "only the GM reads the GM section," or my situation in my childhood Marvel Super-Heroes group, where only one player had read the book because he owned it).<br/><br/>(cont.)                        </div>

<b>Third</b>, regarding talking past each other, I hope that my above commentary helps clear things up. I <i>will</i> particularly weigh in on the "Forgies say gamers aren't having fun" issue, since it seems to be a big culprit in preventing folks from hearing each other. The defensiveness on this issue perplexes me somewhat. No, nobody likes to be told that their favorite activity isn't fun, but I don't think that's what's happening. I don't hink Ron or Vincent or anyone else that <i>I've</i> ever heard from the Forge's core ever say that "most" gamers aren't having fun. They've perhaps said that <i>many</i> gamers aren't having fun. Which is true. I'm not prepared to speculate on the proportion across the hobby, but it is a phenomenon which effects what I would claim is at least a non-negligible segment of total RPG players. The constant reiteration of "but gamers ARE having fun" has a teeth-gritted quality to it and makes those of us who DO have problematic gaming experience (in my case at least) feel a bit marginalized, like our experience doesn't count compared to the apparently VAST LEGIONS of gamers who are having wonderful, perfect game fun. Like, OK, you're having fun, we get it; now can you just let us dysfunctional types keep working out our problems and how to solve them?<br/><br/>Also, I don't think we're talking about a binary switch, twin states of "fun/notfun". It's more like a sliding scale. So someone could be having total fun or total crap, but someone could also be having Moderate or even Pretty Good fun. And if your fun is pretty good right now, what if it could be even better? The issues of procedural clarity and theory application can speak to this player as much as to the player of Total Suck. The only one that it can't help is the person whose play is awesomely perfect and unimprovable, but that person doesn't need help anyway, right? So where's the controversy?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>PS Sorry 'bout the length. I just had a lot to say.                        </div>

<br/>
Just look at Ron's quote up the thread. There's two dozen other quotes I can point to along the same lines. It leads right to what I've described.  If you're having fun without theory, it's by some bizarre random chance, because no one's ever told you what you're doing and therefore you don't know. I agree this is nonsense. But it is the direct, logical consequence of the statements being made. Conclusion: the statements being made are nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
I get what people are saying. If you are having problems with your game or not getting what you want out of it, it really doesn't help for others to be shrugging their shoulders at you and saying "Well, my game's cool, it must be something wrong with you." That's bullshit and maddening.<br/>
<br/>
But similarly if you are in fact having fun with your game, for someone to say, "Well, the game you're playing leads to ongoing power struggles so you must not REALLY be playing it, you must be unconsciously compensating somehow otherwise you'd be miserable." or "You're selfish for wanting to play immersively and all that fun you're having means everyone else is miserable and justifiedly hates you no matter what they say or how much fun they seem to have." or  "Your ability to tell stories is damaged by your game, la, have fun breaking your mental and social legs." is equally bullshit and maddening.                        </div>

Huh. Apparently the "extrapolate the argument to its logical conclusion" game doesn't play both ways.

I'm just perplexed. I just don't see where you're getting these attitudes. Really. OK, I know what the last one is a paraphrase of (and I ain't going there), but the others. . .well, let's just stick to the one thread. I think that's a good idea. So Ron said "textual clarity and gamer understanding of play procedures has been murky for a long time, and designs have finally starting to break new ground in achieving that clarity." And from that you're getting, "you're not really having fun," or a variation thererof? I mean, seriously. If you were/are part of a gaming group that never had clashes or hiccups or bitter hard-feelings disputes over what procedures are in effect, then great. You were probably all clear on what you wanted, or else just didn't speak up/let it show, or yeah, maybe you did just get lucky. I think Ron's point would be that odds are the text you were using (if we're talking olden days, say 80s-90s) didn't support clarity of procedure, so in that sense, you did just luck into it, yeah. And odds ALSO are that your buds and you with your <i>clear understanding</i> would have a problem playing with the group 2 doors down, because <i>their</i> "clear understanding" is way different from yours. None of this is saying "you fun is bad" or "if you enjoy doing that you're deluded." Could be fun; could be WAY fun. But the murk concepts, like so many of the Most-Maligned Forge Statements (MMFS), is geared toward helping straighten things out if this IS a problem for your game.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm getting cranky and tired, and just plain frustrated. I think I've made myself as clear as I can (though I'm too sleep-deprived perhaps to judge), so I'll retire and hope for clearer discourse tomorrow.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>

                            Oh, hey!  I've got an interesting thought.  I think this whole "Forge theorists say that mainstream gamers don't have fun!" thing may grow out of an entirely different concept clash.<br/><br/>Here, I'll say something:  "Mainstream gamers, by and large, do not think about their gaming in the structured, abstract way that theorists do."<br/><br/>Uncontroversial, right?  Non-theorists don't think about theory.  Almost a tautology!<br/><br/>Now add to that <i>one</i> assumption:  "Thinking about gaming in a structured, abstract way can add to your fun."<br/><br/>Now things get interesting, right?  Now you have to conclude:  "Mainstream gamers, by and large, do not reap the benefits of thinking about their gaming in the structured, abstract way that theorists do."<br/><br/>Ooooh ... a little more controversial, isn't it?  It's sort of hard to even <b>say</b> that statement without making people wonder "Hey!  Did he just say that I'm not having fun playing my game?  Or at least that I could be having more fun if I thought the way he did?"<br/><br/>And yet, whether you agree or disagree, surely it's not <i>surprising</i> that folks interested in theory think it's useful, right?<br/><br/>So, anyway, no grand solution, just a little insight that was new to me.  Maybe it'll be new to you.  If you've been looking at statements by theorists about how non-theorists play, double-check what they're actually saying.  Are they saying "You're not having fun?" or are they saying "You're not doing theory?"                        </div>

                            Yep, Tony got it. I knew he would. The part of the quote I was looking at was right before the bolded section: "Historically, role-playing is practically defined by a bunch of techniques hidden or at least isolated within a bunch of unconstructed dialogue. When I say "unconstructed," I don't merely mean "not rolling dice," and not even "open dialogue." I mean: primal chaos that cannot itself produce a solution (in the technical sense of that term)."<br/>
<br/>
Primal chaos with no solutions? That's my Vampire game? Fucking A! I thought it was a great game! Oh well, I guess all that fun was just my imagination. After all, the "unconstructed" things I was doing  cannot itself produce a solution.  Only the "constructed" theory could have saved me.                        </div>

                            Tony, <br/><br/>Sure thing, however the reason I stopped posting directly on GNS was a thread on rpg.net where, when people said they didn't think about theory, one poster kept coming back arguing that they were therefore missing out on increased fun and should investigate theory as otherwise they were limiting their fun.  He basically was saying, you're not having fun, and that led directly to my ceasing to discuss GNS as I just couldn't be bothered to wade through nonsense like that.<br/><br/>So you have a point, and it is a very fair challenge, and sometimes the person is just saying you're not doing theory but sometimes also they're saying you're not having fun because I have pretty much had that said to me.                        </div>

                            I'm going to try to drawn an analogy.  I'm hoping it's not a straw man, and I'm hoping it turns out to be useful.  We'll see.<br/><br/>The vast majority of people don't have a solid grasp of social power dynamics.  They don't understand or think about how we assume roles (teacher, student, parent, child, friend, mentor, whatever), and how the socialized dynamics in those assumed roles impact interaction with other people.  But they assume the roles anyway, and they derive the advantages of power dynamics (which doesn't mean that they have power, sometimes it's an advantage to assume a lower-power position).<br/><br/>I take Ron to be saying the same thing: most people don't understand or think about what's happening when they roleplay.  But they do it anyway, and they derive the fun that comes from doing that sort of thing.  The problem that arises is when people fail to assume complimentary positions.  Think about the chaos that happens when two people try to take the position of 'teacher' in reference to the other in reference to the same subject.  You get social tension and chaos and not much gets done.  I take it that the same thing can happen in roleplaying (it's happened to me at least): you can assume non-complimentary positions and thus have your fun mangled.<br/><br/>Of course a lot of people (most?) don't have any problems with assuming complimentary roles in social power dynamics, and I assume that the same is true of roleplaying.  So my read on any statement about confusion or non-understanding is that it's no big deal.  Most people don't <i>need</i> to understand something to do it.  I can play a game of pick-up basketball and have a lot of fun doing it, but I know pretty much nothing about strategy in basketball.  Would I have more fun playing if I knew some strategy?  Maybe.  Knowing me, probably.  But I don't want to spend the time required to learn it, I've got other stuff to do (like play basketball).<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Yep, Tony got it. I knew he would. The part of the quote I was looking at was right before the bolded section: "Historically, role-playing is practically defined by a bunch of techniques hidden or at least isolated within a bunch of unconstructed dialogue. When I say "unconstructed," I don't merely mean "not rolling dice," and not even "open dialogue." I mean: primal chaos that cannot itself produce a solution (in the technical sense of that term)."<br/><br/>Primal chaos with no solutions? That's my Vampire game? Fucking A! I thought it was a great game! Oh well, I guess all that fun was just my imagination. After all, the "unconstructed" things I was doing  cannot itself produce a solution.  Only the "constructed" theory could have saved me.</blockquote>
Except you've taken what he said out of context and drawn a conclusion from it that doesn't make sense in context.<br/><br/>I think the logical conclusion to draw from it is this one: if your game text doesn't explain the elements and procedures of play, and your game is successful and fun, then THE GROUP must have established the elements and procedures of play.<br/><br/>So Vampire doesn't explain all those procedures. So what? Burning Wheel doesn't either. There are LOADS of things that are not explained in Burning Wheel, like how to set a scene, what a scene is, when a scene begins, when a scene ends, who gets to narrate a success, who gets to narrate failure, how to add complications as a result of failure, and even how to build a campaign! That doesn't mean it's a bad game or that no one who plays it has fun. In fact, Ron himself quite likes it, even if it is "murk-ful"<br/><br/>The fact remains, when we sit down to play Burning Wheel, there are procedures and techniques that we use that are not in the text. If we successfully play a game, we have dealt with that issue and gotten rid of Ron's murk. For ourselves. And that's just fine.<br/><br/>But aware play, in which we watch and analyze what we do and why, and what effects we cause, can allow us to design games that make those procedures and techniques part of our designs. And if done correctly, the players of those games won't need to know anything about theory because it will already be embedded in the game.<br/><br/>So that's the big, evil point that Ron and others have about theory: Looking at your play that is fun and trying to understand the principles behind what made it fun, and looking at your play that is not fun and trying to understand the principles behind what made it not fun, can help you design better games if you apply those principles.<br/><br/>And since we will never get to the point where all games are totally clear about how to play, if a group is not having fun, if communication is breaking down or someone is not getting everything they want out of play, those people have the option to use aware, analyzed play to figure out why, and maybe make it better. Or, with just as much validity, they could stop engaging in a hobby they don't enjoy.                        </div>

                            All right, I've officially spent all the energy I can afford to on this thread. I've said my piece (and a half), I've made my points, it's out of my hands.
