Also, it's been published under Creative Commons:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.eclipsephase.com/cclicense" rel="nofollow">Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike</a> (at the E.P. page)<br/><br/>In short: You can download it for free.<br/>You can create your own material for it, and publish it (for free; you can't make any money off of it)<br/>You can use and "remix" all of the art in the book for your own purposes, with the exception of five select pieces of art.<br/><br/>I don't know if this will create a revolution or anything, but I think it's really, really cool.<br/><br/>For example, I was poking through the game and I thought:<br/>1) I don't like psi stuff in my hard SF.<br/>2) They need to crank up the Greg Egan level from "2" to "6": More stuff with personality-splitting. Less consequences for re-incorporation.<br/>3) The system is encumbered by too much percentile crap for my own interests.<br/><br/>Well, basically, under the CC license I can add my own houserules, redesign the system, add bits that I want (fanmail!), and republish the thing with all the art (save five pictures), print a few copies for me and my friends, and throw down.<br/><br/>Anyway, that sold me on the corebook (not to mention that Adam Jury worked on it, so for me that's pretty much a sell; I'm a fan of his work). And I'm interested to see that, in two years, if we'll be running into each other at cons with a personal print copy of a book under our arms, asking each other "So, what does <b><i>your</i></b> Eclipse Phase look like?"<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228878/#Comment_228878" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T07:30:49+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  7:30AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The part that interests me is this: considering that you were attracted by the CC license, are you not bothered by the non-commercial and share-alike clauses?

So it probably still is a bit of an edge case, but it isn't like it never happens. And minus the cease and desist letters on legal letterhead, I've also seen folks have problems with fan websites for different games at different times. Hell, there was even kerfuffle over HeroQuest websites just a few years back, while Heroquest was still Indie. (Or maybe just after it wasn't. I dunno, the whole thing confused me.) <br/><br/>And in my experience, it is really damn rare for a fan to do that much work. However, groups of fans working together have done that much work or more over time. There were fan sites for the OWoD, once upon a time, that had enough material to fully replace every published book with an equal amount of fan created material. Which is, yes, probably an edge case but it did happen. <br/><br/>Then there are less edge cases like John Kim's run in with Green Ronin when he wanted to make a freely available .pdf of the OGL parts of Blue Rose. I do not remember all the details, but it was a weird place in open gaming, and folks at Green Ronin got pissed, and John got pissed, and there was some nasty talk about litigation, legality, and whether or not fans should make the open parts of open games freely available and what not. (Actually, that was always a fun little fight around the d20 OGL, as everyone liked to slam their own spin on what "open" meant -- often fully ignoring the license.) <br/><br/>So... yea. I dunno how much this is actually going to generate. It did get me to look at Eclipse Phase, where normally I wouldn't have ever looked at it. (Though I then decided it wasn't a game I wanted.) Which seems a good strategy to get folks in a dedicated niche market to buy expensive books... but that's more about the marketing than the joys of open licensing and CC. For that I look more to TSOY, both where it succeeded (say, Eero's version, which is brilliant) and where it failed (that there aren't more brilliant rewrites of it).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JongWK" title="JongWK"><img alt="JongWK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JongWK">JongWK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229724/#Comment_229724" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T20:17:40+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  8:17PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/>Non-Commercial, I was a little like, "Oh, C'mon, seriously?", as if they were diving into the CC pool at the deep end, but staying within one foot of the ladder Just In Case. </blockquote>\nDo remember that while PHS developed EP, it was CGL that actually published it.

It's just not the sort of thing that would have occurred to me that would be passed. I mean, you don't even need proof? Just accuse 'em and down they go? Wow.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not particularly interested in the debates about the morality or ethics of piracy. I do dig the fact that there's folks out there in the rpg world that think about stuff like this though and have decided to try and deal with the problem of IP ownership and fan contribution through the CC licence thing. I also dig the whole CC licence thing as a potential "my first game design" sort of deal. An awful lot of people doing rpg stuff seem to feel they _must_ design an entirely new system and usually a setting to go along with it. They're trying to build a car before they've even figured out how an engine works.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see the potential for a lot of cool stuff coming from games doing the CC thing. On its own, Eclipse Phase may not be any great thing, but what it _represents_ and the potential outgrowths of it? Totally awesome. And yes, there have been/are other games released under the CC licence. But Eclipse Phase is also trying for the more "traditional gamer" market which is another "big deal" I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
