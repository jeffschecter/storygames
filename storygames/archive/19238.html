"Everybody roleplays"...<br/><br/>So the logical extension to that is that nobody is the GM per se.  Rather, in any given scene, someone takes on roleplaying all the NPCs -- that somebody being the player whose PC is  least involved in that particular scene.  A bit like how Prime Time Adventures has a spotlight character for a particular session, but in reverse.   In each scene , the player whose PC is somehow designated to be the 'anti-spotlight' character relinquishes their PC to be a bit part player (if they are there at all), and instead takes on roleplaying any significant NPCs in the scene, along with other functions that are delegated to the GM in this theoretical system.<br/><br/>So 'GMing' in this fashion doesnt rotate in a clockwork way, but is dependent on the the context of the scene -- whichever player's character is least involved becoems the GM for that scene.<br/><br/>Is there a game that does this already?   whatcha think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428607/#Comment_428607" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-22T03:59:29+00:00" title="February 22, 2014  3:59AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2014 4:02AM by Rickard.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's the purpose of the scene and who states the purpose?

If you're playing a traditional game with a game master that has a prewritten adventure, and one player says "I want to see the herbalist" then that player kind of determines the next scene, right?<br/><br/>When I'm playing "GM-less" games, it's the person who takes the initiative that determines the next scene. Usually it's the same person who frames the scene too. I had moments in games where the task of being a "scene framer" rotates clockwise, but where someone else could suggest a scene. Framing a scene does not make someone a game master, according to me. Determine the purpose of a scene does not make someone a game master. Playing supporting characters does not make someone a game master.<br/><br/>As I can see it, from this perspective that I purposed now, is that a game master is someone with a hidden agenda that the others are about to find out. That's why I (and some people with me) think that a GM-less game need perfect information. The group needs to know all the participants' ideas and every character's agenda so the group can together form the game and frame scenes around it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428611/#Comment_428611" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-22T05:21:23+00:00" title="February 22, 2014  5:21AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2014 5:21AM by stefoid.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep.

Do intermittent GM duties become a mere chore?  Do they interfere with the fun of character play?  If GM-swapping is compatible with a game's other aims, great, consider it a solid option.  But if the game is predicated on challenge-tackling or immersion in character or meta-plots etc., it's probably not a good fit.<br/><br/>I think "why GM?" is a frequently under-explored topic in games, and many of the traditional, unspoken answers actually work best with one GM, period.

These are all interesting questions IMO, so I'd like to see how you would deal with them in your game.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428637/#Comment_428637" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-22T15:56:25+00:00" title="February 22, 2014  3:56PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, Im aware that rotating GMs is and has been a thing for ages. <br/><br/>Many good points in this thread. <br/><br/>The line of thought I was following comes from the philosophy that  'The GM is just another player, roleplaying a bunch of NPCs rather than a single PC'.   So by extending that concept to eliminate the difference between GM and player so that all are just Players that represent a PC and a share ownership of the NPCs.<br/><br/>The problems that everyone has outlined are significant, the worst for me being that shared ownership of NPCs dilutes being engaged with one specific PC.<br/><br/>DreamsAskew Situations / bad guy factions are a nice twist to that because it lets players take sole responsibility for a logical subset of NPCs.  The more I turn that over, the more I like it for lots of reasons.  I wonder if any actual play of that style has resulted in a player abandoning their original PC in favour of a situational 'NPC' that has emerged through play as more interesting/important to the game.

I generally find it is easier for me to shift from being a GM in a  traditional RPG set up to being a player in a GMless game, than it is for me to shift from being a GM in a traditional game to being a player in a traditional game.<br/><br/>Actually, for what I like out of GMing, GMless games really crank up the fun for me and drop the workload involved to almost nothing.<br/><br/>Of course, trad GMing fun for me involves lots of on-the-fly event and character creation, being able to rapidly slip between character portrayals ( usually of characters created on the spot as a response to PC actions), and generally lots of improvising. Plus, as a traditional GM, I get to enjoy the various characters, but I don't have to <i>care</i> about the characters. If one of my NPCs dies or comes to a bad end ( whether through bad luck or their own failings), I have a zillion more available. I can just <i>play</i> them. I never have to worry about them winning in any sense of the word.<br/><br/>Given that point of view, yes, thinking of the overall story, as it is developing, is more what I do anyway. In a GMless game, I usually have 3 or 4 other players also doing the same thing. It's pretty magical actually.<br/><br/>The only downsides I find is that GMless games tend towards some really hairy-dog type stories. It's not nearly as easy to have a complete, cohesive starting point and stick with it ( although notably Archipelago does have some rules that help with that issue).<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidVS" title="DavidVS"><img alt="DavidVS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/nMT00GFQS5U2U.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidVS">DavidVS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428658/#Comment_428658" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-23T07:41:07+00:00" title="February 23, 2014  7:41AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2014 7:50AM by DavidVS.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I feel like perhaps "switch GMs" is sometimes code for "GMing isn't fun, so let's not dump it all on one person".

It <i>is</i> fun, which is why most of my friends and I enjoy taking a turn.  But to distribute the real-life time cost it is nice to rotate with each module, campaign arc, etc.<br/><br/>I do not know of a game in which the GM role rotates each scene/encounter.  But I have seen it happen as a "house rule" in traditional one-GM games such as D&amp;D and Pathfinder.<br/><br/>A few, rare times it happened just because one PC would have minimal involvement and everyone knew the GM would enjoy playing an NPC as a PC: the old GM hands the page(s) of enemy descriptions to someone and asks for a break from controlling the opposition.<br/><br/>More commonly it happened when a play session ended with a PC death -- that PC's player would take over the GM role until the group returned to a location in the game setting where a replacement PC could be recruited in-story (providing real-life time for the Player to carefully construct a new PC).  The old GM would play a new character rescued by the heroes in the dungeon/wilderness early the next session (a temporary PC that could be more wacky because it had no responsibility to mesh well with the party long-term).  Also, the old GM knew inside knowledge of what was coming, but this was reflected by what the rescued captive knew: a player death usually meant that the enemies had been alerted to the heroes progress and would be adjusting their defenses/plans anyway.<br/><br/>Once it happened just because a PC action derailed the entire prepared adventure.  The GM basically said, "Um, you can do that, but it steers the adventure away from everything I had prepared.
