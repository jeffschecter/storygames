Years later I found out that there were other books detailing all these places, but we didn't have those, we just had an unexplained map.<br/><br/>So we made up what stuff was, we used the map, but attached our own meanings to the things on it.  It was incredibly cool, we'd look at the map and say "Let's go to the Big Rubble, see what that's like" and whoever was running would make up something to be the big rubble.<br/><br/>Traveller was the same.  We hadn't seen anything of Traveller canon, just what was in Book 0 and occasionally referenced in White Dwarf or the magazine for Traveller.  So we made stuff up.  Eventually we got the book with stats for all the systems in some particular subsector, but it told you nothing about the places, so we made up the details for them too.<br/><br/>Both Runequest and Traveller of course had hyperdetailed settings, my love of both died a little when I discovered that.  The implied settings though, those were a spur to our creativity, a starting point that helped spark ideas.<br/><br/>Not sure if any modern games do this, hell those old games didn't mean to do it, but I do think there's something there.  Detail all there is of a setting and you've removed the joy of exploration, and for many of us that's a big deal - I play in large part for that joy.  You've also removed a joy of authorship, you've already authored everything and left me to play in your world (you being used generically here obviously).  Leave the details out though, and while you'll disappoint the completists, setting gurus and collectors out there you'll I think have a more fun and more playable game.<br/><br/>Any thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189530/#Comment_189530" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T07:46:10+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  7:46AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2009 7:49AM by Brand_Robins.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say Burning Wheel does part of this. BW actually has a quite detailed setting -- its just all in the lifepaths, the traits, and the Emotional Attributes. No maps or such, which may be a weakness in this regard, but much of the implication of things is there. <br/><br/>Dogs does it to some degree. Vincent lists some general stuff about the setting, and specific things about the faith -- but much of much of it is left implied and up to the group. However, because Dogs is so focused on the sin and judgment, its been my experience that the kind of development of setting (as opposed to of character) rarely gets to the level that you're talking about. <br/><br/>In A Wicked Age's oracles work almost entirely off of this concept as well. They imply things, and the group brings them to life. IAWA also has you draw maps and shit, so you create the world and explore it as you go. <br/><br/>However, all of these games are doing something different than what I felt Runequest did. Partly its because of a narrative rather than simulation slant (jargon! oh nos!). Partly its because they don't have maps that you don't make yourself. <br/><br/>This may be more important than you'd think. I'm currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Maps-Legends-Michael-Chabon/dp/1932416897/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1232638824&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">Maps and Legends</a> by Michael Chabon (best dust jacket on any book ever), and he has a couple of different essays in which he talks about the importance of maps to the imagination. In particular he talks about unfinished maps, maps of imaginary places, maps of the future or the past, and the ways in which they tease out the mind with their promises of "here be dragons" or "here be zepplins and flying cars." There is something profound in the way that a map teases out the desire to explore, especially along the areas of the map that aren't finished, that are blank, to go running along the borderlands and see where the world we know dissolves into the world we don't.  <br/><br/>A map is a promise: it tells you there are things there, real things -- even if they're real in a world that isn't ours -- and that you could explore those things. An implication of setting: a name, an evocative title, a description of an alien way of life... these do the same thing. They offer the chance to explore, the chance to adventure, the chance to seek, to find, and to sail beyond the sunset or into the nebula of stars. <br/><br/>Exalted 1st did this for me -- with its vast maps and vague sketches of vast and strange lands to be explored. Scavenger Sons filled out individual details of flying mountains and hawk knights, but by being specific and leaving the rest wide open it did a lot to imply around details, giving both color and room to explore. <br/><br/>So, yea. I think we need more maps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189531/#Comment_189531" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T08:06:05+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  8:06AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brand, that's an interesting point about Burning Wheel.  It's very much like Classic <i>Traveller</i> in that the setting is implied in the character creation process, but no setting was provided.<br/><br/><br/>In the Traveller game I'm running, I kept a lot of the standard GDW Third Imperium stuff -- the shape of the Imperium, the Spinward Marches, the political system.... but also gutted it on purpose.  I created new subsectors to replace subsectors from the spinward marches.  <br/><br/>I've mapped two of the subsectors, established political entities at the border of the Imperium, but haven't rolled up all the planets (just five of them in one of the subsectors). The idea is, when the PCs go to different worlds, we'll figure it out as we go...  <br/><br/>You can see the map <a href="http://playsorcerer.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/brillsubsectormap.pdf" rel="nofollow">here.</a>.  Only the named star systems have stats.  That all said, it's strange to have even as much backstory element breathing down my neck.  Lately I've become much more used to filling a setting out as needed.  In fact, in past years I always found the weight on my neck of trying to know "all the stuff" of an established, fictional setting to be overwhelming and an enemy of fun.<br/><br/><br/>Max (and all), what about a GM created map that leaves lots of room for discover.  That is, the GM fills in a sheet of paper with a few towns, a few cities, maybe a political boundary or two, but doesn't do all the details.  Does that spark you the same way?  <br/><br/>This approach touches on what Brand brings up -- they're both evocative, but also have blank portions.  <br/><br/>Both <i>Storming the Wizard's Tower</i> and the setting creation chapter from <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i> have the GM establish settings this way.  The GM sketches out a map... but leaves a lot of room for exploration.  Cool, evocative locations are present (evocative through name or detail), but even the GM might not know exactly what they are yet.  <br/><br/>Is there a difference between being hand a map with un-established details and creating one's own map with un-established details?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189533/#Comment_189533" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T08:10:23+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  8:10AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Shadow of Yesterday explicitly does this: a broad sketch of a world map, a general hand-wave in terms of defining cultures in broad strokes (and with the racial keys and culture-specific abilities), and then you're off to the races.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189539/#Comment_189539" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T08:35:27+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  8:35AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris, <br/><br/>With a GM made map, its going to depend on the specifics of the table. If I really think the GM has made a map but has no or only vague ideas and is honestly and openly willing to go with what we explore together -- then it probably will work in a similar way for me. If I don't really believe that... probably not. <br/><br/>This is one of the reasons why I'm drawn to Storming the Wizard's Tower, btw.<br/><br/>However, for me, there is something else that the smaller maps of Storming, in their context, don't quite do for me. <br/><br/>When confronted with the maps for Storming, you know there is a lot to explore and that you're going to have cool adventures here. You also have the knowledge that you're going to be doing it here. That is, this village is the center of your adventures, the local area your sphere. You will confront, weekly, the monsters the GM has come up with and in so doing learn more about this place and the near surrounding places. <br/><br/>This is all good, mind you. Its practical, its focused, its easy to actually play. It gives coherence, it sets clear expectations, and it still has some of that wonder of joint discovery as you go through things. I like it. <br/><br/>But when confronted with that 1st ed Exalted map of creation with its 800 mile tall mountain, its vast sweep of "here be dragons" unknown, the little thumbnails that we were all given by someone outside us to develop as us... there was a different reaction. It was a "where shall I go?" and "what shall I do?" A real wonder of "what is it like near the southern pole, where there is fire the burns forever, and what people might I meet there?" There was a sense of space, of vastness, of possibility that reminds me of the line from The Shawshank Redemption "I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain."<br/><br/>Sitting down with that map and my first Exalted group, we didn't know who was going to GM, we didn't know where the game was going to start, or what we were going to do. And we felt that once the game did start, no matter what local location was the first scene, that it could explode to anywhere depending on what the characters did. The very act of exploring that map, of seeing the seas of burning sands and the endless icefields with their flying ships and war mastadons 100,000 miles away.. that was a large point of it. <br/><br/>The maps of Storming act as focus. They are the GM giving some initial sketches, so that the rest can be built together, and just as importantly, giving focus. Saying "this is where we will start, this is what we will do." The first edition Exalted map, otoh, gave an initial sketch that none of us had made, which is less intimate but has the benefit of all of us coming to it equally rather than it being the initial creation of anyone at the table, and then rather than focus gave us possibility. the endless scope of infinite adventure. <br/><br/>Now, I know that there are a lot of groups who saw that and floundered. Who because of that could never get the focus to actually play, or have actual play be coherent. But that's part of the danger of freedom, and one I never had any particular problem with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189542/#Comment_189542" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T08:48:42+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  8:48AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>I'd say Burning Wheel does part of this.

[I think the latter is HUGE in any game that has art]<br/><br/>Blossoms Are Falling has a map, a sketchy time line, strong references to the Tale of the Heike and the Tale of Genji, Clan/Temple Burner, lifepaths, skills, traits, emotional attributes, the duel of poetry, etiquette and language rules, and monsters!<br/><br/>Brand, I'm curious if you think the varying tools for conveying implied setting create different results across these products (and also non-Burning products!).<br/><br/>Our idea has been that we engage in a collaborative form of setting creation with the folks who play our games. We prepare the flower beds and offer a selection of seeds and you plant the garden and tend it. I think this approach helps folks invest in the setting and really take an ownership stake in it. It helps everyone who's playing at the table have an intimate knowledge of the setting (at least the part that's pertinent to the game they're playing together).<br/><br/>While I'm a fan of big, expansive settings (I'm a bit of a Gloranthaphile, for instance), my experience in play has been that big settings often fall flat because not everyone at the table invests in the setting equally. I find this to be especially true if getting up to speed on a setting requires reading a bit. Many gamers just won't do it. <br/><br/>A game that plays heavily on the intricacies of Heortling culture is very different depending on whether all the players at the table are devoted Gloranthaphiles or only one or two are.<br/><br/>The really interesting thing about Glorantha, in particular (whether RuneQuest version or HeroQuest version), is that it has both tons of implied setting AND tons of minutely detailed explicit setting. Either one can become an impediment to groups trying to play in Glorantha. <br/><br/>Some groups see all the implied setting and balk. They either don't realize that they are intended to fill in detail around the sketchy information they are provided, or that responsibility turns them off.<br/><br/>Other groups see the reams and reams of written detail about the setting and balk. They think that they need to know everything in order to play it correctly, and aren't interested in doing the work required.<br/><br/>And some groups, of course, are in the happy medium, and find it just right. But for those that aren't in the happy medium, the accumulated lore has become a massive barrier to entry. <br/><br/>I'd love to see more in the way of techniques to overcome that problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189548/#Comment_189548" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T09:11:57+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  9:11AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, it's more than the implied setting, it's the fact that the gaps are filled by everyone as they play.

If I go 1d6 houses down the street from my house, I will find a home in which really interesting things are going on and there's a lot of problems and strengths. That doesn't always happen in detailed settings. Sometimes a setting element is thrown out there and it just sits there like a lump, no way of getting it moving. Other times it's a glass house and a pile of rocks, or a teeter-totter over a lava pit, or any other metaphor for something crazy just about to happen.<br/><br/>This is why I love the Forgotten Realms.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley" title="Jack Aidley"><img alt="Jack Aidley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley">Jack Aidley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189555/#Comment_189555" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T09:26:34+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  9:26AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In one of the best campaigns I ran I asked one of the players to create a map of what they knew about the world, but the player I gave this task ad-libbed all sorts of random stuff onto the map in places they hadn't visited yet.

For my most successful campaign, I had lots of other materials (most of the material published for RQ II and III, plus some other random bits), but most of it didn't get that much use (except we used the map from Trollpak). By not wallowing in the details, the players had some freedom to explore (though I gave lots of direction also). In a more recent campaign, I had tons more material, and things floundered. For one thing, while the presence of the Lunars in Dragonpass and Prax has been solidly there since the beginning (especially with Cults of Prax), trying to use the more recent material felt very constraining.<br/><br/>I'm starting a Burning Wheel campaign, and I've yet to nail down much of the setting. I'm leaning towards using Wilderlands of High Fantasy for my "world" but that in it's own way has too much detail, so I waffle.

But over time, I've grown much less interested in them -- to be honest, I just don't care about maps anymore, the same way I don't care about travel time between locations on a map, the same way I don't care about the details of travel between locations on a map.  I find all that stuff kind of boring now.  Maybe that's because the genre that most easily lends itself to maps, fantasy, is so boring to me...but also, I think that locations just aren't where my interest lies anymore.<br/><br/>What gets my interest now are things like history, and especially the slutty easy cousin who tags along with it named revisionist history.  Give me a capsule list of things that happened, and I can go nuts filling in the details or imagining the larger cultural impacts or concocting elaborate conspiracy theories about why the "official" version is wrong, or whatever.  If a map is a promise of a story to come, then histories are pure fucking story hooks mainlined directly into your carotid artery.  Whether it's vague or hyper-detailed, I can use a history to set up the glass house that we'll spend our gaming sessions throwing rocks at.  Maps promise locations, but histories promise situations, and I can do more with a situation than I ever could with a location.<br/><br/>I can do some fun things with rumors, factions, and cosmologies, too.  Basically, anything that hits characters or plot will grab me easily.  Maps are about landscape, not about people:  they really don't care about characters and suggest no plots.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189593/#Comment_189593" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T11:47:37+00:00" title="January 22, 2009 11:47AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2009 11:54AM by J_Walton.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In some ways, I kinda wish D&amp;D4 was three books of rules, y'know, without any fluff at all, for a similar reason.

This means that if you want a quick-start you can set your game in the tropics - you still have scope to make stuff up but you aren't starting from scratch - but if you want more of a blank slate you can just move north or south and invent things.<br/><br/>It's an attributes-based game, so for each main nationality I give stereotyped attributes for someone from there which hopefully answer the questions "What would be interesting about playing a character from this place?" and "If I meet someone from this place, what are they likely to be like?". (Playing characters against type is explicit advice, though.)<br/><br/>I also try to include a few details in each nation's writeup that are likely to answer the question, "What would be interesting about setting a game here?" and "If we set a game here, what kind of things might happen?"<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/><b>Koskant</b><br/>A tropical river kingdom between the Gulf of Hizmay on the north and the mountains of the Waist on all other sides. The capital, Gulfhead, is an important port, shipping tropical produce from upriver and products from several DWARF clan holds. These are primarily destined for the northwest, since export to the southeast is blocked by the presence of the Corsair Coast.<br/> <br/>Gulfhead has increased in value and importance since the driving of a railway line to connect to the dwarf holds of the north. A notable feature of Gulfhead as a city is that it is built on multiple levels, served by magically levitating skyboats (it sits in a particularly air-magic-rich area).<br/><br/>The domain of Less Koskant has been run by a governor for years, and Koskant has, within the past generation, taken over effective control of (eastern) Hizmay in order to protect its shipping from attack. The King of Koskant, Victor IV, is rumoured to fancy himself as an Emperor, and to be waiting for an excuse to replace the puppet King of Hizmay with another governor (probably the King\u2019s brother) and declare it to be a province of his empire.<br/><br/>Koskant possesses several fleets. The First Fleet, the largest, is based in Gulfhead, the Second Fleet in Less Koskant, and the Third Fleet in Hizmay Port. It is negotiating for access to use a port in Kondenning as a base for the Fourth Fleet, currently under construction in the Gulfhead yards. There are rumours that this fleet, supported by strong elements from the other three, will sail against the Corsair Coast and take Rezinak.<br/><br/>Koskant's emblem is the golden gryphon on a wavy blue background. Gryphons, fierce predatory beasts blended from an eagle and the hindparts of a lion, are found in the mountains on either side of the Gulf of Hizmay. They feed on sharks and sometimes squid, diving from height and snatching these large sea creatures with their eagle claws and beaks. Occasionally they attack shipping if disturbed during the nesting season. King Victor would dearly love to tame some to fight alongside the winged horses of the Montanusi sky cavalry, and anyone bringing this about for him would be very well rewarded.<br/><br/><i>Koskander</i><br/>Prosperous and proud<br/>If not personally involved in shipping or the navy, certainly has relatives who are<br/>Hates the Corsairs<br/>Looks down on Kondenningers as hicks and Hizmayi as whiners<br/>Treats Montanusi and dwarves as respected employees<br/>Religion: Lunar-Asterist <br/>Article of faith: Nobody else is as good as a Koskander<br/>Language: Peqtal; apart from Tradelang, unlikely to have learned any others                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_189615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189615/#Comment_189615" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T13:44:02+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  1:44PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2009 1:44PM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thoughts are that you are on to something essential.

The traits and lifepaths are probably the best in any BW product, producing excellent flavor and a very interesting map of the functional relations of the world. The timeline is interesting, and unlike those "10,000 year timelines that are useless to anyone" it actually does its work of setting up the present situation as something grown out of past conflicts. The fact that it has a map that is distinct, not over detailed, but that still shows clear areas of "here be dragons/pirates/mountain bandits" is a big plus for my brain. <br/><br/>But even bigger is the fact that in Blossoms there is a much bigger and more drawing map -- the map in my head of late classical Japan. I've read a lot of the same fictional inspirations at you guys, and so as I read the book it was easy for that map -- the ever elusive past, the place that we can never go, the farthest and most exotic of horizons, was constantly in my mind. One of the reasons I liked Blossoms more than many other Japanish RPGs was, I think, that the map it makes (both with lifepaths, maps, monsters, and the way the cycles and honor are constructed) makes it the most like the map in my head -- but in ways that also challenge and demand to be played. I mean, BW isn't exactly the world's most fun thing to read, but its the kind of game that pushes for play. <br/><br/>Jihad... Jihad was different. When I read Jihad I thought "Oh, so I can play Dune: Burning Wheel." Which was interesting, but which mostly had a more limited sort of draw for me. I'm not fully sure why that is. Burning Empires had a similar reaction, vis a vis the graphic novels, but seemed more roundly designed. That is to say, I felt more called to play it to make my own Shiva's War, where I didn't feel compelled to play Jihad. But, in all honest, with BE the rules as design were the thing that drew me most. I wanted to understand the game as game more than I cared about the universe it mapped out. <br/><br/>In BE play mapping out the story and universe together becomes fun, but its a different thing than the draw that I'm talking about with big map games, and more like that of Storming or Dogs. I suppose one could say something about "creation" vs "exploration" but I'm not sure how well text would convey the connotation of it. In BE I see a world to create, and rules to explore. Where as in Exalted I saw a world to explore and rules to ignore. <br/><br/>Mouse Guard... I'm not ready to say anything intelligent about Mouse Guard yet. <br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><br/>I agree, but I also get the same feeling from encyclopedias. Possibly we have different balances of visual/textual stimuli in our big ole brains?<br/></blockquote>\nSo we all know what Aristotle said about learning. I do get a similar thing from encyclopedias, an excitement about new knowledge, about far away places. I read, say, William Dalrymple for exactly that reason -- the man has a brilliant gift for pushing at the edges of the map and showing the wonders beyond it. <br/><br/>A big map game that doesn't do it well is close to an encyclopedia -- I get a charge out of reading and seeing these things in my minds eye, but I don't feel any need to actually explore them myself. To daydream, maybe, but to actually get in and explore and engage? Egh.... <br/><br/>However, a big map game that does it well has something that challenged me or draws me into actually wanting to play through the exploration of the world and to do it with my friends. It has to do with gaps, I think. There needs to be those places on the map that say "here be dragons" or "beyond this unknown" -- and not just at the edges of the map. The whole map, or the parts I'm going to play in, need to be littered with those. <br/><br/>This can be literally or figurative, btw. A big map game that makes things to closed, to complete, to structural... it won't draw me in. I've had this problem with a lot of people's favorite settings in the past. I had that problem with Exalted's Creation, for example, after... oh.. .probably first edition Lunars. The world started feeling filled in, complete on its own, explored and chronicled. There wasn't any gap that called me to explore it anymore. <br/><br/>Tribe 8, otoh, managed (almost to the end) to keep me wanting to explore. There was so much about the setting that was unsaid, that was gapped, that was uncertain, that contradicted itself in ways that made me want to get in there and play through how it would resolve, that it was a constant call and challenge to get in there and play. Same deal with Exalted when it first came out. How the fuck do all these things work? Why are there barbarian tree rangers rubbing shoulders with dapper city dwellers and hawk knights? I dunno, said my brain, lets find out! <br/><br/>Part of this, clearly, is in my own attitude at the time of play or interaction with the text. But I think that there are things in setting creation for a big map game that can help bring it out of more people. Gaps, calls to adventure, ambiguities in culture and meaning that make you want to get in and fiddle, places where the text (or map) leave off on the details in ways that leave you hanging. <br/><br/>The thing I'm really not sure about is how to do this in a way that makes you want to game rather than, say, write fan fiction. Doing it like Burning Empires where there is a joined game to explore as a game is probably a good way. However, I'm sure there are others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189651/#Comment_189651" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T17:51:49+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  5:51PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Diaspora</i> is all over the implied setting concept -- something we've been throwing around the table for a long while now.

I understand that there is a joy to <i>world-building</i> for some, but world-building isn't the same thing as authorship or role-playing.  Someone can write a great story set in the real world, which is vastly more detailed than any fantasy setting.  Yes, Tolkien was a great author and he did much great world-building, but there are many other great authors who did no worldbuilding at all.  I don't think it is reasonable to classify those who write in real or pre-established settings as doing nothing more than acting out those details.  <br/><br/>If you like and want to world-build, then obviously a detailed setting isn't for you.  I don't think that means that they are unplayable, or that the people who like them are just collectors who do no authorship.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189671/#Comment_189671" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T21:02:39+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  9:02PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Beware the belief that says detail is the antithesis of exploration. Detail is what you discover while exploring. Whether it comes from your own mind or from a setting book, it is the same thing. I love running exploration games, and have always had the most success when using the most excessively detailed settings. The more detail there is, the more "primed" my brain is to come up with more, and better details at that. I don't see the work of the game designer as impinging upon my own creativity, but as a partner in it. If there's something I really don't like in the book, I can write over it just as easily as if I made it up whole cloth, so there's no limit there.<br/><br/>Maps are uninspiring to me because they don't imply anything that I want to turn into a story. Lots of carefully crafted, well-detailed NPCs do inspire me because I can search out the conceptual threads that link them together and extrapolate from those ideas into a larger world. It's just a different approach to worldbuilding, not necessarily better or worse, and certainly no less capable of supporting exploration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189672/#Comment_189672" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-22T21:06:32+00:00" title="January 22, 2009  9:06PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 22, 2009 9:07PM by Brand_Robins.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Madunkieg, <br/><br/>Absolutely. The interesting thing to me is the different ways in which games with different degrees of detail evoke, invoke, provoke and... um.. .out of rhyming words... inspire play, exploration, and creation. <br/><br/>So, what about there being lots of detail really makes it work for you? Like, I hear you about the NPCs -- that's a great point, and I think its worth noting that in several big setting games I've run in the past, when I haven't bothered to read the huge history chapters, I always read the NPCs and pay attention to who they are and what they do. But what about cultural details? Lists of gods or goods? Which details work you up, and which don't? <br/><br/>(Perhaps a spin off thread?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189708/#Comment_189708" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T07:04:13+00:00" title="January 23, 2009  7:04AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bunnybunny</cite>It's why the first edition of<em>Exalted</em>worked for my old group in the setting area.

It's interesting, it's evocative, it's colourful and it's a great place to start when sitting down to write something.  Unfortunately, as the supplement treadmill ground into life and more and more of the setting was fleshed out, that initial coolness was lost.  Simply put, the potential of the ideas in the core book were far superior to the largely generic bullshit contained in supplements.  Mystery is evocative, cookie-cutter governments and dull socio-economics are not.<br/><br/>I think the issue is not so much implied settings as game books that point you in the right direction and then step back ad let you do one of the best things about the hobby : create your own stuff.  Detailed settings books are like pre-published adventures or, Saints Preserve Us, character compendiums - they're a false economy of time, a waste of money and an example of a market-driven hobby convincing people to slit their own creative throats.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/efindel" title="efindel"><img alt="efindel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/efindel">efindel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189712/#Comment_189712" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-23T07:26:35+00:00" title="January 23, 2009  7:26AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's pretty much the way that I always created my D&amp;D worlds.

I understand that there is a joy to<i>world-building</i>for some, but world-building isn't the same thing as authorship or role-playing. Someone can write a great story set in the real world, which is vastly more detailed than any fantasy setting. Yes, Tolkien was a great author and he did much great world-building, but there are many other great authors who did no worldbuilding at all. I don't think it is reasonable to classify those who write in real or pre-established settings as doing nothing more than acting out those details.<br/><br/>If you like and want to world-build, then obviously a detailed setting isn't for you. I don't think that means that they are unplayable, or that the people who like them are just collectors who do no authorship.<br/><br/>I was unduly harsh, I accept that.

Detail is introduced into play through story. For example, I ran a game of Legend of the Five Rings that involved characters investing in businesses. Rather than explain it before the game, I introduced a business that had lost its backer. Other, hostile investors put pressure on the business manager, hiring goons to smash up the place (which were defeated by the characters), then, while the characters were present, the investors showed up to help fund the repairs. Since the characters were of the same social strata as the investors (samurai), one of them figured out that he could do the same, and the character stepped in as a friendly investor. This hooked the characters into the setting's intrigues as well as getting them involved in a detail of the world.<br/><br/>Player enthusiasm depends partially on having the right players. I find it has a lot to do with where people are in their lives, that people who are frustrated in life often don't want to play this sort of game. I try to transmit my enthusiasm by using details to give players more options for solving problems (frustrated players are often looking to games to escape having to think through problems, which is why this approach doesn't work with them). Usually there is not one solution to any given problem, rather I think of one or two methods that will not solve it and allow just about any other approach to succeed. Those players who try different things are rewarded, and success brings enjoyment. Pretty soon, those players are looking for the details (etiquette, cultural knowledge, etc.) that will give them ideas as to how to succeed, much like they might look for that slightly better magic weapon in D&amp;D.<br/><br/>By "one-sheet" I assume you mean create a prep-sheet for players (please correct me if I'm wrong on that). Prep sheets usually cover the sorts of details that players are familiar with knowing for other games, such as money values (6 silver = 1 gold), basic etiquette ("Have you eaten rice today?") and social structure (there is an emperor who rules over the 7 major clans which are headed by daimyo). Their purpose is more for comfort than for providing the details around which the story will revolve.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189841/#Comment_189841" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-24T09:54:38+00:00" title="January 24, 2009  9:54AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>I'm not generally a fan but that 3E main Forgotten Realms book was really purty and fairly damned cool.</blockquote>\nIt was the best Forgotten Realms book ever done, and really the gold standard for fantasy setting books.

I love what you all did with it. Keep up the good work.<br/><br/>As for me, I've yet to find the sweet spot between a detailed setting and an implied one. I find extremely detailed settings to be a total mindblock for fear of forgetting something or screwing something up. This is why I'm simply incapable of running a game in Glorantha (even with YGMV), Harn or Middle Earth. Yet if they're too vague (but appear to have more to them) I'm also blocked because I'm unsure what to fill in where.<br/><br/>Usually, I find brand new settings as the most evocative. Like the very first edition of Midnight. Or the Dark Sun boxed set. Or Star Wars 20 years ago. Or the first edition of Freedom City. Something with enough detail to get going in but not enough to overload.<br/><br/>Conan's Hyborea is like this for me (or rather was before Mongoose started splatting it to death).<br/><br/>If I'm working on a setting though, I usually suffer from my own mindblock. Maybe I should start with a rough, stolen map and just fill in whatever. I think that could work. Once I get going, though, I tend to overreach. Like this setting I was putting together for 4e. Yeah. It's WAY overblown. To the point where I don't think I'd even play in it.<br/><br/>Maybe a GMing book about world-building or something is in order?

What is it about published setting that makes you think you have to use them as written?</blockquote>\nMostly the players, especially with a well-known setting. I mean, if I take Pacific City (from the <i>Nocturnals</i>) and throw in a bunch of Giovanni-style Vampire mobsters no one would be likely to notice. The <i>Nocturnals</i> aren't high on the radar, the setting isn't fully detailed and the addition fits somewhat. There isn't that much to know about it really other than a few tropes, NPCs and locales.<br/><br/>But if I were to take <i>Star Wars</i> and basically toss out the prequels, have Darth Maul be living during the time period of The New Hope and forget/botch that the Hutts actually live on the moon around their homeworld (and not on the homeworld itself). Well, changes (even ones I'd consider minor and/or improvements) are often received poorly by players, in my experience. Invariably, someone whips out the canon stick and pulls us all back into line.<br/><br/>I guess that's why I'd rather play in <i>Midnight's</i> setting than in Tolkein's Middle Earth. And definitely why I'd rather hack up a cheap imitation of Westeros than even remotely consider running a <i>Song of Ice and Fire</i> game.<br/><br/>It's not that I don't like those settings. But it's that I've been the guy that forgot that Sand People were afraid of Jedis. Or forgot that all the Wookies lived in trees on Kashyyk. Or didn't realize that Spider-Man and the Punisher were on good terms now.<br/><br/>I can deal with botching that penicillin wasn't around in the '20s. But some people take these fictional settings to heart and I've seen it impact a game pretty negatively. So I'm more comfortable sticking with settings that are a whole lot of grey area or, at least, aren't really well known.<br/><br/>Something deriviative, with easily recognizable tropes, a few memorable NPCs and a handful of locale names and adventure ideas sounds perfect at the moment. I only have to keep that in mind next time I prep a game.<br/><br/>I'm off to scrap that potential 4e setting for the umpteenth time...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_189944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189944/#Comment_189944" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-25T23:47:43+00:00" title="January 25, 2009 11:47PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: madunkieg</cite>I'm a little puzzled.

If the point of play is to get the experience of the world "right" according to the players at the table, and the players at the table come to that table with preconceived notions, then the point of play is to make the experience of the world fit those preconceived notions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189982/#Comment_189982" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T08:34:20+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  8:34AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2009 8:34AM by JDCorley.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And in the same way, there are players and games for which a mistake about penicillin in the 1920s would be nine thousand more times a game killer than remembering Wookiees lived in trees.<br/><br/>The important thing is that this is not just negative. It's not just that if you fuck it up, people don't have fun, it's that there is deep and abiding satisfaction in getting a highly detailed setting - even one you just made up yourself - <i>right.</i> <br/><br/>I experienced this satisfaction just yesterday in my nWoD game. There were many factions contending for this particular goal (or keeping others from it, or achieving it before someone else does something else, and so on).  The player characters performed a series of actions keeping information from one side, tricking another, and steering a third, and I kept it all straight and was able to work out the consequences of success, failure and near-success for each of the PC actions. Like clockwork, the situation ground finer and the walls closed in tighter. It was such a wonderful feeling. It was a highly detailed situation concocted out of a highly detailed setting - modern life on the border, plus a nWoD supernatural force.  Without the detail, I would miss the satisfaction of getting it right because there would be no way to get it wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190097/#Comment_190097" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T15:26:45+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  3:26PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A great (fictional) example of successfully using a published, highly-detailed setting is the Knights of the Dinner Table. The players all know every angle of the "official" setting, from races to cultures to caravan routes to each little town.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying in any fictional world with that level of universal setting-knowledge would be awesome. You could say "The fletching on the arrows is made of eagle feathers dyed black" and one player would know that meant the raiders were deadly goblins from the Red Marches and the rest of the group would all understand what that meant for their characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn reality, it would be super difficult to get a group on the same page like that, and the *attempt* to play that way would drive everyone insane. But if you had that rare group playing in the Forgotten Realms or Middle Earth or whatever, it would be great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190100/#Comment_190100" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-26T15:34:46+00:00" title="January 26, 2009  3:34PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, Wookiees lived in trees?
