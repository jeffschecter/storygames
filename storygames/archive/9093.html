Three times a year, there is a Gameday sponsored by the people who frequent the ENWorld and Circus Maximus forums at NC State. Eclectic games are run, people come from all over, it's (almost) always a ton of fun.<br/><br/>A while back, I ran a game with The Shadow of Yesterday which I <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">was inspired by</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">cribbed off of</span> stole from Jason Morningstar to see if a dungeon crawl could make it as a TSOY scenario. I've run it multiple times and it can be fun, but itches - like a cool sweater you got that's made of something you're allergic to.<br/><br/>He signed up for my game. I'd been told by others that he was a game wrecker. I felt it best to give him a chance. I treated him like all my other players, and he nearly ruined the game with his ... cheating.<br/><br/>So, let me back track again. I had these cool coins from a game called Runebound and I set them in the middle. I explained that the copper coins were 1 XP, the silver coins were 5 XP, and the gold coins were 10 XP. Please evaluate what level of XP you've earned when you earn it and take the XP out of the center of the table. I'm not going to slow down the game by evaluating your contributions and handing out XP. Please be a good person about it.<br/><br/>He took 5 XP every single time for each Key, except that he always hit two Keys, so 10 XP kept being taken. I wasn't watching, because I make continuous eye contact during a game, trying to maintain good engagement in the events. Now, I know that the game is self correcting and he should have been written out of the story rather quickly. But that's not what the others saw. They kept on looking at his sheet where he ended up getting two Grand Master Abilities and didn't act because they knew that he'd just do what he wanted and the dice would back him up.<br/><br/>There are more than one problem here. I wasn't watching closely and could have intervened. I should have pushed for him to use those Abilities and be written out of the story.<br/><br/>But, I come away with this: he willingly acted in an uncool way. Everyone complained that his actions were a downer for them and for the game itself. I don't want to be at the same table with him again.<br/><br/>Next Gameday is late this month in April. He's signed up for my game again. I have built up such ill will since I last saw him that I don't know if I could run a good game even if he'd completely rehabilitated himself. I fucking hate it, but I'm asking the organizer to either contact him or let me contact him to have himself unregister for my game. I fucking hate it, but I've backed out of a game I want to play because he's signed up for it, too.<br/><br/>RAWR!! I shout at the heavens with frustration!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201065/#Comment_201065" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-07T06:51:56+00:00" title="April  7, 2009  6:51AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 7, 2009 6:52AM by Graham.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's strong, but perfectly acceptable, to insist someone not play your game.

Two, I was running under the idea of "big finale with the strengths of all the characters coming to bear".
