Game X and Game Y are fun and all, but I don't want to play them all the time. If I want to play Game Foo, I'm out of luck. Bringing a new game to the table takes some effort, starting with a) reading up about new games, then b) sinking some dosh into the game, then c) reading it, and then d) communicating it to the table. That's a lot of work right there. I personally do not find it a lot of work. Other people do. I want to play Game [a-zA-Z], so the GMing/facilitating role falls on me. Which is fair enough, I'm not moaning. But the push to GM comes out of that, and not something perhaps more positive.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nPete                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249085/#Comment_249085" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-30T04:44:45+00:00" title="December 30, 2009  4:44AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like to be the boss and stage manage, play bunches of characters, and see how my friends react to stuff I throw at them.

But as the GM, it's my JOB to create problems for everybody and generally make stuff happen.  Plus I like to try new games as above.

Wanting to bring a new game to the table, feeling like I "have to" GM because no one else will and it's game night...no, uh-uh, not going to do that ever again.  I've gone down that road in the past, and it leads to not having fun and eventually burning out, so fuck that.  I'd rather GM less if it means that I'll really enjoy GMing when I do it.<br/><br/>What makes me want to GM is pretty much wanting to do the things you get to do as a GM.  You get to play the world: switching between NPCs, creating opposition, reacting to what the players do, describing the scene, trying to control the pacing, setting a plot in motion and seeing where it goes, giving everyone a chance to get involved and have fun, and so on.  It's not really that much more work than playing, but it is <i>more intense</i> work a lot of the time, since you're almost always in the spotlight and therefore really have to keep your energy up.  Doing it well is a major ego boost and makes you feel awesome for days afterwards.<br/><br/>I also want to GM because I like prep work.  I like sitting around in the week before the session thinking about what we'll be doing on Saturday.  I like preparing things and I get a great feeling of satisfaction when that preparation pays off in the actual game, and that goes double when it pays off in an unexpected way because of something the players did.  Also, the prep work I do as a GM is different from the prep I do as a player: more intense, more comprehensive, more organized.  GM prepwork is its own kind of fun.<br/><br/>And really, it's wanting that different "GM fun" that moves me to run a game.  It's very, very rare that I run across a system or a novel or a movie that makes me think "Oh damn, I totally have to run a game of that": instead, I come at it from the opposite direction.  I think "Oh damn, I totally want to run a game," and then I go looking for something that would be fun to GM.  When I do find something that clicks with me, I'll pitch it to our group and we'll play it.<br/><br/><br/>(As it turns out, GM-less games don't actually scratch the same itch for me...probably because I don't like mixing my "GM fun" with "player fun."  I want to concentrate on one or the other and fully enjoy it, not split my focus between them.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249170/#Comment_249170" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-30T11:23:41+00:00" title="December 30, 2009 11:23AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having one great image in my head that I want to let out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249171/#Comment_249171" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-30T11:23:45+00:00" title="December 30, 2009 11:23AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like being able to take the cool stuff I come up with, have other people interact with it, and then watch it change and think of ways it reacts to player actions.<br/><br/>I like having something to do relating to my next game when it's not happening.<br/><br/>I also like having the most screen-time in game (by screen-time I really mean "most time spent doing things as any character" rather than a specific one).

You get to play the world: switching between NPCs, creating opposition, reacting to what the players do, describing the scene, trying to control the pacing, setting a plot in motion and seeing where it goes, giving everyone a chance to get involved and have fun, and so on.  It's not really that much more work than playing, but it is<i>more intense</i>work a lot of the time, since you're almost always in the spotlight and therefore really have to keep your energy up.  Doing it well is a major ego boost and makes you feel awesome for days afterwards.<br/><br/>I also want to GM because I like prep work.  I like sitting around in the week before the session thinking about what we'll be doing on Saturday.  I like preparing things and I get a great feeling of satisfaction when that preparation pays off in the actual game, and that goes double when it pays off in an unexpected way because of something the players did.  Also, the prep work I do as a GM is different from the prep I do as a player: more intense, more comprehensive, more organized.  GM prepwork is its own kind of fun.</blockquote>\nThis really hits close to home with me. Street marketplaces are my favourite character class, closely followed by secret clubs and farms. I love trying to invent or research new variations on really mundane things, to make the setting something to really explore.<br/><br/>Designing challenges is a lot like being a teacher, a profession I hope to enter in a few years. Your goal as a GM is to help people grow in some way, to gain some new understanding, practice problem-solving reasoning, or whatever. Roleplaying games present unusual opportunities and difficulties in presenting challenges. Also, part of the prep work is learning something (ie growing myself) in some way that might also challenge the players. This may not seem to fit with the player-driven approach that is popular at Story Games, but believe me, there's a lot more options to bring in player input than the two stylistic extremes (shared-GMing and railroading) might suggest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249302/#Comment_249302" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-01T02:16:57+00:00" title="January  1, 2010  2:16AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will have fun being the GM if I don't have to play "God" and control the whole world that isn't the players.
