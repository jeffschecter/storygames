Over the course of an hour or two, you and your friends will construct a narrative about a Community of heroic (or delusional) isolationists, who construct for themselves an entrenched bastion against (what they perceive to be) the hostile forces of the outer world. As they bolster up the defenses of their outpost, they will encounter unexpected misfortunes and betrayals, and fight bravely (or foolishly) against threats from the Outsiders whose world they have abandoned, until a final day of reckoning arrives.<br/><br/>(I solicited feedback on an early draft of this here a couple of years ago; curious to know what folks might think of the finished version.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RickDean" title="RickDean"><img alt="RickDean" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/466/nYRCWQBW2OXHC.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RickDean">RickDean</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468002/#Comment_468002" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-26T08:01:40+00:00" title="November 26, 2017  8:01AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the premise!

There's a brief character generation phase at the outset for the story's main protagonists, but players can switch perspectives at will - they don't need to stick with a single character for the whole game. <br/><br/>Once that's done, each turn consists of rolling on a table of minimally described plot elements, locating that event on a slowly evolving map of the Enclave, and then briefly describing what happens there. After 25 turns of this (which usually clocks in at around 2-3 hours of gameplay, depending on how chatty the players are) one player gets to develop a slightly longer "denouement."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468019/#Comment_468019" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-26T21:16:58+00:00" title="November 26, 2017  9:16PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How long has the game been in your playtest?

Is it always a clear consensus or have their been some close votes?  How do players react to being voted "not the best storyteller at the the table"?  It feels like this could illicit some hurt feelings at a crucial moment of the game experience, but maybe I'm missing something about how it actually functions not having read through the entire game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_468418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lord_goon" title="lord_goon"><img alt="lord_goon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lord_goon">lord_goon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468418/#Comment_468418" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-12-12T04:33:00+00:00" title="December 12, 2017  4:33AM">December 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It depends on the group, of course, but there was never any awkwardness among the people I playtested it with. I suppose such a thing could occur at a convention or some other venue where players weren't previously acquainted. But in all of my tests, players were quite careful to preserve a few fortune tokens so they could vote on changing the outcome, and the denouement was always a lively, fairly fun process of negotiation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_468742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/frenzykitty" title="frenzykitty"><img alt="frenzykitty" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/557/n6V5J0A17A1B2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/frenzykitty">frenzykitty</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/468742/#Comment_468742" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-08T06:50:41+00:00" title="January  8, 2018  6:50AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is very tempting.
