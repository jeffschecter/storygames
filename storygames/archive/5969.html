While hazy, things are not completely forgotten (unlike other rpging experiences) just because it was the only time I experienced real fear while playing, a fear directly inspired by the fictional events transpiring from the game.<br/><br/>Out of game situation: a rpging marathon, due to a holiday in the middle of the summer. We gathered at the home of the GM with the precise intent to play 'til we dropped, or something like that. He lived there with his parents \u2013 but then, we all lived with our respective parents then: we were a bunch of guys in our early twenties, most of us still students at the university. The chosen system was GURPS, a ssystem none of us was well versed with, but we trusted the GM \u2013 and anyway, we hardly rolled dice that night. The GM had an adventure prepped, or so he claimed, and he would sometimes cue in appropriate music from horror movie soundtracks (mostly Italian band Goblin, a staple of the early Dario Argento's works). We played sitting around the customary dinner table. We started with 4-5 people plus the GM, but as the game progressed, and the time passed, our group thinned, the others leaving the game in the wee hours. In the end, it was only the GM and two players. Similarly, the house was full of life during the day, with the rest of the family of the GM going around, but at night it was dark and still, mostly due to our desire not to disturb the other family members. Now and then the cat was doing eerie noises, out of our sight.<br/><br/>In game situation: modern horror. The group was investigating about some murdering around an abbey. I can't remember the details, but there were monks, prophecies, dark aisles, tombs. I was a cynical detective, the only guy remaining 'til the end an enthusiast journalist, if memory serves. At the frightening moment, we were penetrating a tunnel (maybe a tomb with a tunnel?) \u2013 no, wait, <i>I</i> was in the tunnel, the other guy remained outside, at voice's reach. The GM described that suddenly, in the dark, I was seeing a pair of red eyes. I looked at the other guy, and we freaked out. Totally. We were like "Run! Omigod runrunrun! Aieeee!". I felt a physical urge to stand up from my chair and run. I barely resisted. No kidding. The other guy told me he experienced the same.<br/><br/>Why it was scary: I'm not sure about it. As you can see, the situation itself was kind of bland. There wasn't a real build up, a climax to that point. In fact, we players were totally lost \u2013 and months after that night, the GM admitted he prepped only half of the adventure, and at that point he was completely improvising. The GM was speaking just with his normal voice, the cat was sleeping, there were no music, no gimmicks, no other things going on. The fact was, I think, that we were, at that moment, completely focused on the game, and completely attuned each other. We had no distractions, and we had time to get accustomed to this: it was hours since the less-motivated guys left, and hours since the other family members went sleeping. We was just <i>in</i> the game, not in the GM house playing the game, and I think it was because of the insane amount of time we was in \u2013 at that point, we were have been there for 12 hours straight, and we had our last break for pizza 6 hours before. Maybe we were so tired that we could not to focuse to anything else. I mean, in real life, if was seeing a pair of red eyes staring at me from the back of a dark tunnel, I'd sure run like hell. At that moment, the game was the real life. It was only a moment, a handful of seconds, but it was real.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133560/#Comment_133560" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-09T07:23:36+00:00" title="March  9, 2008  7:23AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's awesome, Paolo.

It has been the bane of all my roleplaying days, really.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134375/#Comment_134375" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T11:25:10+00:00" title="March 12, 2008 11:25AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My friend D was running a Vampire game Ars Magica troupe style. Elders, neonates, and mortals.  In a session with the mortals, I think we were in some ruins, investigating some ancient horror buried there, or something similar.  All I really remember is that there was a long dark hall with a body laying in it. The lights were already low. Once it was decided that some of us were going to investigate the body, he got up and laid down at the end of the hall, which wasn't long but it was dark.  And we basically LARPed approaching the body and checking it out. I've surpressed what actually happened. I think he grabbed whoever was closest.  Despite knowing *he* was alive, everyone freaked the fuck out.<br><br>I think the key to a scary scene is setting the right mood (low lights, and similar) and acting it out. Saying the zombie is about to grab you isn't as effective as the GM acting the part of the zombie trying to grab you.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134411/#Comment_134411" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T12:50:52+00:00" title="March 12, 2008 12:50PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dudes, these comments are all absolutely fantastic and really useful. The turnout makes me teary-eyed!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Willow</cite>I'm interested in what has been posted so far... but sadly, I don't have too many genuine terror moments of my own to share.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Yeah, unfortunately I too haven't done too much "pure terror". Creepy horror, sure, but that's just the basic speaking and mood-making junk. Nothing really truly scary/terrifying, though.</blockquote>\nWillow, Andy and others who feel the same - please consider posting an experience that <b>didn't</b> work for you, even when you wanted or intended for it to be scary. Also, "creepy" is perfectly valid if that is the extent of your horror experiences. Sometimes, a game might want to elicit a ponderous, building creepiness, maybe never to escalate into "pure terror" at all. As such, I'm equally interested in what situations you have found to be creepy, as I am to what makes you want to jump out of your skin.<br><br>I'd like to address some of these responses further because they're really interesting. I don't want this to become the mondo-thread of doom, though. If anyone has problems with me spawning a few more threads from this one, maybe up to half a dozen at a time, please whisper me and I'll avoid doing so.<br><br>Thanks guys, really. Keep 'em coming!                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elmago79" title="elmago79"><img alt="elmago79" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f41/doguiii/rdh12.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elmago79">elmago79</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134953/#Comment_134953" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T14:44:22+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  2:44PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>1. Experienced an actual horrific moment while role-playing. What was the situation, in and out of game? Why was it scary? Who made it scary and how? How would you best describe the experience, in one or two words - shock? suspense? terrible insight? survival instinct? discomfort?</blockquote>\nI've had an incredibly horrific moment while GMing a Call of Cthulhu game, sort of... We forgot the CoC charsheets so we used WoD sheets instead. <br><br>Out of game: This creepy apartment one of my players used to live in. Five of us sitting around the dinner table. There were two things that contributed heavily to the environment: a) a faulty lamp, that flickered continuously during the whole  game and b) a coffee machine that we forgot to turn off... every time I said to the players that they heard the sound of drums in the distance the machine would act the part.<br/><br/>In game: Everyone plays their part very well. As the game progresses, we start feeling uncomfortable and afraid about what's happening in game. After the host of the dinner party the PCs are attending is murdered, the PCs relive parts of the evening in grotesque variants. The GM (that's me) is also freaked out. A strange simian creature starts to appear in this visions the PC's are having, the "white monkey". Late in the game, on of the NPCs suddenly turns around and kills another NPC with an elephant rifle. One of the PCs asked "Why did you do that?" "Because I'm the white monkey", he said. Everybody screamed. Even writing it and remembering gives me the chills. I guess the best category for what happened was "terrible insight".<br/><br/>Why was it scary? I don't know. I couldn't replicate it latter with any degree of certainty. Everyone was willing to be scared and contributed to the ambiance by being scared in character. The apartment was also a great playing aid. But the moment? I'm not sure. It was great, anyway.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
