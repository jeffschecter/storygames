Most of us were new or unsure on the rules, so we were coming up a learning curve, but I had a fantastic time playing my monsters \u201cto win\u201d.<br/><br/>While there wasn\u2019t a ton of content, there was a really fun vibe at the table, with the jokes and side-comments and that first little feeling of how the game helps engender camaraderie among the players.  I thought I was going to have a chance to coup-de-grace a player, but the group played it safe and I lost my chance.    I think next session will go much faster.  <br/><br/>I was really happy that my prep was effective \u2013 I prepared about a dozen encounters, and while we only played 2, my encounter packages meant that I didn\u2019t have a lot of lag time where I was just setting up the encounter.  I did draw the map at the table, but I\u2019m keeping those maps to use for later slogs.<br/><br/>In general, the game felt the Dungeons and Dragons I was playing when 3rd Edition came out.  <br/><br/>What I really loved though was that because I said "you set up the session, I'll run the game" I didn't do any of the social organizing / cajoling / hoping people would show up.

Now I run a campaign where a good 50% or so of encounters are out doors, so the general features are frequently not tied to a specific adventure/etc. as much as a building is (e.g., tonight the PC's are likely to hit 2-4 of following:   outdoors with a pit where two features on map are adventure specific, outoors with a generic camp, small generic shrine out doors (change altar is all), river bend outdoors, and one structure that is specialized).  So my "fallen tree leaning against another you can run up to get height advantage and shoot any foe even if another standing in front of them" and my "fast flowing river that carries creatures 3 squares unless they make appropriate check" etc. can be still be used in the "fey heavy adventure" even if they didn't figure in the "cult adventure", just scaling some checks.  And the specialized structure is a "90% hard point", it will take a cunning cunning plan to not have to take it on (though if they are cunning enough, sure).<br/><br/>The "role architecture" of 4e encounters just means replacing/scaling up the critters if need be (the evil cultist artillery 3 is replaced by fey creature artillery 4).  I find DDI very handy for doing this (okay show me all fey artillery 4 please, hmm none good, show me all artillery 3 and maybe I slap fey template on one etc.).<br/><br/>This is also handy since I'm running  a game where some players are remote in maptool and it means my maptool maps are not wasted (table+maptool working better then I thought as scans of most WOTC adventure maps are available as are ones of adventure tiles, or you can make your own, a regular table player connects on his mini-lap top and helps move tokens etc.).<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryant" title="Bryant"><img alt="Bryant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryant">Bryant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229820/#Comment_229820" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-03T09:30:25+00:00" title="September  3, 2009  9:30AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like a blast.<br/><br/>I wouldn't get too focused on having the monsters playing to win; they can become a little bland if you do that.

Things that may contribute to that:<br/><br/>- I usually script in my notes or head (I have a prerolled monster initiative order with basic tactics I do for each encounter) that "big bad cuts and runs if 3/4 of his team is down or he's at below 1/4 hp and not on verge of winning", "big bad's team cuts and runs if he drops and at least 1/2 of them are down" (I have made clear to PC's in our house rules/notes that you get XP for foes who retreat if they're bloodied, not if they're unbloodied and just being sensible).<br/><br/>- antigrind (as in Players care) factors that have come into longer encounters - man that one minion's life is charmed, how long can he last - we should vote really he was the boss monster and elevate him, after all we can't be having this much trouble finishing a minion, missed again, LOL; they're fleeing don't let them, they'll warn the cult (the PC's really don't like letting intellligent foes get away, they know my DM style too well, the ranger prides himself on the time he shot the horse out from under the fleeing mage - they're infantry, no love of horses)., I have monsters talk and trash talk and it not be irrelevant; <br/><br/>- I'm very careful of using brutes, tend to keep an eye on the soldier quotient unless they're lower level than party<br/><br/>- Solo Fights have only been with foes personally connected to PC's where story quotient is high (only 2 so far:  it's your possessed friend, can you bring him down without killing (we use modified rule on free to not kill); it's your father's ghost can you get through to him before he rips party apart).  In both cases there were skill options to short circuit fight (party didn't use them in first fight and friend died with ramifications still reverberating 2 adventures later, worked in 2nd solo - son got through to father's ghost after about 5-6 rounds and the ghost gave its dire warnings to his son and vanished, all the damage it had done vanishing as well).<br/><br/>Closing in on level 5, not dragging so far.  Just had 'total party dead and dying and captured' in the first combat that actually took all game night and table agreed 2 weeks ago that levels are wizzing by faster than character story issues are resolving and we would cut XP by 50% (sort of what DMG recommends for a capped level campaign).<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229860/#Comment_229860" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-03T11:37:39+00:00" title="September  3, 2009 11:37AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Ryan, I understand the rationale behind the E6 capping and was following those threads interestedly awhile back.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm curious, did you do a similar analysis for 4E and discover that high level 4E play has the same issues that high level d20 play had?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229875/#Comment_229875" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-03T12:29:18+00:00" title="September  3, 2009 12:29PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph: Somewhat, but ... 4e is more playable at high levels, but from reports it still becomes less and less reliable.

Use your judgement as to what kind of compromise might be involved.  For example: "Okay, you kill 'em, but your defender loses another healing surge," or "Okay, this guy in the back just runs away."  Of course, if the last monster has only one hit left before he goes down, just end it for free.  Etc, etc.<br/><br/>Pretty much any player will be okay with this.  They'll find the grind just as boring as you do, so ending it is best for everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230010/#Comment_230010" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T06:59:32+00:00" title="September  4, 2009  6:59AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, players, don't forget that Intimidate lets you scare off opponents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
