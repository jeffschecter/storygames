                    Ok, here's some stuff I'm working on. <b>Bold stuff=ideas especially welcome</b>, but feedback regardless is cool. Most of this is just filling out the <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/EvaSchiffer.pdf" rel="nofollow">character sheet.</a><br/><br/>What you do:<br/>All PCs are young women of quality, between the ages of 17 and 35<br/><br/>Choose a name from the list, or select one yourself.<br/><br/>Nationality<br/>You may be American, British, French, German, Swiss, or Italian.<br/>American girls get some benefit when attempting rash, bold, or dangerous things<br/>British girls get some benefit in withstanding hardship or enduring duress<br/>French girls get some benefit in dissembling and social exchanges<br/>German girls get some benefit in physical exertion and weathering illness<br/>Swiss girls get some benefit in making and using mechanical equipment<br/>Italian girls get some benefit in languages and history<br/><br/>Marital Status<br/>You may be single, engaged, or married<br/>Single girls must travel in company. This restricts their movement, but they may assist each other in their work.<br/>Engaged girls may call on their fiance and his resources to rescue them, but they may also be called back to marriage before their work is complete.<br/>Married girls have the help of their husband, and any wealth he may have, but they are understood to publish under his name.<br/><br/><b>Scientific Specialty - ????? </b>I think it should relate to one of the Courses<br/><br/>Obsession - write down a thing that you, the player, know much about and find fascinating. For me, it would be mummies.<br/><br/>Graces<br/>Roll 4 d8 and assign them to the four Graces - Wealth, Social Standing, Sanity, and Brilliance.<br/>Wealth - this is how you are able to fund your work, your basic resources in dress, housing, etc., and your family connections and holdings<br/>Social Standing - this is your access to culture, your regard in the eyes of others, and your obligations as part of the social scene<br/>Sanity - this is your reason, your level-headedness, your cool wit<br/>Brilliance - this is your scientific spark, the drive to discover, the insight for experimentation<br/>These will be starting resources, and change over play.<br/><br/>The courses of study<br/><b>How to put marks here</b><br/><br/><br/>Accomplishments<br/>Roll 4 d4 and assign one to each. Mark off eight plus the die roll on the spaces given.<br/>Speak/Read Languages - useful for doing what it says, and extrapolating to unfamiliar tongues<br/>Recall History- useful to recall useful bits of information<br/>Practice Social Grace - useful to avoid insults, grasp local customs, and<br/>Dissemble - useful to talk oneself out of situations or gain access to things of interest<br/><br/>Now, notice the color shifts across the courses of study - those break into marking periods. When your marks in any course cross a marking period, you may add to your Land &amp; Estates, your Mechanical Marvels, or your Personal Loyalties.<br/><br/>Any time after you have added your second marking period, you may write"How you will show them all". Keep this secret.                </div>

                            And Mileva Maric, Jocelyn Bell and many other more modern female luminaries. All that aside, I'm liking the mixture of conforming to stereotypes (national traits, how a character's relationship to a man defines them in play) and breaking them (with scientific experimentation).

Yeah, the thing is, how to tie them in with the Courses of Study, and should they also tie into the Obsession. Mummies ties into Archeology, not really any of the others. I'd use anthro in a stretch. At this very moment, I'm leaning away from them being tied too closely. And 'Rocket Chair' is a Mechanical Marvel, for sure.

That's definitly part of the game. You're a Young Lady of Quality, a paragon of virtue and spirit, possessing all that is perfect and peerless in womanhood, aloof, beautiful and serenely self-confident,  yet you are setting off for Darkest Africa to record the rituals of a tribe of canibals. Or searching through the wilds of Tibet for the secret to better gunpowder. Or trekking through the Amazonian jungle to make the first ever moving picture of a rare butterfly. Or testing your ideas about aeroplanes. Then, you have to deal with your rights to publish and persue your work in spite of your sex.                        </div>

                            Again, <b>bold=hmmm.</b> Joshua, does this make it clear where I'm going?<br><br>What you do next:<br>Decide which of you will be the first Guide. The Guide will play all NPCs and be responsible for describing any difficulties or other details of the expedition. The Guideâ€™s character is assumed to be at the School during this expedition, and will have a scene describing her experiences at home. Each of the players will be the Guide at least once, and players may suggest events, details, or dangers to the Guide. <br><br>Roll 1d6 on the world map. Where the die lands, the next expedition will take place. The number on the die is the number of dangers, challenges, etc, that must be met and over-come in order for the expedition to be successful. In a party of two or more, each lady in turn may face the dangers of the expedition, sharing the perils.<br><br/>When facing a difficulty, use your Accomplishments as applicable. <br/>Roll 2d8, and roll under your Accomplishment to successfully overcome the challenge.<br/>If you roll under your Accomplishment, you may proceed to the next challenge. If you succeed in all challenges, the expedition is a success â€“ add marks to the relevant Course(s) of Study equal to twice the number of pips on the d6. If this puts a Course into a new Marking Period, add to your Lands and Estates, your Mechanical Marvels, or your Personal Loyalties. You must use all your Accomplishments before repeating.<br/><br/>If you roll over your Accomplishment, you suffer the danger and the expedition is lost. Erase marks from your Graces equal to the pips remaining on the d6. You may use your Lands and Estates, Mechanical Marvels, and Personal Loyalties to bring your Accomplishments up and avoid going over. You may not use any of them twice in one expedition, however.<br/><br/><b>When you complete a Course of Study, </b><br/><br/><b>When you have exhausted a Grace, </b><br/><br/>Program of Scenes<br/>Matriculation<br/>Present your character in public. Share what compelled you to enroll in Miss Schifferâ€™s School for Young Ladies of Quality. Any single ladies will be paired as traveling companions. If one of a pair is acting as the Guide, the remaining lady must join another pair.<br/>Preparation<br/>Before each expedition, make certain you know which ladies are going, and what they wish to achieve. Obviously, this scene happens after the die is rolled on the map. You may also wish to reveal any relationships with people that might be important, and how they take the news of this latest jaunt. <br/>Arrival<br/>When you arrive at the place of your expedition, the Guide will describe the manner of your reception and any events of interest. <br/>Danger<br/>These must flow naturally from the location and nature of the expedition. A blizzard in the Alps is fine; a blizzard in the Saharra, under nearly all circumstances, is not. We are ladies of science, please.<br/>Interlude<br/>After you have successfully faced peril, you may advance your purpose by describing any research or other action you undertake.<br/>Danger<br/>Subsequent dangers are handled in the same manner as the first.<br/>Departure<br/>The Guide will again describe the conditions of your leave-taking and your return to the School. The Guide may bring danger into the arrival and departure.<br/>R&amp;R<br/>After each expedition, you must take time to rest, relax, recuperate, and refresh yourself. Each lady will have a scene in which she is involved with one of the following, each with itâ€™s own benefits.<br/>-Research: risk Sanity to gain Brilliance<br/>-Romance: risk Social Standing to gain Wealth<br/>-Relationships: risk Brilliance to gain Social Standing<br/>-Recreation: risk Wealth to gain Sanity<br/><br/>You may risk marks from your Graces in any amount. If you are successful, you add that number of marks to the indicated Grace. If you fail, erase that number of marks from the risked Grace.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            This is not a wholly thought-out idea, but I'm used to throwing things out unformed for others to do with what they will. A friend of mine once referred to it as "distributed thinking." So, with disclaimer taken care of:<br/>
<br/>
Select one course as your "major" subject. You will fill out all four "blocks" for that course. Select another as your "minor" subject. You will fill out three blocks in it. Two other courses of considered study will get two blocks each filled out. And two courses of scattered knowledge with get one block apiece.<br/>
<br/>
In the graces, select one to get 4 blocks filled, then 3, then 2, then only 1.<br/>
In the accomplishments, 3-2-1-0<br/>
<br/>
Now, each section is filled out by entering four different numbers from 0-9. (e.g.: 1478 or 2359)<br/>
<br/>
When the course of events start to turn against our heroine, the player must roll some number of d10 to alter the path of her destiny. One die for a typical effort, more for more dire circumstance.<br/>
<br/>
For each d10 rolled, the player must strike out a block that contains that number, and then narrate how she used the characteristic(s) in order to affect the outcome.<br/>
<br/>
Example: Adelaide's fiancee has sent his valet around to bring her to a social event, but she isn't ready to leave the library quite yet. Rolling one d10, she gets a 6. She could cross off the "3679" block under Paleontology in order to distract the valet with a picture book about trilobites, or the "1368" block in Dissemble to trick him into going on ahead. Her two blocks in Wealth are "1257" and "2890", so simply bribing the man is not an option.                        </div>

                            Some questions, if you have time to answer them:<br/>
<br/>
Why would a Lady decide to go haring off over the horizon to engage in dangerous research? Why would she stop, once she had started?<br/>
<br/>
I get the feeling that these questions may be an important part of character creation, and that they may be linked to "How you will show them all" - but how does this form part of the play procedures (assuming it's there at all?)                        </div>

Yes! Perhaps there are also Theory classes, and perhaps this is some of what the Guide's lady does meanwhile, but what better way to learn than hands-on study?

Why would a Lady decide to go haring off over the horizon to engage in dangerous research?<br>  Excitment, adventure, the drive to Know, the desire to prove her theory, avoiding the inevitable society marriage, on a dare, to show her mother she was worth all that trouble.  <br>Why would she stop, once she had started? <br>  She ran out of money; her curiosity was satisfied and she went on to publish, teach and lecture about her work; she got married; she suffered a blow so grievious that her heart was no longer in the work; her brilliant mind burned out.                        </br></br></br></div>

                            Meg: absolutely. But are these reasons explored in the game, or is it all about the field trips?<br/>
<br/>
Put another way: school is often seen as a rite of passage: you're going from somewhere to somewhere else. Are the start point and end point of this journey particularly important in your game, or is it all about what happens at the school?                        </div>
