I want the sheets to convey a self-contained set of rules for each character, to communicate how to play the game as much as possible. I think there will need to be an additional sheet with procedure for setup and other order of play things. <br/><br/>The dice-as-resources concept is very untested, and I need to run some games to see how the dice pools should be adjusted, or if explicit scene framing will even work here.<br/><br/>I have pretty specific ideas about the tone of this game, but serious questions about how relatable that tone is / whether it fits with the kind of "cat stories" other people are interested in.<br/><br/>So, here's the first seven (out of ten, I think) character sheets:<br/><br/><a href="http://tenthousandmogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Cats-charactersv0.1.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tenthousandmogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Cats-charactersv0.1.pdf</a><br/><br/>And here's another post with other ideas about this game:<br/><br/><a href="http://tenthousandmogs.com/?p=64" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tenthousandmogs.com/?p=64</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d" title="Archangel3d"><img alt="Archangel3d" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nHJSFRW82OXJ8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Archangel3d">Archangel3d</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440867/#Comment_440867" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-12T18:47:25+00:00" title="December 12, 2014  6:47PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haven't had a chance to read through it in fine detail yet, but first impression from my quick skim: absolutely love your "Draw Yourself" as part of the character sheet, with the unique feature of your 'kind'. I immediately wanted to start drawing a Magus, just to craft my magnificent FuManchu whiskers. Bit disappointed the Shadow and Acro-Cat don't have a distinct feature compared to the others, but I can understand why.<br/><br/>bookmarking this to check out later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440868">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Patrick_L" title="Patrick_L"><img alt="Patrick_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/999/nLXZTS67FSGIK.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Patrick_L">Patrick_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440868/#Comment_440868" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-12T19:05:38+00:00" title="December 12, 2014  7:05PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did a read through and it looks pretty interesting.

This would be a really fun game to play (probably one-shot).<br/>Are the rules a AW-hack of some kind or is this the self-contained rule set?<br/><br/>Also, the <i>intention</i> of the game is not quite clear. Either, you'd have a story that would put the PCs into situation with a clear team objective (defend territory, rescue friend, find lost lover, get rid of menacing dogs...) or each cat has its own agenda and they interact in interesting ways.<br/><br/>Lovely game, definitely in the range of what I and some friends would play.

I hope that the character "Introduce Yourself" sections fuel interesting interactions, but the basic situation will need a strong in-play primer.<br/><br/>Hence, the first draft of the "Prologue" rules: <a href="http://tenthousandmogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Cats-prologuev1.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tenthousandmogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Cats-prologuev1.pdf</a><br/><br/>Hoping to give enough of a prompt to set tone, establish a few basic premises, and spur imagination without pre-defining too much. Does it do this? Is there anything you're left wondering about that would obstruct play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440954/#Comment_440954" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-17T16:09:40+00:00" title="December 17, 2014  4:09PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2014 4:10PM by AsIf.">edited December 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking about a game like this for a long time - although my take on it was more realistic (and therefore kinda ironic, like "You see a huge monster coming - you do an action to escape it - but actually it's just a car.")  But I like where you're going with this - a much more fecund fantasy setting.<br/><br/>The "Warrior Cats" series definitely comes to mind, I assume you've read those.  A couple other influences you might want to think about if you haven't already...<br/><br/>"Jenny and the Cat Club" - classic YA books by Esther Averill<br/><br/>The secret life of cats in some of the H.P.Lovecraft "Dream Cycle" stories (in Lovecraft's world, cats not only have a society but they can actually leap to the moon from rooftops, and they have a whole civilization up there)<br/><br/>And a lot more here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_cats_in_literature" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_cats_in_literature</a><br/><br/>Keep going!  I would definitely play this game. :-)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
