You have a new game you're going to run tonight and you hope it will go smoothly.  If it does, you'll know all the planning and preparation has been worth it.  There's just one problem: Bob is playing.<br/><br/>Maybe his name's not Bob and maybe he doesn't always look the same, but every GM has had to deal with Bob at least once.  You'd really rather not this time.<br/><br/>Bob has a pattern, you see.  Bob likes to cause trouble.  Bob likes to do whatever the least-appropriate thing to do might be.  If the group needs to stay together, Bob will go off on his own.  If the situation calls for diplomacy, Bob will take a dump in the punchbowl.  Bob sows chaos.<br/><br/>Oh, sure, Bob will say he's just playing a character, but it's funny how all of his characters end up acting the same way.  Because Bob is drunk on the freedom roleplaying games provide.  If it's a western game, Bob heads straight to the saloon to shoot holes in the ceiling because he <i>can</i>.  And it doesn't matter if he originally pitched his character as a shy, retiring farm-boy getting his first taste of life away from the fields because he's drinking like a sailor on shore leave and whoring it up.<br/><br/>Bob likes attention, and his behavior reinforces that.  As GM, you're always having to go back to Bob's character to deal with his latest situation.  Bob draws away time and gaming resources because it's all about him.  Does anyone else have a certain way they'd like to play the game?  Tough, because Bob just came through like a freight train and now the town's on fire and there's a price on everybody's head. You're welcome.<br/><br/>You can't ask Bob to leave.  He's friends with Bill and he's going out with Bruno's sister, Betty.  Bob will be with you as long as you're running games.  And it doesn't much matter what you're running, as we've seen, because Bob will make <i>sure</i> it turns into <i>The Bob Show</i>.<br/><br/>So what to do about Bob?  He has to be integrated somehow because he's not going anywhere.  Bob sometimes pays for pizza, too, so he's not all bad.  When just talking to Bob outside the game he can be a fun guy, with no indication of the utter chaos he will cause the moment the dice come out.  Will talking to Bob be enough?  What if he's offended by the very suggestion that his behavior is a problem?  Remember: he's staying no matter what.  Do you <i>really</i> want to see what a pissed-off Bob will wreak upon your game?<br/><br/>Help, you hear Bob coming!  He's be at the door any minute!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245683/#Comment_245683" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T06:31:41+00:00" title="December  8, 2009  6:31AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tell Bob that his behavior is a problem and explain why.

But if it's more of an edge case, then sometimes problematic gaming is better than no gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245718/#Comment_245718" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T08:31:34+00:00" title="December  8, 2009  8:31AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did someone say Chaos?<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://nivlemspeaks.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/blood-for-the-blood-god.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb" title="Charlie Gilb"><img alt="Charlie Gilb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/1/23/2281732/Acadia%20show.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb">Charlie Gilb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245720/#Comment_245720" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T08:46:50+00:00" title="December  8, 2009  8:46AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2013 9:06AM by Charlie Gilb.">edited August 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245723/#Comment_245723" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T09:00:16+00:00" title="December  8, 2009  9:00AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite>Did someone say Chaos?</blockquote>\nKharne is totally a Bob.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245728/#Comment_245728" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T09:17:44+00:00" title="December  8, 2009  9:17AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Charlie Gilb</cite>losing her means losing my best player as well.</blockquote>Why you so sure of that?

Bob's characters usually end up providing the rest of the party with some comic relief, as they explode, fall down wells, drown in the ocean, or get serially violated by every minor fiend in the twelfth circle of the abyss. Bob challenges my spontaneity and inventiveness as a GM, and gives other players a reason to feel proud that their characters are prospering at least somewhat in the game, relatively speaking<br/><br/>Of course, all this only works if Bob has a sense of humor.

Of course this means that you only ever get to play the games that manage Bob, but that's always the case when playing with others; you can't play every game under the sky with the same people.<br/><br/>My own experience is that this can go one of two ways with Bob:\n<ul>\n<li>Play a game that accounts for Bob as a part of the game's content. For example, comedy games of various flavours will take Bob's input and celebrate it. If Bob is not just a griefer but actually likes the freedom and unexpected consequences of playing characters, then you need a game that supports that freedom, provides interesting consequences and does all this while not stomping on the fun of the other players, either. A well-managed <i>Paranoia</i> campaign works for this sort of thing, for instance. Also watch a lot of comedic anime, almost all of them have Bob-type characters in them, and that doesn't seem to detract or prevent the show from doing its own thing. This is a matter of skill and understanding the impulse, nothing more.</li>\n<li>The second tack is to play a game with very clear rules that limit Bob from expressing his impulses and ruining the game. This can also work quite well if Bob is in principle willing to adapt - if he needs the support of the system to tell him what is appropriate and what is not. This is of course just foolish if Bob refuses to cooperate, as might be the case if Bob is acting this way because it's the only sort of roleplaying he likes to do. If I had to choose a game to do this thing with, I'd probably go either with a superbly regimented thing like <i>Under the Bed</i>, or a consequence-focused game like old school <i>D&amp;D</i>. The former manages Bob by simply disallowing anything it can't handle and allowing everything Bob might think up within the rules; the latter manages Bob by having tools for providing consequences while limiting the venues of input Bob has into the game to manageable levels. (D&amp;D specifically might manage Bob by killing his character off all the time as a consequence of his foolish ways, but that's management as well, and I've met players who can enjoy it; Bob can be the running gag of the party and doesn't need to steal the show if the GM is working the rules as he should.)</li>\n</ul>\nOf course, if you can't hack this or are not interested in managing Bob, that other advice is also quite realistic in the real world (if not within the thought experiment): there is always another group. Just tell Bob that you can't handle gaming with him due to interpersonal cooperation difficulties, and let him go. In the real world this is always an option.<br/><br/>I should finish up by noting that I actually had Bob in my group for several years around the beginning of the decade. He caused some frustration and I might have handled things better, but I also could manage him in different ways, as he certainly did his best to follow clearly laid out procedural advice. Were we to play together now, I'm sure that I could do an even better job of it. The last I heard though, Bob quit the group over some inconsequential row about the 4th edition D&amp;D rules or something like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245739/#Comment_245739" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T10:00:00+00:00" title="December  8, 2009 10:00AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really surprised by all the "boot him" comments coming up straight-away, because this:<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam H</cite>Bob likes attention, and his behavior reinforces that.  As GM, you're always having to go back to Bob's character to deal with his latest situation.  Bob draws away time and gaming resources because it's all about him.  Does anyone else have a certain way they'd like to play the game?  Tough, because Bob just came through like a freight train and now the town's on fire and there's a price on everybody's head. You're welcome.</blockquote>\nis the only paragraph in the OP that actually says why Bob is a problem. Everything else is a description of a play style, and I'm nodding along, yep, I've seen it, but that's not a problem.<br/><br/>Let's be clear about something: for a lot of groups, behavior like this is a net <i>positive</i>.  Without someone to throw dynamite into the sheriff's office their games are more like those Zynga "click here to increase a status bar percentage" games. Chaotic play is fun. Nobody knows what's going to happen next.  A table with chaotic play is a table full of surprises, joy, despair and applause. Sure, sometimes it will end up being terrible, but other times it will end up being great - you know, like every other gambling game in the history of games.  Hell, for some groups that have gotten too used to each other's "moves", introducing a new chaotic player can be a shot in the arm, a zap with the defibrillator, it can bring a group back from zombie-like undeath.   <br/><br/>So a lot of people <i>love this stuff.</i>  And I am one of them sometimes.  I suspect that this group also loves this stuff sometimes.  They love this guy the way he is.  They may wish he could tone it down every once in a while, they may wish that they could have some more spotlight time, but I sincerely doubt that every single thing in a game is really about this guy's chaotic play.<br/><br/>Thus I say the following: recruit this guy.  What have you been giving him in terms of "straight men"? Do you intentionally play funny games?  Where do you intend that his energy, his celebration go?  What do you want him to do with it?  When someone strides into a saloon and starts shooting up the place and picking fights, I am laughing my ass off with glee because I've made this Western world so real to him, and so evocative to him, and he loves it so much that he can't contain himself, he's a kid in a candy store.<br/><br/>When you talk to Bob privately, don't be all "uh dude you um maybe don't fit with the group so well", be all "LOL that was frickin great, hey, I noticed some of the other players aren't really going along with what you're doing so well, maybe you could have your guy put some effort into bringing them along, or going along with them and making what they do better, you know?" or maybe "hey, what are your ideas for the next session?" and see if you can get him to brag in advance about what craziness he's thinking about.<br/><br/>What you have is not a problem with a "chaotic" playstyle (I think) - the only problem you have is that the play is running roughshod over other people's play, that he's taking too much of the spotlight. (And I would check in with the other players to be sure your perception of that is accurate - maybe they LOVE to have Bob taking the spotlight and want to see where it goes?)  That is a problem, but it's simple enough to fix. Recruit him. Make him your go-to guy for energy in the campaign.  Nobody is ever bored when he starts talking, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245748/#Comment_245748" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T10:26:04+00:00" title="December  8, 2009 10:26AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2009 10:26AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD, the original post made it clear he was problematic and you'd rather not deal with him.

It does so by making sure every player gets the spotlight, and can hold that spotlight for as long as they want; at the same time, all players can and must provide input for other players along the way. It teaches good listening and cooperation skills, and can't be played without paying close attention to other players' plots. <br/><br/>I guess Bob could crash the game by refusing to ever end his scenes, but that would mean he'd probably end up playing a solo game with no GM, in effect. No fun shouting if nobody's listening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245754/#Comment_245754" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T10:43:18+00:00" title="December  8, 2009 10:43AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Archipelago will handle this sort of stuff</blockquote>\n"Try A Different Way, Bob."<br/>"Try A <i>Different </i>Way, Bob."<br/>"Try A <b><i>Different </i></b>Way, Bob."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245782/#Comment_245782" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T11:50:52+00:00" title="December  8, 2009 11:50AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 8, 2009 11:52AM by Tristan.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lordgoon</cite>See, now, I'm actually kind of a fan of Bob's. I much prefer him to the so-called 'social gamers' who are nice to everybody but just sit there waiting to be entertained. Bob's characters usually end up providing the rest of the party with some comic relief, as they explode, fall down wells, drown in the ocean, or get serially violated by every minor fiend in the twelfth circle of the abyss. Bob challenges my spontaneity and inventiveness as a GM, and gives other players a reason to feel proud that their characters are prospering at least somewhat in the game, relatively speaking</blockquote>\nProblem is there are some Bobs that do the exact opposite thing. They bog down the play. They make the GM loose soooo much time, so there is little attention being paid to the other players. They argue with everyone so much for every little menial detail that in the end you'd rather have him has his way with things than arguing endlessly with such a stubborn person...<br/><br/>We had this sort of Roberta once. Problem was she was the GM's girlfriend.<br/><br/>My brother preferred to stop playing. I stopped enjoying play. Everyone was getting really jaded by her behavior... Then she and the GM broke up. Problem was the GM (who, incidentally, is my cousin) was already burnt out by this time, and he has not been very interested in the game afterward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245798/#Comment_245798" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-08T13:03:10+00:00" title="December  8, 2009  1:03PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh lord.<br/>I have bobbed a whole bunch in games.<br/>Because I have a pretty tenuous grasp on cause &amp; effect, and am actually not very good at portraying a character in a realistic fashion.<br/><br/>Sometimes, my fellow players get annoyed with me for dicking around and taking chaotic actions and fabricating nonsensical plans.<br/>It's... sucky to feel attacked for something I'm trying to control.<br/><br/>Providing social tools for Bob would be a nice way to try and move forward.<br/>Especially because it comes across as trying to read him charitably.<br/>Something like, "Bob, that feels a bit far-fetched.

I'M ROLLING DICE NOW, LOOK AT THEIR RESULTS!"<br/><br/>Just say "We'll get to that in a bit Bob, it's still Alice, Carol and Eve's scene, and you're somewhere else completely."<br/><br/>If the PCs are together, and Bob does something crazy, just turn to them and ask "So, hey, Bob's about to take a dump in the punchbowl, how are you guys going to react to that?"<br/><br/>Consider asking his IC motivations when stuff like this happens. "You're going to take a dump in the punchbowl? Why?"<br/><br/>Or inform him of the consequences. "You realize that the queen's not gonna take kindly to that, and there are a lot of guards at an important diplomatic incident like this. You think your allies will have your back if you do something crazy like that? Do you want to play 'dude rotting in a jail cell with nothing fun to do' that much? I'm not trying to single you out or say what you can and can't do, but it just seems like a really bad idea and the rewards aren't all that great, y'know?"<br/><br/>But, above all else, talk to Bob about it in general. I mean, it can be a little bit uncomfortable calling out friends like that, but if you worry about it enough to post to SG looking for a solution, it would probably be worth it letting Bob know you have a problem in the first place. For all we know, Bob is just like DWeird, going "MOAR KAOS" and being <i>baffled</i> that there are people who don't find that fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
