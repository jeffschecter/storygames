However, I have a hard time coming up with a plot hook beyond "your child/spouse/parent/etc. has been taken by nightmares! Go get her/him!". Perhaps this is just a massive failure of imagination on my part, easily remedied by a bit of brainstorming, but I'd like to hear your ideas. How do you encourage player buy in when playing DRYH?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392578/#Comment_392578" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-06T19:36:14+00:00" title="October  6, 2012  7:36PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>The players write their own plot hooks -- that's what the 'What just happened?' (and 'What is my story?' or whatever it's called) question is for?<br/><br/>Everything the GM does in the first hour or two of DRYH should come straight from the character sheets. Their madness talents, their regular talents, their question answers -- all you do from there is embellish, mix and match, and amp up the horror/madness whenever it makes sense.<br/><br/>Maybe at that point you might think about bringing in additional elements, whole cloth, but in general I don't find that it's necessary at all. I don't even use the setting from the book -- all that stuff just gets in the way of whatever personal horror the player has seeded with their initial answers.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_392579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392579/#Comment_392579" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-06T19:43:43+00:00" title="October  6, 2012  7:43PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2012 7:44PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To maybe be a bit more concrete, a classic 'hook' that I use quite frequently is the premise that the PC's madness talents are uniquely useful -- either they are the only person who can do that or they are exceptionally good at doing that or the thing they can do is exceptionally valuable to the people/things on the other side of the city.<br/><br/>So for example, a game where a PC has chosen the ability to dilate time (make it pass much slower or faster) as their madness talent: everyone in the Other City carries a stopwatch that dictates not only what time of day it is, but also their social class, likely futures, jobs or tasks they must perform, etc. The city is strongly clock-themed and run by beings obsessed by the rectitude of time. The PC is quickly sought out by denizens who want him to 'hack' their watches. <br/><br/>Basically, in this version of Don't Rest Your Head, the awakened (i.e. PCs) are <i>resources</i> that the nightmare-denizens are interested in <i>exploiting</i>. They do so by taking advantage of the PCs' naivete and cluelessness about how things really work. They ask the PCs to do things that seem simple, but are actually very dangerous. They act as though the rest of the PC's life is irrelevant, now that they have manifested their great talent. They exalt or debase the PC, they hunt them, they involve them in conspiracies, etc.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moyashi" title="Moyashi"><img alt="Moyashi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moyashi">Moyashi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392582/#Comment_392582" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-06T20:01:45+00:00" title="October  6, 2012  8:01PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ICE, thank you.

Better run.<br/><br/>Your collection of original first-edition books by Jorge Luis Borges has been missing only a single volume for years. An anonymous letter arrived on your doorstep the other day, telling you if you were interested in acquiring a copy, to meet them at a certain location downtown, at 13 PM. 13 PM? Do they mean 1 AM maybe? Or meant to type midnight?<br/><br/>When you open your eyes, after having failed to get to sleep <i>again</i>, you find yourself in an unfamiliar hotel room.
