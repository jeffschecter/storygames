However, I sent my Pc's to the Plane of Elemental Chaos at level 1 and that's somewhat of a fact hanging over everyone's head, along with several oz references (farm house sent via tornado, they landed on a which, there's four of them ,etc) <br/><br/>So they managed to get to the City of Brass without slavery or dying. <br/><br/>What I would like you to do, is tell me how you would go about preparing for this city in your system of choice (you dont have to actually do it, just tell me how you would, but see below)<br/><br/>Bonus points if you actually do it. <br/><br/>Consider this a jubilee of game systems, lets get some interfaith dialog going...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Willow" title="Willow"><img alt="Willow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Willow">Willow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251215/#Comment_251215" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-17T18:51:12+00:00" title="January 17, 2010  6:51PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In D&amp;D 4th, which of course you're actually playing, I'd stat some level appropriate encounters.  If they're still at the heroic tier, then probably the sort of stuff they've been fighting already, or maybe escaped slaves or something (gives you a chance to use the humanoids you haven't been using.)<br/><br/>In Dogs in the Vineyard, of course, I'd create the town.  It starts with Pride and goes all the way down- an efretti lord is probably plotting against his kin, and from that there's lots of sex, treachery, and abyssal influence.<br/><br/>In Escape from Tentacle City, I wouldn't prep at all, except to consider the ramifications of a fire-tentacle apocalypse adds.  (The tentacles also light you on fire when they hit you.)  Since there's no GM, and no prep.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251217/#Comment_251217" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-17T19:34:34+00:00" title="January 17, 2010  7:34PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Baron Munchausen was personally welcomed to the City of Brass by the Efritti Sulitan himself, but when the good Baron committed the faux pas of enjoying his cup of fermented molten gold even more than the Sulitan, he was forced to fight his way out. He single-handedly defeated the entire royal guard, only dying twice.<br/><br/>The 3:16 found that a civilization had somehow established itself on a molten, volcanic world. Any life form that could manage to thrive in such a hostile environment would cause problems if it were ever allowed to get near a human settlement. Dozens of troopers were reduced to cinders before intelligence reports revealed that the hostiles possessed the power to grant wishes. The civilization was subsequently nuked from orbit.<br/><br/>In the end, it hardly mattered that one of the last Knights of Polaris waded through the demons in the City of Brass and shattered the foundation of the Sultan's palace, for that all happened long ago, and now there are none who remember it.<br/><br/>The Mouse Guard was eventually able to re-establish the trade route to the City of Brass Lantern, but not before weasel saboteurs kidnapped the mayor.<br/><br/>In Misery Bubblegum, the human exchange students to City of Brass High learn that even immortals go through an awkward adolescent period.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251219/#Comment_251219" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-17T20:49:19+00:00" title="January 17, 2010  8:49PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I'd probably start with some Quests.<br/><br/>Finding who killed the witch and bringing them to justice might be fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251223/#Comment_251223" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-17T22:18:58+00:00" title="January 17, 2010 10:18PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been running a 4th edition D&amp;D game set in the City of Brass for some time now, actually.  It's heroic tier, so efreeti themselves are background elements rather than directly involved in the plots.  Prep is usually as described: create a few encounter groups, largely composed of other creatures living in the CoB.  And consider how living in a world made of fire changes a humanoid race's outlook.  Plots and ideas boil out from there.<br/><br/><br/>In Nobilis, the City of Brass would make a perfect Chancel for the Powers of Fire, Magic, Metal, Cunning and Slavery, or some such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251341/#Comment_251341" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-18T23:04:19+00:00" title="January 18, 2010 11:04PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In <i>Power Kill</i>, we'd start by working on getting you to take responsibility for the feverish, TB-racked homeless guy you and your associates kept stuffing into a "magical" refrigerator box over the course of a week.
