I never found a chance to play Vampire as I imagined I would have liked, a social political game/feeding frenzy on the surface of inhuman monsters.<br/><br/>So, anyway, I was driving to school last night and I thought of Vampires in the \xc6lysium. Why \xc6 instead of E? Well, only because it spells out Vitae, which I remember being the V:tM word for blood.<br/><br/>Vit\xc6<br/>You are the Children of Cain, and enforce his laws and edicts to keep his Blood safe in the dark world - safe from themselves and the human sheep they feed on. You aren't the Masquerade - you're what keeps the Masquerade working. Is the Prince of Seattle failing to keep her city in line? Has the Toreador made slaves of the Brujah in Toronto? Do humans know too much in Silicon Valley? Bring them in line, bring judgement. You are Lilith's Brood, and you bring Cain's vision of the world into reality. And, no one can question your interpretation of that vision.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104960/#Comment_104960" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-26T06:17:42+00:00" title="October 26, 2007  6:17AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ive often wondered how the progression of sins would look in a Vampire version of DitV.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104961/#Comment_104961" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-26T06:22:51+00:00" title="October 26, 2007  6:22AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd assume it would take a bit to look at the 'rules of the Masquerade' and possibly synthesize them with the new Vampire game or the cool ones in Vampire the Dark Ages.

Going with the Camarilla, the PCs are obviously Justicars/Archons who go around enforcing the traditions and spreading the law and news of the Camarilla.

Because I only own VtR and VII (because it was so awesome) for the new Vampire stuff.  Oh and obsessively collected and played VtM for several years, which is really what I'm going off of - the absorbed memory of that.<br/><br/>Which ever way you approach it, you're going to want to leave room to be flexible. You're going to be breaking establish setting canon in some way, so books beyond the basics largely won't help.  You'll want room for you and players to ad-lib new stuff. And the supplements mostly focus on minutia of setting for exploration.  Look at how much setting info there is in Dogs.  You won't need much.<br/><br/>I think you'll be okay with VtM (any edition), V:tDA or DA:V, or VtR + Dogs in the Vineyard - depending on what setting you want to go for.  Maybe even the LARP books (I know nothing about these).  Guide to the Camarilla and Invictus or Lancea Sanctum might help too.<br/><br/>I think I'm just rambling now, so I'll break it down:<br/>For VtM style setting, which I would go with since it's just fits so well: Track down any edition of <i>Vampire: The Masquerade</i>, and either Vampire: Player's Guide (1st or 2nd edition, not revised! very important) or Guide to Camarilla.  If you are not familiar, the Vampire Players Guide for Revised is actually more of a book for the GM.  Guide to Camarilla is like the earlier Player Guides, but with more focus on the Camarilla, naturally.  It's a long story as to why that is.  But it looks like you can get the revised stuff without breaking the bank (according to Amazon's marketplace) so that's an option.  Regardless, I'd get the same edition of whatever books you are getting.  And you should be fine with 2nd edition (if you can find it), I lean toward Revised because the Camarilla Guide I think will be better for you, and the corebook has all the clans, including the independent and Sabbat clans (although less important since they aren't a separate group now) for non-Faithful flavor.<br/><br/><i>Vampire: The Requiem</i> is much easier to get a hold of.  Lancea Sanctum, being a religious covenant, is probably a better fit for Dogs style play, so I'd suggest the VtR core book and <i>Lancea Sanctum</i> if you need it.  Since these books are easier to get a hold of, just start with the core book and if you find you want more info then pick up Lancea later.  Forget the <i>VII</i> book entirely.  I would just make VII like the Gods Watchdogs except flavored for a Vampire psuedo-Christian religion. Forget what the core says about them, for this they are a subsect of the Sanctum.  The rest of the Vampire society doesn't know it, which is why there's so many rumors about them, but all the members of Lancea Sanctum know the truth.<br/><br/>The trick is both games focus a lot on politics and unlife, and not so much on Tradition violation.  So, while that's a lot of grist for the mill, even in these alternate pairs of books, there's not a whole lot you need to flesh out what you need for a DitV mod, which I think is just fine since you shouldn't need much.  Most World of Darkness setting books would just be overkill.<br/><br/>Hell, you might be able to get by with Vampire: The Requiem For Dummies.  Yes, it exists, but take that advice with a huge grain of salt - it probably doesn't focus that much on setting information.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_105069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105069/#Comment_105069" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-26T15:59:32+00:00" title="October 26, 2007  3:59PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite><br/>I know that VII has its own book, what other books would you suggest I mine for ideas?</blockquote>\nAs an old Vampire hand (also known in the UK as a "wanker"), I'd encourage you to look for the 2nd Edition Core book for Vampire: the Masquerade.  Well-written, very evocative, and it implies much more than it spells out.  At that point in the game's evolution, the Sabbat were pretty much the "Orcs over the hill" of the setting, and all the action revolved around the machinations within the Camarilla and especially within the conflicts between clans and individuals in specific cities.  <br/><br/>Second best is Vampire: the Requiem, which kind of takes the vampire concept back to its roots, except with less flair and better mechanics (which you don't care about anyway).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_105076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/105076/#Comment_105076" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-26T20:01:59+00:00" title="October 26, 2007  8:01PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome everyone, thanks for the help!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
