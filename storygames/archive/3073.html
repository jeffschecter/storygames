I listen to a wide range of music, I still go to gigs, I read one or two books a week, I love movies and there are tons of great series on TV.<br/><br/>But, and here's the thing, rpgs are more fun than any of that stuff.<br/><br/>You hang out with friends, you have something to eat, have a laugh, have an adventure, it's just the coolest thing.<br/><br/>That, and here's the real killer app, you help create what happens.  Whether it's some groundbreakingly innovative concept or whether you are part of a motley band of adventurers including an elf, a dwarf and a not-a-hobbit-honest off to save your land from some great and prophecied evil, it's you doing it.  It's not a character on screen, it's not a protagonist from a book, it's you right there with your buds creating something unique (if not necessarily remotely original) right there and then, and having a hell of a lot of fun while doing it.<br/><br/>Coolest hobby ever.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm off for about six months and I wanted to post before I went something just to say, this hobby seriously fucking rocks.  If you're of a mood, you might wish to post why you feel the same yourself.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70433/#Comment_70433" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T07:24:59+00:00" title="May 19, 2007  7:24AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And here's what I wrote in another forum...<br/><br/>When I was a kid, what I think I enjoyed most about RPGs was the freedom. You could make your own adventures, and you could (as in the standard answer to the outsider question "what do you do?"), do "anything", because the rules weren't prescriptive the way they are in boardgames.<br/><br/>Now that I'm back in RPGs, I find I'm much more appreciative of the people themselves. RPGs are great because they're a pastime where people entertain each other, enjoy each other, and make their own fun instead of depending on someone they don't know to provide it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_S" title="Aaron_S"><img alt="Aaron_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/780/nLP7HPA6K2AES.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_S">Aaron_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70452/#Comment_70452" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T08:58:08+00:00" title="May 19, 2007  8:58AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I second Elliot's childhood remembrance. The freedom to "do anything" still stirs up a kind of childlike wonder.<br/><br/>More recently (specifically since purchasing <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> last year at Origins), I and my players have taken our first steps into a new realm of play. And although I had been lurking at The Forge for years, <i>DitV</i> really made a lot of the abstract concepts come alive in play. Kudos to Vincent for presenting such an eminently playable game. Our group has played four or five games, and this was by far the most rewarding experience.<br/><br/>I'm currently trying to incorporate the concepts of Conflict Resolution (players-in-control) into a setting I've been kicking around for a few years now. We'll see how that goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70455/#Comment_70455" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T09:10:03+00:00" title="May 19, 2007  9:10AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good question.  <br/><br/>When I'm playing an RPG I feel more free to open up.  To be more outgoing.  To connect strongly with the other players.  I feel the freedom to perform and entertain without embarrassment.  And, when I do well at entertaining you, I get immediate feedback.  You don't even have to open your mouth to tell me if I've entertained you or not.  I can tell by the look in your eyes and the way you're reaching for your dice.  Similarly, if I fail at entertaining you, I know that I'm only minutes away from redemption.  I will have many more chances to bring the awesome, no matter how long or short the session.<br/><br/>That's why I love RPGs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70507/#Comment_70507" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T13:24:32+00:00" title="May 19, 2007  1:24PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All of the above, and...<br/><br/>you know that Go Play sticker? The concept of it works because you can totally connect with absolute strangers over gaming. I can say, "Really, you game too?" They could say they play motherfuckin' Vampire LARP and we'd still be carrying a conversation and sharing in a culture.<br/><br/>The reason I loved Gencon was that it was thousands upon thousands of people who "got it". Not a lot of them did indie RPG gaming, but that never left me feeling isolated. In the pizza line-up I got talking to someone who works on hte Pokemon CCG and he said, "Yeah, man, I absolutely love what I do, and my job pushes me in all the right directions." I told him that was awesome, shook his hand, and really meant it.<br/><br/>I've only ever played the Pokemon CCG once, and that was with an 8 year-old cousin.<br/><br/>I'm sure that if that dude said he worked for Pokemon and loved it to a random stranger in teh pizza line-up elsewhere, he'd be mocked or something retarded like that.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is that I feel like I have a huge family. It's a family I'm proud of, and it's a family I want to share with others. It doesn't matter who they are, where they're from... shit, even what they play. At the end of the day, we're all going to go play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70568/#Comment_70568" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T22:42:35+00:00" title="May 19, 2007 10:42PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The one thing I've always liked doing best, for as long as my memory reaches back, was making up stories.<br/><br/>Doing that with a bunch of other neat people, jiving off and supporting each other, and coming out with something I couldn't expect before it started?
