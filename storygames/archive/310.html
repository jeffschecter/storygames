                            If what you want is to build up a sense of Being There, rolling to lift the thingy is something you want modelled, because not all people can lift all thingies. One wants to be measured against the universe.<br/>

You may never lift a thingy in-game, but you want the possibility to be real.                        </div>

                            And I get that, Shreyas -- Task Resolution as a subset of Conflict Resolution makes all sorts of sense.  In some situations, it makes more sense than just Conflict Resolution with no Task subsystem.<br/>
<br/>
But I'm curious about Task Resolution all on its own.  What's it good for?  For Being There?  Perhaps.  What else?                        </div>

<p>Regardless of the status of a conflict, a player has asked for something to happen, and the system should help us figure out: what happens next? What is the outcome of this action? There can be times that a given action doesn't purely matter to a larger conflict (at least not without much stretching) but people want SOME answer to it, if only to frame the rest of their contributions to the fiction.</p>
<p>As an example, just as we were starting a Dogs healing conflict a player asked: is his heart beating? (Did the fall stop his heart etc?) One answer to this was for me, the GM, to make something up, to give him a frame for the actions; another was to ask the player to decide what he saw so that he could work it into the raise (but this wasn't a good idea at thetime). Another way could have been to have some mechanic to tell me what happened, just to judge the terrain for the conflict - were the Dogs patching bones are desperately trying to get is heart beating again? (Not a perfect example, since in this case me making a decision would have been better than using a mechanic, but it's the example that comes to mind.)</p>
<p>In any case: there are lots of uncertain things that happen in the fiction that do not fit cleanly into a conflict.</p>

                            In the context of Story Games, I'm not sure there's a good reason for task resolution.<br/><br/>For some forms of "sim" (modulo my understanding and or the legitimacy of the concept), task resolution is useful, as others have said, because it supports the idea of "being there". That is, we can view achieving any complex goal as the product of a series of tasks. Our intentions form the goal, but our intellect guides our manipulation of the external world in an effort to achieve the goal.<br/><br/>Task resolution represents a viewpoint of emergent reality constrained by the physical world. Conflict resolution by contrast is the direct manipulation of metaphysical ideals.<br/><br/>Task resolution is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominalism" rel="nofollow">Nominalism</a>, conflict resolution <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_realism" rel="nofollow">Realism.</a> </div>

                            Task rolls absolutely can have no bearing on conflict resolution.<br/>
Real-world recent hideous example: The game is Shadowrun. Player A wants to use his gun to blast open a safe to get the Stuff inside. The GM calls for a roll. Not only did the GM know he was calling for a trivial roll (the player had something like a 1 in 2^6 chance in failing), but he would have given the player the Stuff even if he had failed, either through another roll or through fiat. Task rolls in this situation have no role in resolving the potential conflict at hand.<br/>
<br/>
On a more theoretical level:<br/>
I think it might have been on Anyway, but I read a definition of a conflict, in terms of a CR system, that defined it as consisting of two elements: a desire and an opposition. I really like this cross-section of a conflict, and it has done a lot to inform how I think while running a game.<br/>
<br/>
In this model, there absolutely are task rolls that are not a subset of any sort of CR. Any time the desire of a player is not matched by an opposition from the GM, there is no conflict to resolve, so no task roll could result in conflict resolution.                        </div>

Hm.  I hate trivial rolls (like Albert's example) and repeated rolls.  However, I'm fine with the GM being arbitrator of the results of rolls -- as long as there is strong encouragement that rolls aren't trivial or uselessly repeated.  I find that having a single point of responsibility for rolls is fine, particularly compared to having a group debate every time you roll the dice over what that die roll means.                        </div>

                            So, are we trying to figure out if TR, in all games, is always a form of covert CR-by-personal-fiat? E.g., even if the GM has no say, suppose the player himself is going through a solitaire module and gives himself permission to use a particular sequence of skills (say, Throwing for a grappling hook, followed by Climbing) to go up a cliff. Or even if the module explicitly states the tasks that can contribute to climbing the cliff. Is that CR?<br/><br/>If so, I'd say that distinguishing overt CR from covert CR masquerading as TR is a matter of aesthetic and philosophical perspective--the same thing as deciding whether the idea of a mechanical "model" of reality has any validity in the context of a game. I think it does, but not in all games.                        </div>

                            Well, yes, I like to have definitive answers and have things move along.  This can be done a variety of ways either inside the mechanics or through some combination of the mechanics and social contract.  This can be done in GURPS, Dogs, or whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
Having a single point of responsibility means that if the definitive answers suck, then at least I have a person whom I hold responsible for it.  Group responsibility can be nice and hippy-ish, but it's a bitch to fix if it's broken.  Consensus mechanics generally boil down to the whiniest person winning, because they're the last ones to agree.  They might eventually be kicked out of the group for whininess, but until then they have the advantage.                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  I don't think of it as TR vs. CR... It's like saying which tool is better a hammer or a screwdriver? Depends on what you are doing.<br/>
  TR is about knowing what you are rolling for before you roll the Dice<br/>
  TR is about using the tools in your toolbox in an unexpected way<br/>
  TR is about living in the setting, not creating it<br/>
<br/>
  I don't think TR is right for every game, but it is not the bane of all roleplayers' existance either, lol<br/>
<br/>
  Well, I prolly didn;t sell ya on it, but hopefully highlighted what it's good for...<br/>

                            At this point, I'm firmly in the "I see no reason to play any game without conflict resolution," mainly because of my conviction that the majority of boring play centers around useless TR rolls.<br/>
<br/>
Now, many fine CR systems incorporate TR into them, which is all good. I personally want to do something with my next project that really elegantly links TR outcomes into the CR of the game. But TR alone? Not for me, baby.<br/>
<br/>
I will say that, while TR may be good for some Sim play, it's not necessary or appropriate for all Sim play, by any means.                        </div>

                            Hi!<br/>
  Well, since I have been exposed to CR, I've not had a chance to try it with my group, but the way I understand it is:<br/>
1) Frame a scene<br/>
2) Decide what each player wants<br/>
3) Use abilities, traits, etc to figure out how you are going to get it<br/>
4) Roll them bones<br/>
5) Decide/narrate what actually happens<br/>
<br/>
  What does TR do different? Well, firstly, you know what you are rolling for before you roll the dice. All I know is I want to open that safe. Before I roll, I know what is at stake, and generally don't need to worry about super unexpected results.<br/>
<br/>
  TR also lets you combine stuff on your sheet to make something new and unexpected. Not that you can't do this with CR, but CR relies more on creativity and less on combinations.<br/>
<br/>
  Finally, most CR systems allow you to author a little bit of the world if you succeed in the conflict. While most TR systems are about taking action in the setting presented.<br/>
<br/>
  Don't get mwe wrong, I like both systems and imagine you cna use either in any setting, but the game you have when it is written is going to be different.<br/>

  Cool! Good idea. I didn't even know it existed. The problem with my group is, they are all casual gamers. I don't think I could get them pumped up enough to try a more narrativist system without having a drop-dead, knockout game. And I just haven't found one yet.<br/>
  Dogs seems like it might be cool, but I dunno if they'll go for a Western. PTA sounds like it might be cool, but I don't know enough about the rules. And I dunno if Sorcerer is CR or something else...<br/>
  I'll definitely check it out, thanks.<br/>

                            Josh,<br/><br/>I appreciate what you're saying, but there's more to it than that.<br/><br/>Unless I'm missing something, conflict resolution isn't definitionally free of the need for GM discretion or open discussion. Stakes in Dogs or TSoY both need to be negotiated. My Life with Master is <i>close</i> to not needing discretion, but not 100% there. <i>Polaris</i> is kinda there, kinda not.<br/><br/>So I'm going to go back my understanding of TR as Nominalism and CR as Realism. TR is all about mechanically creating a plausible chain of causation underlying a given outcome. CR is about creating a chain of signification. It operates on ideas, not facts.<br/><br/>So the <i>advantage</i> of task resolution is that it supports the illusion of reality by operating, so far as possible, "inside" the fictional world. This is true even if task resolution is really only a component of conflict resolution.<br/><br/>(You can see this aspect of task resolution very clearly if you go back to the 'wargame roots". In a game of <i>Panzerblitz</i>, the conflict is the entire scenario. There is no overall resolution to the question of "do the Germans capture the village" outside of the workings of the individual events--fire combat, movement, etc. The answer to the question is an emergent property of the mechanics, instead of being directly determined.)                        </div>

                            Hm.  <br/><br/>If I make an intelligent write-up of Legolas in a decent system (i.e. not Decipher's crappy LOTR system), then he'll never fail to hit a target unless it's some ridiculous distance, the target is super-fast, he's blinded, or similar.  It sounds like you're mixing up "first level syndrome" with Task Resolution in general.  There are a lot of RPGs which set up the PCs as closer to average Joes than legendary heroes.  There's a place for each, but you shouldn't mistake one for the other.  Your D&amp;D or RuneQuest character isn't Legolas.  <br/><br/>If you want your character to have legendary skill in something, you have to give him an extraordinary skill value.  This might sound obvious, but it's important.  He may miss, but it will only be under extreme circumstances -- and in those cases it will be because of circumstances beyond his control, not because he suddenly lost his skill.  (Few games, even indie ones, discuss how to narrate in detail.  Theatrix had a good section on describing success and failure, emphasizing how failure by skilled people should be due to unforeseeable circumstances rather than personal failure.)  <br/><br/>The narration of success and failure can be tricky, but that's not particular to Task Resolution either.  Anyone can narrate badly.  For example, if you try shooting at me in Dogs, I get to narrate how I dodge.  I could easily say "I casually sidestep out of the way of your arrow." with my See.  It's up to whoever's narrating to make sure that the result is appropriate.  <br/><br/>Lastly, if you want to talk about the lack of <i>realism</i> of Task Resolution, then I think your Legolas example doesn't particularly help.                        </div>

<p>John, your post pretty much comes off as though you are assuming I have exactly zero idea what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>I'll assume that this is my misinterpretation, as I'd rather not start a fight about it.</p>
<p>Responding to your points in reverse--</p>
<p>"Realism" is a poisonous mis-choice of words that should be "plausibility", I think. I'm frankly disinterested in resolving tasks based on how I think works in "real life", because basically any task that I will want to resolve is going to be in a context I have no real-life knowledge about. I'm more interested in resolving things such that they occur in a way that doesn't make me think, "Hm, the system did something wrong there."</p>
<p>Regarding first-level syndrome, okay, that example is not great for that. You're running off with assuming that that is the whole of my complaint, however, when it is, in fact, that every task resolution system I have encountered is inadequate to represent <em>this thing I am having a hard time phrasing.</em></p>
<p>Let me try another example.</p>
<p>We have two characters, Ethan and Julia, at high school.</p>
<p>The facts of their social situation are that Julia can openly argue with teachers, and they will engage her in argument. Even if she advances some ridiculously flawed argument, the teacher will respond to it as though they are engaged in a debate - that is, they will pick it apart logically. There aren't disciplinary consequences for her.</p>
<p>Whereas, Ethan's situation is such that he'll get sent to detention, regardless of the value of the point he makes.</p>
<p>How do I represent this in a task resolution system?</p>

                            (Jumping past the back &amp; forth between John &amp; Shreyas just to say...)<br/>
<br/>
Josh, point of clarification. I'm saying that Task resolution is like the philosophical concept of Nominalism while Conflict resolution is like Realism.<br/>
<br/>
That may seem backward to what I'm saying but it's because the terms themselves have a counterintuitive history.<br/>
<br/>
As for your followup question, speaking from personal preference, the benefit is twofold. For an agenda that doesn't especially value a storylike portrayal of the game-world, the small-r realism supported by task resolution is an end in itself. For an agenda that does value the storylike portrayal, the small-r realism still may have the benefit of verisimilitude (note: personal perspective) which supports buy-in.<br/>
<br/>
I'm probably also leaving out the benefit of task resolution to the gamist impulse. In a nutshell, competitive strategy and tactics are about creatively putting together small things to make big things in unobvious ways. Task resolution gives you the "parts" that you can recombine.                        </div>

So this is a system that only exists in my head.<br/>
<br/>
Let's say you have a system where your task and conflict resolutions are totally orthogonal.<br/>
<br/>
Let's further say that the conflict resolution system has determined that your character is going to get into the castle.<br/>
<br/>
You roll for your task resolution!  You try to climb over the wall, but you fail, so you fall down and splash! in the moat, where you meet a friendly fish who shows you the way into the castle.  The task resolution results (failed climbing, positive social) are cool color for your ultimate conflict resolution.<br/>

The thingy could be the trapdoor by which you planned to sneak into the tower where the prince(ss) is held. Failure requires you to find another way which in some cases can be an enjoyable &amp;  creative challenge.<br/>
<br/>
The thingy could be a trapdoor you thought led into the tower's celler but actually opens to a shadowy tomb or enticing rabbit hole. Success tempts you to let the prince(ss) cool their heels for a while why you explore (and possibly abandon the prince(ss) story line entirely.)<br/>
<br/>
The thingy could be the bleeding body of another character. Success in lifting gives you a new choice of abandoning the struggle with the tower guards  -- and the prince(ss) -- to carry your friend to safety. <br/>
<br/>
The thingy could be a toppled slab crushing another character. Life and death rests on a dice roll forced on you by events.<br/>
<br/>
The thing could be a crate, and underneath is a smaller hidden thingy that has nothing to do with the prince(ss)' plight but tells you something about the history of the tower.<br/>
<br/>
The thingy could be a crate  -- and there's nothing beneath.<br/>
<br/>
Resolutions of tasks encountered 'along the way' to the main conflict can be meaningless and boring, but it can also be a source of interesting tangents, challenge, dramatic tension, and color.                        </div>

                            A possible explanation for (though not a defense of) Task Resolution that seems pointless after the fact: it may be an artifact of Illusionism.<br/><br/>That is, it may not be clear to the players that the task is trivial and/or unrelated to the conflict, and the GM may want to keep it that way. A prime example of this is the search check. Think of a game with mechanics to determine the results of a search. If players declare that their characters search an area, then - when the GM  says, "you don't find anything," it means something very different to the <i>players</i> depending upon whether or not those mechanics were used and, if so, what the outcome of the use of those mechanics was.                        </div>

<p>To me, TR-without-CR is some rules that help you figure out which stuff enters the fiction, specifically when there isn't a good conflict involved. Why does this stuff matter if there isn't a clear conflict? Perhaps just a differing aesthetic/simmy vision of what should happen next, or perhaps it's necessary for framing what's going on such that you CAN establish a conflict. "Just say yes" is one approach to this issue, and having TR is another.</p>
<p>So in Ben's example, of climbing the wall to get into the castle: is it a conflict yet? Sure, you can roll this into a larger "Do you get into the castle?" conflict, and if that's what matters you SHOULD. But if this is NOT an important conflict, and rather simply something in the fiction to resolve, than TR is better to use rather than distorting what conflict should mean.</p>
<p>Heck, here's some TR to tack onto Dogs! If a player wants to see what is the outcome of a Dog doing something, and if no other player wants to make this a Conflict, she can just roll the traits she wants and take the highest two to compare ot a task number of her own choosing. If its larger than some number it happens one way, or otherways it happens another.</p>
<p>So look at the above. Is this bad? I can see no way this will interfere with actual CR (since any player, GM included, can make this a Conflict). Perhaps you can argue this mechanic doesn't belong in the larger text, since it takes some focus away from the conflict-driven nature of the game. But I say you can easily argue the opposite, and this does not interfere.</p>

                            I think it all comes down to immersion. Droog hit on it with "Being There" in the first response but I don't think he really made the point, so I'm gonna try. <br/><br/>Premise 1: When you're playing in an immersive mode, Director stance blows it for you. You want to be "I" and not be playing "my guy" or "that guy." <br/><br/>Premise 2: Conflict resolution requires Director stance. To think about what you, the player, want out of the situation, you must step outside the character and think at a macro level. <br/><br/>Conclusion: Conflict resolution kills immersion.<br/><br/>Conflict resolution does not lend itself to translating the wishes of the player in an immersive Actor stance as well as task resolution. To resolve a situation with conflict resolution, the player first must step back, determine what he (the player, not the character) wants to occur, then roll, then translate back into immersive terms. The back and forth transition derails immersion.<br/><br/>Task resolution, on the other hand, relates directly to what characters are doing, even if it doesn't matter to the story or the players. There's less translation. You, as immersive player, act through your character in the game-world. <i>Someone else</i> translates the action into dice. You roll. <i>Someone else</i> interprets the dice and translates that into game-world results. You don't break immersion except to toss a D20 or whatever. If the game is like Dogs and it requires you to play poker dice or something very-much-not-related to your character, that blows your immersion, too.<br/><br/>Really, it requires a certain amount of hubris to say that rolling to see if you get drunk doesn't matter to the players. They obviously think it matters, or they wouldn't do it. Maybe you can't fathom enjoying that game, but as long as they're having fun, cool.<br/><br/>(I'm actually not an immersive player, but I understand them, I think.)                        </div>

                            I am intrigued by Ben's idea for orthogonal task and conflict resolution, with CR resolving "what happens" and TR resolving "how it happens."  And the TR aspect doesn't just have to be color; it can be fundamental to the Premise of the game, e.g., "Is it better to be good or to be lucky?"<br/>
<br/>
CR and TR might not be totally orthogonal in such a game; maybe successes at TR in earlier conflicts might provide an advantage in later instances of CR.  But the principle is quite cool.                        </div>

                            OK, I'm going to try answering Shreyas' example here.  I think concrete examples are good here, because I think when talking about broad categories (like Task vs Conflict), there's a lot of potential for miscommunication.  <br/><br/><b>Shreyas Sampat</b> wrote:
<blockquote>We have two characters, Ethan and Julia, at high school.<br/><br/>The facts of their social situation are that Julia can openly argue with teachers, and they will engage her in argument. Even if she advances some ridiculously flawed argument, the teacher will respond to it as though they are engaged in a debate - that is, they will pick it apart logically. There aren't disciplinary consequences for her.<br/><br/>Whereas, Ethan's situation is such that he'll get sent to detention, regardless of the value of the point he makes.<br/><br/>How do I represent this in a task resolution system?</blockquote>
Well, the obvious thing that leaps to mind for me is a Reputation modifier.  I believe this originally appeared in GURPS, but it has been imitated in many games since then.  In GURPS this would be something like "Reputation: trouble-maker -6 (14-) to teachers".  The limited category of the reputation reduces it's value.  The result is that the game mechanics are that the teacher is hostile to Ethan.  (That is, there are a set of relation states like Friendly, Neutral, etc.  The reputation downgrades that.)  The hostile state is a directive for how the GM should have the NPC behave, and I believe a modifier for social skill rolls.  <br/><br/>Note, I'm not arguing you should like this, but rather I'm answering how I would approach this in a Task Resolution system.  <br/><br/>It's not perfect, but it's not terrible.  And to be fair, I'd also be stuck as to how to represent this in many Conflict Resolution systems.  For example, The Pool and Dogs don't have negative traits -- a relationship or reputation always helps you succeed.  If his player makes a conflict of it, there's a good chance that Ethan won't get sent to detention.                        </div>

                            Wow, all sorts of responses, now.<br/><br/>Ben, part of my interest here is to gauge whether TR has any use or place outside of CR.  So while my gut agrees with you in principle, I'm curious to see if other people see things in a different way.  I mean, the more I think about TR and CR the more I dislike both and am more interested in managing scenes and situation directly.  So before I just discount it all, I want to see what other people find it useful for.  Color, apparently, for you.<br/><br/>Entailments for Elliot, and that I find interesting -- the side-effect stuff that is not a direct product of the conflict.  Losing hit points, gaining traits, earning enmity, unforeseen consequences of your particular address, and the like.  See this I can use, and I'd be interested to hear more about how TR can produce results in addition to whatever conflict they seem to be pursuing.<br/><br/>I do think that TR can probably trace most of its lineage to illusionist practices <em>which isn't necessarily a bad thing</em>.  Increasing the suspence of the players is certainly an effect of TR rolls, although I don't know if that is properly the <em>function</em> of TR rolls.  On the other hand, it's a trivial matter to <em>make</em> that their function, too.<br/><br/>Dev, I'd hate to play that Dogs game, because yeah, the whole point would be diluted in silly rolls that can just as easily be handled by the player saying, "Okay, I climb the damn fence already."  I don't see a reason why the roll is necessary when players can just add it into the fiction themselves.  Why do they need the clatter of dice as a rubber stamp?<br/><br/>I don't know if CR is death to immersion, but I really can't speak to that as I pretty fundamentally don't understand immersion.  On the other hand, handing over that absolute trust to interpret TR into CR results to one guy sounds like it could be as destructive to immersion as stepping out to consider what you want to accomplish.<br/><br/>Mark, I'll hit yours when I get back from my stack of morning meetings. =P                        </div>

                            Elliot, <br/><br/>I find your proposition interesting, especially when I look at my own statements above. In most games I play these days I and my group are specifically making up story and doing narrative things. We rarely play mission completion or world immersion games anymore. <br/><br/>However, I have recently played a short-run campaign (4 episodes) of Spycraft 2.0, which is certainly an adventure/mission-completion game in which there are pretty detailed procedures for task resoultion and the steps of the mission. In that game task resolution worked well, because of both the mechanical boundings of the Spycraft system (which takes care of little bugaboos like "what happens when you fail a jump roll -- do you fall, get to roll again, get to roll to catch a ledge, whatever the GM wants?") and the focus on the players trying to overcome the difficulty of the adventure in mirror of the characters trying to overcome the difficulty of the mission.<br/><br/>However, I think it also fits with Ben's point that many of the systems of Spycraft -- like the Chase, Seduction, and Hacking systems -- all can be framed up as conflict resolution with subtasks chosen from a limited list. So even a big gamist adventure game like Spycraft seems to feature some element of both.                        </div>

<b>Joshua: This is your thread, so tell me to shut up if this is gonna derail things.</b><br/>
<br/>
The term "Conflict Resolution" is being used in all kinds of wacky ways here. Forget it. It's always been a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, let's say "Stakes Resolution." Much easier to define and understand, without getting all confused about stances, scale, scene, and other stuff that has nothing to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Stakes Resolution: Before we roll the dice, we come to agreement about what the outcome will mean for the fiction. In other words, "We set stakes, roll, and abide by the outcome." That's all there is to it.</b><br/>
<br/>
"My guy climbs the cliff."<br/>
"Okay, make a climbing roll with a +1 bonus from your rope and spikes. If you win, you get to the top without taking a fatigue level. If you lose, you take one fatigue level per failure level."<br/>
"Okay."<br/>
&lt;roll&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That's Stakes Resolution. So is this:<br/>
<br/>
"My guy climbs the cliff."<br/>
"Okay, make a climbing roll with a +1 bonus from your rope and spikes. If you win, you make it 20 feet farther up the cliff. If you fail, you fall all the way back to the bottom, and take damage."<br/>
"Okay."<br/>
&lt;roll&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Notice how SR has nothing to do with stance, scale, immersion, or specific mechanics.<br/>
<br/>
This is NOT Stakes Resolution:<br/>
<br/>
"My guy climbs the cliff."<br/>
"Okay, make a climbing roll with a +1 bonus from your rope and spikes."<br/>
&lt;roll&gt;<br/>
"Success!"<br/>
"You climb 20 feet and are blocked by an outcropping. Roll again at -1."<br/>
<br/>
Some people call the above thing "Task Resolution" which is also problematic. I prefer to simply say, "Not resolving stakes."<br/>
<br/>
So, to put my own spin on Joshua's question... <b>Is there any reason to NOT resolve stakes?</b><br/>
<br/>
So far, for me, the only good answer is Ben's: To provide color. Otherwise, I have to say no.                        </div>

<p>I don't think that some linear modifier is the correct answer here, John; the point is that Ethan suffers <em>orthogonal</em> consequences that are actually independent of whether he makes good arguments or not, while Julia's arguments are variable based on how well they work.</p>

                            John, <br/><br/>Certainly. You don't resolve stakes on that given roll because you haven't yet reached the result that you want. <br/><br/>This is most clearly seen in the GM position of illusionism -- if the GM wants you to climb the wall and you get a roll that indicates you don't climb the wall you will roll again, catching onto outcroppings or just starting again at the bottom, until you do. Same deal with jumping a pit the GM wants you to clear. You resolve the action when you're on the other side. Any failed rolls in the middle are defered because they don't get you to the point the GM wants you to get to. <br/><br/>In other groups it may not be the GM alone pushing it, and absolute success for the needs of the plot may not be the only reason why you must continue doing sub-tasks until you reach the desired goal. I've seen lots of things like "earning it" and "proper dramatic pacing" used in this category. Combined with the above it becomes a semi-principled decision on lumpley's diagram, and thus actually becomes part of the rules of the game. (Which is why I think many skillful players of trad games have problems with explicit stakes and conflict resolution systems -- they've developed massive skill in pacing and running conflicts on their own, and dislike having the mechanics intrude into their system.) <br/><br/>There can also be the fact that in some games the mechanics set the stakes for you. In D&amp;D if you make your climb check you climb 10' up. So no, you don't get to conflict set to climb the whole mountain with one roll. (Though notably, many groups do not make you roll 100 times to make it up the 1000' mountain, so....) This is because at that point D&amp;D is using a highly tactical and gamist movement system, and defining how far and fast you can climb can be vital to strategy. So in those situations the on-the-spot task resolution is important over stakes because of the way it fits into the tactical system of the game in total.                        </div>

                            Brand, I'm not talking about Illusionism on purpose. I know what it is, and how not setting stakes plays into that. But I think it's muddying this discussion in a big way.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the D&amp;D climbing rules are stakes resolution, clear as day. It doesn't matter where the stakes come from, only that we agree to them before we roll.                        </div>

                            Shreyas, <br><br>You're assuming a semi-narrative or at least ironically detached motivation in the players. That kind of thing usually doesn't work with realist task resolution. However, that kind of thing is also the province of specific kinds of players and games and is hardly a universal problem. <br/><br/>If'n you want your character to succede based on how well they perform in all situations (a commonly assumed default in many trad games and among the majority of players I've historically known) then you don't need to worry about situations like that.                        </br></br></div>

                            John, <br/><br/>Sure, with preset stakes of 10'. <br/><br/>And I don't think illusionism is muddying the waters. I think VAST tracts of what people assume about conflict/task resolution are not inherent parts of either but are our reactions to experiences of dysfunction based on illusionist play. <br/><br/>Seriously, I think a lot of people aren't talking nearly as much about task/conflict as they are talking about who gets to call what and where. The issue of force seems pretty central to me.                        </div>

<p>I'm not really sure that I am. These kinds of people exist in real life! They are, yes, extreme cases. But a non-broken TR system should handle them, and I don't know of one that does. At least, to satisfy my task-resolution needs. Which is what that whole aside was about.</p>

<br/>
I'm not, however, interested in drifting this thread into talking about Conflict Resolution or Stakes Resolution except to distinguish it from Task Resolution (which you did at the end of your comment).<br/>
<br/>
Brand, can you elaborate on the tactical crunch afforded by task resolutions that have built-in and non-negotiated stakes?                        </div>

                            Sure, Brand. People are talking about it. But that's not what this thread is about -- so far as I understand it. If we're gonna have another (remedial) thread about Illusionism and Force and such, maybe someone should start it. I thought this thread was here to answer this:<br/><code>I'm curious about Task Resolution all on its own. What's it good for? For Being There? Perhaps. What else?</code><br/>And I think a battle over terms and the relative merits of certain play styles is not much of an answer.                        </div>

                            John, <br/><br/>Briefly, my argument centers around the fact that I don't think we even have a consensus on where taks and conflict resolution are and where they are different. Ben seems to think that task resolution is always part of conflict resoultion at some level, and I tend to agree with him. Its just how open that stance is and who gets to determine it that makes us break them down into seperate entities. The how and where of the breakdown will, in my eyes, almost always have to do with openness and force. <br/><br/><br/>Joshua, <br/><br/>Fuck. I'm not the best gamist guy around here (where is Chris when you need him?), but I'll try.<br/><br/>If you're setting up a map-based tactical combat challange, something like you might expect to see in a good Iron Heroes adventure, then the whole of the conflict (we use violence until we die or they do) is going to be broken down in very solid and game specific terms. You don't want to have people negotiating outcomes on the fly any more than you want folks being able to change the number of train cards they draw in Ticket to Ride. If you can climb this amount in this span of time with this roll, whose odds of success you can calculate pretty easily, then everyone at the table knows what and how you can do long before you get to the specifics of the situation. <br/><br/>So if you're sitting there looking at the bolder up the cliff that you know you could push onto the dragon, and looking and seeing that the cliff is 30' tall and know that you can climb that in 2 rounds with 3 successful rolls, then you become able to start putting together a strategy of your own. If, otoh, you get to the cliff face to start climbing and then have to negotiate stakes of what happens (or what happens at the task level if you fail the 2nd of the 3 rolls, rather than having that be preset as well) then all of a sudden your whole plan could hinge on things other than the preset tactical elments that you'd wanted to use to plan your adventure. <br/><br/>In Spycraft you have a phase of the game where you purchase equipment. You know how much equipment you can buy, and exactly what it is going to do in the game in mechaincal terms. It's all laid out in the book. You also know the general level of your own skills, and the general level of the opposition you're going to be facing in the adventure. So at that point you are able to comb through this huge list of very specific modifiers in order to highlight where and when you're going to need help to get through the challange. At that point having the stakes and difficulties preloaded and very specific is neccisary in order to plan how you're going to be using your character resources before you even get into conflict.                        </div>

                            I have a terminology question - a real question, that is, in which I hope to find an answer, not a statement phrased as a question. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I think that we can all hit a fair amount of agreement on things that are definitely task resolution. And on things that are definitely confict resolution. The ends are clear. My own major interest in rules tinkering right now is the intermediate ground, like a single roll that would (I'm making this up as I go) encapsulate everything your character does for what would otherwise be several rounds of a fight. In White Wolf terms, maybe N turns where N is your dice pool for the kind of combat your'e engaging in. Or anything else where there's give and take in an overall process, but the process at hand is a subset of of the overall conflict.<br/><br/>I may not be making much sense. If so, I'll be glad to clarify. I'm just curious how people see the language and concepts of task and conflict converging, or maybe <i>not</i> converging but overlapping, and what you might point at as interesting examples of this so far.                        </div>

                            Thanks for the compliment, Brand. Yeah, that's what I was getting at with my <i>Panzerblitz</i> and gamist comments. In that regard I want to say something on this issue of illusionism in conjunction with GM discretion in setting stakes or even evaluating outcomes without preset stakes. Basically, my position is that with the proper orientation (which includes trusting the GM not to have a personal stake in particular outcomes), GM discretion doesn't have to be associated with Illusionism. The benefit of this approach is that it introduces the flexibility of human judgment and obviates the need for artificial constraints or abstraction. The drawback is that injecting supposedly objective judgment into the process opens it up to the perception and often the reality of bias. I think this is particularly so when there's a story-like agenda (either hidden or overt). I agree with Brand that a lot of the attitudes to task resolution are "reactions to experiences of dysfunction based on illusionist play", and I'd add that an important component of the dysfunction is adjudication gone wrong.<br/><br/>In some ways this issue of adjudication-with-task resolution is an echo of 19th-century arguments over rigid vs. free Kriegspiel, and while the arguments are interesting, I don't think they're universally resolvable. <br/><br/>Now back to Josh's interest in entailments.<br/><br/><i>Losing hit points, gaining traits, earning enmity, unforeseen consequences of your particular address, and the like. See this I can use, and I'd be interested to hear more about how TR can produce results in addition to whatever conflict they seem to be pursuing.</i><br/><br/>One way is in the way that markv discusses, which can be seen as task resolution breaking free of conflict resolution. The stakes may be set aside completely as a side effect of task resolution takes over the situation. E.g., the pilot fails his roll and the ship runs aground. Not only do the pirates escape, but the entire adventure has been transformed in a way that no one imagined.<br/><br/>Another way, which I think Josh would find more interesting, is task resolution altering the stakes of conflict resolution. Going from <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=19#249" rel="nofollow">an example Neel once gave from Dogs</a>: a raise could be such that the fictional consequences of taking the blow are unacceptable. Or more mundanely, the need to get the dice you need to see or raise may force you to decide between escalating (and, say, punching a woman for arguing with you) and deciding that winning the conflict just isn't worth it.                        </div>

<b>Markv</b> (which makes me think it's an engineering term like deltav) said stuff like this:<br/><code>The thingy could be the trapdoor by which you planned to sneak into the tower where the prince(ss) is held. Failure requires you to find another way which in some cases can be an enjoyable &amp; creative challenge.<br/>...<br/>The thingy could be a trapdoor you thought led into the tower's celler but actually opens to a shadowy tomb or enticing rabbit hole. Success tempts you to let the prince(ss) cool their heels for a while why you explore (and possibly abandon the prince(ss) story line entirely.)</code><br/><br/>With the exception of the slab on top of your comrade life-and-death situation (which, untied to conflict resolution, means the hauling off the rock means little-to-nothing to the other character's survival), these all seem to sound like entailments that Elliot has mentioned.  This is "other stuff" that can be added to, detract from, or derail the "current conflict."  I find this interesting.<br/><br/>I'm totally a control freak, so putting together some engaging conflict (either as player or GM) and then throwing in a monkey wrench like this, which may or may not completely change that conflict, seems maddeningly counterproductive.  On the other hand, I can see (if not sympathize) with a sort of sense of possibility and freedom that this sort of thing provides -- you can totally abandon the prince(ss) to explore this keen crypt!  Is that what people who are not control freaks like me might use this for?  If so... the control freak in me wonders why the crypt wasn't the engaging situation in the first place.                        </div>

<p>Josh:  Weighing in late, I'm afraid.  And by link, what's worse:  Here's an AP in which I <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18950.0" rel="nofollow">find TR loads of fun</a>.  I basically argue (in there) that TR is well suited for situations in which you want the freedom to try lots of actions, and have them each matter <em>somewhat</em> but none of them matter critically.</p>
<p>Like, for instance, D&amp;D combat.  You're unlikely to die in a single hit (unless you're fighting something gynormous) so you're free to dick around, take some risks, and watch your hitpoints either do okay or plummet.  <em>Eventually</em>, of course, all those hits are going to add up, and the difference between having done it right and having done it wrong is going to be critical.  But you've got a lot more margin for error, which means less pressure, which can mean more relaxed, frenetic fun.</p>
<p>I really don't have much in the way of complaints about TR systems that directly track consequences (again, D&amp;D hit points).  What I don't particularly like are TR systems where the summing of consequences happens entirely between the GM's ears.</p>
<p>If I lose 40 of my 50 hit points rescuing the princess from a lava trap then I can sit there and say "Wow!  That hurt!  I came close to snuffing it there!"  If I rescue the princess from an abusive argument with her father, and suddenly the king has my lands siezed and me banished then I don't have any sense of whether this is because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GM is a prick</li>
<li>Butting into the argument was legitimately a huge, huge source of social damage, or</li>
<li>I'd been riding the ragged edge of disaster for some time, and didn't know it until I dropped the straw on the camel's back.</li>
</ul>
<p>The less I know about the possible consequences of my actions, the less my actions are meaningful choices for me and the more they are flailing around in the dark.  TR <strong>can</strong> (theoretically) give me 100% feedback on exactly what the consequences of my actions will be, but very few systems (practically) do so.</p>

                            Hey, Tony.<br/><br/>I can see how TR can be fun <em>in the context of larger CR mechanics</em> such as you describe in the Misery Bubblegum link and in D&amp;D Combat (hit points track success of the conflict).  As lots of folks have pointed out in this thread, that works just fine, and is lots of fun.  Your point of marginal effectiveness of individual actions and signficant effectiveness of the sum of all actions is a good distillation of this.<br/><br/>But outside of transparent CR mechanics, I get the same results with tasks that you do.  Is the GM being a prick?  Did I do something "wrong"?  Have I been doing lots of stuff wrong but not been getting feedback on my actions thus far?  Whether it's illusionism or participationism or trailblazing or bass playing (thanks, Elliot, for slapping our hand on that one), when the GM adjudicates the results <em>and does so in a non-transparent fashion</em> the only thing we have to fall back on is our trust in the GM.  By which I'm not saying "I don't like to trust the GM" -- I'm saying "Why the hell don't I get a part of all that fun that's happening inside the GM's head?"                        </div>

<p>Bruce,</p>
<p>More details would help! But I feel like if there's give and take within a process, and that process doesn't resolve (in itself) a bigger conflict, then it's probably a kind of TR that's made up of smaller TR bits. Maybe we're talking about how coarsely defined the tasks are: one of the tasks is "do some damage in this round of combat", rather than the more exacting "swinging that sword". That's my guess, at least.</p>

                            Here's one example, Bruce: GURPS Martial Arts suggests that a bout between two martial artists actually consists of a lot of bouncing around, gauging each other's stance and position, and then going in for a few strikes -- only the 'up close' part is modelled with the combat rounds; the other bits are outside of the combat rules.                        </div>

<i>I think that we can all hit a fair amount of agreement on things that are definitely task resolution. And on things that are definitely confict resolution. The ends are clear.</i><br/><br/>Sorry, been too busy at work today, but I still haven't had a chance to weigh in on my thoughts that task and conflict are two ends of the same scale, just minor and macro, with a side level called "implication" which is set high on the micro side, low on the macro side, but really could be set either way for both for better effect.<br/><br/>I'll see if I can formulate something in the next day or two on it. Actually, the above is pretty much it save that it's missing examples.  But it'd derail this thread so I'll dump it in another.

<blockquote>Conflict resolution does not lend itself to translating the wishes of the player in an immersive Actor stance as well as task resolution. To resolve a situation with conflict resolution, the player first must step back, determine what he (the player, not the character) wants to occur, then roll, then translate back into immersive terms. The back and forth transition derails immersion.</blockquote>
I entirely disagree. I disagree because I have played immersive games with conflict resolution. Framing character <i>intent</i> is no less immersive than framing character <i>actions</i>, it's simply a matter of which you are declaring.                        </div>

                            Well, I disagree that "Framing character <i>intent</i> is no less immersive than framing character <i>actions</i>, it's simply a matter of which you are declaring."<br/><br/>Imagine a situation outside of gaming. You're talking with your girlfriend. You snap at her a little unfairly and she gets pissed. You don't even know why you did it. She asks you why you snapped at her, and you stop, step outside the moment, and ask yourself why. It takes a frame change of sorts.<br/><br/>When you're playing immersively, you're just doing stuff. Action only. You don't necessarily know why. <br/><br/>When you need to frame your intent, or your character's intent, you need to stop acting and figure out why. Often the why is "because that's how I feel, deep in my gut at an instinctive level, that my character would act this way."<br/><br/>Maybe this kind of character intent framing comes as easily to you as acting in character, but I know it does not come easily to others. Immersive players say this over and over. Having to stop to frame intent breaks immersion.                        </div>

Yeah, I'd strongly agree with this.  I think a great example is Vincent's old post on <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=9146.0" rel="nofollow"><b>Adventures in RGFA Simulationism</b></a>.  There he followed his instincts about what his character would do even though it literally seemed nonsensical -- and only later did he realize <i>why</i> he did it.  <br/><br/>One of the things is that in reality, people never do things for simple reasons.  Any answer to the question "why" is always a simplification of a more complex reality.                        </div>

                            Ben -- that's why I have, many times over in this very thread, repeated that I'm talking about TR without <em>explicit mechanics</em> for CR.<br/><br/>Jack -- Conflict Resolution isn't about character intent.  It's about player intent.  Which is one of the reasons why I half-buy the argument that Immersion and explicit CR don't jive together, since the Immersionist attempts to make player intent equate to character intent.  It seems to me that CR is designed for one thing (handling dramatically-defined Conflict) that Immersion is not incredibly interested in.  It's like saying, "Damn, that guitarist sure isn't making good use of the drumsticks."                        </div>

<i>See, talking about Task Resolution without Conflict Resolution is hard for me because I don't believe that you can play a role-playing game without conflict resolution</i><br/><br/>I agree that you're right, but perhaps the way to look at this is not "does my game have conflict resolution or task resolution" but "does my game focus on clearly defining and pushing conflicts, or does it focus on how you accomplish tasks, and only incidentally give you the support for formulating what the conflicts are?"<br/><br/>Games in the second category are filled with all sorts of tasks to accomplish, to the point that participants get distracted, and in the worst case, never actually resolve any conflicts (and thus it might even be said are not role playing).<br/><br/>Dogs is a good example of the former system. It beats into you that it's all about resolving conflicts, and it doesn't even give you tools to do task resolution outside the boundaries of a conflict, and in fact doesn't let you do task resolution at all, even inside the boundaries of a conflict.<br/><br/>D&amp;D on the other hand has this big list of skills. It also happens to have a pretty good system for resolving conflicts where the stakes are martial defeat (and best - death). But some participants get bogged down with looking for secret doors and bypassing locked doors, or worse, try to deal with conflicts on a social level, where the game gives no satisfactory mechanics for resolving such conflicts.<br/><br/>So, understanding task resolution and conflict resolution, I think it's fair to say Dogs is very strongly conflict focused. D&amp;D is strongly task focused, with a support layer for wrapping certain tasks into conflict resolution.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

                            You will recognize it as conflict resolution, I can guarantee it. This is another reason why I prefer "Stakes Resolution" as a term. PTA resolves stakes, just like Nine Worlds, Dogs, Sorcerer, Burning Wheel, yadda yadda yadda.<br/>
<br/>
How do you know when something is SR? Because you set stakes, agree to them, roll, and abide by the outcome. That's it. There's no fussing about stance or scale or where the stakes have to come from to be "legit".<br/>

PTA conflicts occur on the "narrative level" (I think -- man, what a confusing term!). And they still resolve the character's intent. Those things aren't mutually exclusive. That was kinda my point.<br/>
<br/>
See how this gets all tied up in knots for no good reason? It really is a lot simpler than we're making it. When you read PTA, you'll go "Oh. Duh. THIS is what John was talking about? This is <i>obvious</i>."<br/>
<br/>
Yep.                        </div>

<br>
Josh, if I may, I'd like to take this distinction and push it along a different axis.<br>
<br>
Consider two different, opposed schools of thought:<br>
<br>
There are those that say that game mechanics should handle the important stuff in a game, and that the players can simply "play-talk" (role-play, narrate, etc...) the unimportant stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Then, there are those that say that the important stuff in a game should be "role-played" (play-talked, in-character'ed, etc...), and that the unimportant stuff can be deferred to the mechanics.<br/>
<br/>
I'd say pure TR serves the latter crowd rather well. (Note that whether you or I would want to play that game or not is another question entirely.)<br/>
<br/>
Here's hoping to have made some sense...<br/>
<br/>

                            TR can take care of stuff you don't care about?

                            Hi, :)<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmyes, good point, but:<br/>
<br/>
Many people care Way Too Much(tm) about things that are Not Important(tm).<br/>
<br/>
Earlier in the thread, Ben pointed out that TR can be an awesome source of color. In a way, what he's saying is more or less aligned with what I'm saying, in that coloring the conflict is perhaps the smaller part of resolving it. (Ben, correct me if I'm misinterpreting you.) However, I can see those same diatribes be born of those same TR mechanics...<br/>
<br/>
You see, just because it's the unimportant stuff, that doesn't mean it doesn't matter. If it really didn't matter at all, then it could easily be arbitrated away. It's just that it's Less Important than the talkee stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Also, for many people (me included, sometimes), rules discussions are part of the game. In that optic, I'd rather discuss rules about the important-but-not-as-much stuff, than about the really-important-stuff. You see, the rules for the really-important-stuff have to be rock solid, or the actual Players At The Table are going to get hurt. (Note: for the purposes of this paragraph, consider "GM fiat" to be rock solid.)<br/>
<br/>
I guess the jist of this line of reasoning is: task resolution is good for the stuff that's too important to be arbitrated away but not important enough to warrant full-scale conflict resolution.<br/>
<br/>
Example: D&amp;D. Combat -&gt; very important -&gt; conflict resolution. Climbing and swimming -&gt; important but less so -&gt; task resolution. Buying equipment at the general store -&gt; even less important -&gt; arbitrated away.<br/>
<br/>
Corollary: some systems let the GM decide between important and not so important. (HeroQuest's simple and extended contests.) Some systems put that specifically in the hands of the players. (Shadow of Yesterday's Bringing Down The Pain.)<br/>
<br/>
Again, it makes perfect sense in my head. Whether I wrote it clearly or not, however...<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, some players get annoyed that they have to roll that stuff, and maybe D&amp;D isn't the game for them, but some players really enjoy that stuff.                        </div>

<blockquote>Conflict Resolution isn't about character intent. It's about player intent.</blockquote>
Conflict Resolution is about intent, it doesn't matter whether that intent is being assigned to a character or not. It doesn't make any difference whether it is being framed as "I (Jack) want to sneak into the castle to get the secret plans" or "Mifolico (my character) wants to sneak into the castle to get the secret plans" - the resolution works in the same way.                        </div>

<br/>
&gt; some players feel that knowing whether or not their character can climb and swim is important<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you're right. In fact, depending on the (circumstances in the) game, <i>I</i> am one of those players.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, in the past, I've been known to argue that the Rolemaster way is the right way to climb a cliff or cross a river, with detailed maneuvers. Because if you're going the detailed route for combat and if crossing the river is at all important in the frist place, then you should go the detailed route for crsossing it as well.<br/>
<br/>
What I was doing, before I had the tools to do it, is try to promote crossing the river and climbing the cliff into conflict resolution, because they were Really Damned Important.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; some players get annoyed that they have to roll that stuff<br/>
<br/>
They do, and again, depending on the (circumstances in the) game, I am one of those players. If it doesn't matter at all, why roll? The GM (if there is one) should just decide what works best or what makes more sense, and go with it, because it's Not Important At All.<br/>
<br/>
Thing is, there is a relatively high number of circumstances where what happens next falls somewhere between Really Damned Important and Not Important At All. And that's where Task Resolution comes in.<br/>
<br/>
--<br/>
<br/>
Additional point: Task Resolution is hard to nail as a mechanic, way harder than Conflict Resolution. And that means, often times, TR comes out broken. And because the stuff being resolved with it is Important, disputes ensue.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the game and the group, those disputes and rules discussions should simply be considered part of the game.<br/>
<br/>
This, of course, irks immersionists no end, and is, I believe, one of the sources of the role-player-vs-roll-player connundrum.<br/>
<br/>

Mostly I'm just curious at the proposition that Task Resolution and Conflict Resolution are terms that cover lots of discrete things within them, and we can scratch to find something interesting underneath.                        </br></br></div>

                            Maneuver Resolution. Yeah, that's pretty nifty.<br/>
<br/>
However! I don't think MR has a "pre-defined result". Because if you have agreed to the result before the roll... well, you're resolving stakes. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Remember, this is stakes resolution:<br/>
"If you roll a 25 or better, you hit and do 2d8 damage."<br/>
<br/>
So, maneuver resolution would be:<br/>
"Roll to hit. DC 25."<br/>
<br/>
"That would take a climbing roll. +2 for your rope."<br/>
<br/>
"Make a stealth roll."<br/>
<br/>
There's no agreement before the roll about what is being resolved (no stakes, in other words). It's just a roll "to see if you do it." The consequence of the action is not explicit and agreed-upon beforehand.                        </div>

                            John, I'm talking about something that pretty much splits TR into two things.<br/><br/>"Maneuver Resolution" is stuff like "Succeed at your Climbing Roll and ascend 10 feet."<br/><br/>"The Other Category" is stuff like "Roll Persuasion to sway the crowd... and the specific results of that success or failure will be up to GM discretion."  The roll is a source of authority, not credibility, if you want to get all technical about it.<br/><br/>Manuever Resolution is different from Stakes Resolution because (a) the "stakes" are pre-defined, and (b) the stakes have nothing to do with player intent and everything to do with character intent.                        </div>

                            This is my brain, going "click."<br/>
<br/>
That distinction (Manouver Res vs. Stakes Res) seems way more descriptive of what we talk about, and I wholeheartedly endorse it.<br/>

Seems to me that the interesting thing that happens with Man. Res, then, is the what happens after you roll. Like, you roll to see if you do it. You do it! Yay! Now, what kicks in to say what the "doing it" is? I would hazard to guess GM fiat is the traditional answer. What are some other ones?                        </div>

                            Heh...your post snuck in while I was typing, but my response should be read as directed at John. <br/><br/>Like, "Succeed at your Climbing roll and ascend 10 feet" - there's stakes there. If you win, you'll ascend 10 feet. If you fail, you won't. In my mind, that's stakes resolution.<br/><br/>"Make a climbing roll." - that's a manouver. If you win....then what? Something else has to kick in to decide.<br/><br/>I dunno. Something about this really clicked with me. I <a href="http://hamsterprophet.blogspot.com/2006/03/manouver-resolution.html" rel="nofollow">blogged about it</a>.                        </div>
