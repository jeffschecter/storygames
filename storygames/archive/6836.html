once is plenty. i don't care if it was a pre-gen character. that game kicked ass. check the other threads, you can read all about it.) <br/><br/>back to my review of D&amp;D4: i mean, it's a cool step up from previous D&amp;Ds, combat is better and non-combat seems better described too. my favorite section was in the DMG, it describes different motivations for players of the game (not for characters), like "actor", who wants to explore their character's personality, and "power gamer", who wants to use the rules to get the most effective character, and "watcher", who's there for the social scene.<br/><br/>and then there's a part talking about what's nice about and what's annoying about: one shot games, campaign games, one DM games, rotating DM games, playing with one group, playing with many groups. and i thought that was pretty useful for me where i am now, but would have been INSANELY useful for where i was a few years ago.<br/>so i look forward to more folks realizing their own play styles a bit more and having more of a language around that.<br/><br/>the player's guide couldn't hold my interest, the vast majority of it is the paths for the different classes as they advance, all the cool powerz they'll be getting. it's totally usefully laid out too, with a minimum of flipping pages as you make your character (not that i've made one...)<br/><br/><br/>when it comes down to it, i'd hazard that if you've liked previous D&amp;D games, you'll like this one more, because it's clearly written and in game play you have a lot of options and you get to the good stuff faster. and a first level wizard doesn't die after one hit.<br/><br/>if you've never played D&amp;D before or you've stopped playing trad-y games a while ago and wondering if you should get back into it, well i'd say jump into a game first. bringing a bag of chips along to meet a bunch of new potential friends is a hell of a lot cheaper than the set of "core books". <br/><br/>if someone you love is being held captive and the ransomers demand that you purchase D&amp;D 4e, you may as well go ahead and get it. worst case scenario they end up propping up a table that was SUPER wobbly. <br/><br/>the books, not the ransomers.<br/><br/><br/>hope that was helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152214/#Comment_152214" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T06:44:16+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  6:44AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, my take on it is like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  D&amp;D; 4e is still "Dungeons &amp; Dragons" for whatever value you assign to "Dungeons &amp; Dragons."  A lot of people have been busting on it, saying that it's all-combat, all the time, and there's no support for anything else, etc. etc.  This has pretty much been true for every iteration of the game.  The people saying such things are very silly.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  That said: you really do need mini's to play this thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Also, combat is a lot more fun and interesting than it's been before, because . . .<br/>\n3A.  Everyone can contribute meaningfully to the fight, even the (traditionally useless) first-level Wizard.<br/>\n3B.  Everyone can do a lot of crazy maneuvers and funky stuff<br/>\n3C.  The classes are designed to have synergy in combat: Cleric's maneuvers set up Fighter's maneuvers set up Rogue's maneuvers.  You're really a TEAM now.<br/>\n3D.  The monsters are really a team too.<br/>\n3E.  The monsters require less book-keeping than before.<br/>\n3F.  A lot of the crazy 3e complications--grappling, moving 1 or 2 squares on a diagonal, etc.--are now much simpler.<br/>\n3G.  There's some better rules on building an encounter so that terrain, traps, conditions, etc., matter more--the scene is more interactive<br/>\n<br/>\n4.  On the other hand, while fights require more intelligence and imagination than prior editions' Rock-em Sock-em Robots combat system, fights last a <i>long</i> time, which may not be your thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n5.  In previous editions, each class had a very different feel: if you were a 1st level Magic-User, you had to play the game very differently than a 1st level Fighter.  This difference is much less pronounced now.<br/>\n<br/>\n6.  I haven't seen it enough in play, but it seems like there's not much difference between low-level play and high-level play.  In earlier editions, high-level characters were dimension-hopping superheroes, stopping the flow of time, flying, using wishes, etc.; in the old BECMI basic sets you were running kingdoms.  This seems to be less an element of play now, but it's hard to say.<br/>\n<br/>\n7.  The DMG, for the first time in 30 years, is accessible and explains how to <i>run the game</i>, including how to build encounters.  For the types of people who really like having rules for Drowning &amp; Falling, it's a worthless book full of soft advice everyone knows; for people who appreciate soft advice, it's a gold mine.<br/>\n<br/>\n8.  Character creation is faster than in 3e, even at higher levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n9.  There are, as far as I can tell, no examples of play.<br/>\n<br/>\n10.  There is pretty much <i>no</i> effort to make the world of D&amp;D; plausible.  This is one of the things I personally really liked in 3e: there were these NPC classes, so you knew what regular people were up to; there were fancy rules for creating magic items, and something resembling a functional economy; the rules were sort of this freaky world-simulator--jumping off a 30' cliff into a 15' pool of water had a particular level of difficulty and did a particular amount of damage: the rules "pushed back" when you pushed on them.  This doesn't seem to be the case any more, and I miss it.<br/>\n<br/>\n11.  Certain parts of the game--skill challenges, rituals, magic item prices--have attracted a lot of criticism on mathematical grounds.  I haven't played the game enough to recognize whether these are real issues, but it sounds like these minor parts of the game did not receive sufficient feedback during playtesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LukeS." title="LukeS."><img alt="LukeS." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LukeS.">LukeS.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152235/#Comment_152235" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T09:23:32+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  9:23AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as the notion of objective review, I have two comments:<br><br>The first is that you ought to clarify what you mean by "objective."  Are you are looking for a review free of prejudice, a review written based exclusively on the reviewer's experience with playing and reading the game and not opinions about the game formed prior to said experience?  Or are you looking for a review which avoids any evaluative comments whatsoever?  Desiring the latter is unrealistic and misguided, for reviews are <i>supposed</i> to evaluate and pass judgement.  If you are looking only for a plain description of the game's mechanics, it is best to read the game itself.  It won't do to accuse a reviewer of a lack of objectivity merely because they praise a game.<br><br>My second point is that it is a good idea to read critically.

I made up my first DD4 character last night, and wound up having to do a crazy amount of page flipping, and *still* missed something important on the first pass.  The writing, in an attempt to be accessible, often presents things twice, first in a vague "it's generally like this" sort of way, and then later with actual mechanics.  Finding the specifics is often difficult, and in a few cases I still haven't been able to find them.  To top it off, there is NO sample character, which means you have nothing to check your intuitions about.  I had to poke around on the net, D&amp;D insider has nothing to offer, except a link in the forums there finally led me to a site where someone was posting "corrected" versions of the Shadowfell pregens, inspection of which finally led me to discover by aforementioned mistake.<br><br>I was really disappointed on this front.  I think the game that is DD4 is interesting, but the DD4 books as books are a bit of a disappointment to me.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>Mike, my take on it is like this:<br>9.  There are, as far as I can tell, no examples of play.<br/></br></blockquote>\nThere is one, taking up all of 1 column of text, on page 10 of the PHB.  Oh, and there is another brief example in the "how to run a skill challenge" chapter of the DMG. But overall yes, DD4 loses big on this.  As a player of complex wargames, I'm a big believer in the extended example of play as resource for checking your rules intuitions versus the designers intent.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa" title="Mike Montesa"><img alt="Mike Montesa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2395/2470886071_32bd4c6f2f.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike%20Montesa">Mike Montesa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152257/#Comment_152257" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T11:24:45+00:00" title="June 22, 2008 11:24AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 22, 2008 11:35AM by Mike Montesa.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            James, Jackson, thanks for the overviews!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: LukeS.</cite>As far as the notion of objective review, I have two comments:<br><br>The first is that you ought to clarify what you mean by "objective."

Of course I don't want a review that is free from opinion, but I do like to see opinions that are fair in their assessment - someone can say they liked or hated the game sure, but I do appreciated a sense of perspective and some support for those opinions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_152276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152276/#Comment_152276" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T15:39:56+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  3:39PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: James_Nostack</cite>The monsters require less book-keeping than before.</blockquote>Sry, not trying to start a rant here, but that one is ABSOLUTELY 100% LOVABLE!!! :-D                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152283/#Comment_152283" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T16:36:00+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  4:36PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well: monsters require far less book-keeping than 3e, I should say - and arguably less than 2e.

You have to read pretty much all of the book (or at least the chapters regarding your chosen race/class) to find out stuff, here and there. There is really no "character generation", per se. There are dozens of options, all scattered out throughout a 300 pages book. It's up to you (the player) to understand how to sum all that stuff up (and get it right).<br><br>And as I said, no examples with real hard numbers, so that those "not so clearly stated" rules can make sense to you.<br><br>In general, I'm finding I have been probably spoiled. Spoiled by light rules, spoiled by really well written and thought out books like the ones the indie community puts out. This (4E) is the first "trad" game I buy in... oh, many years, and I am not used anymore to that kind of stuff, I guess. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152291">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause" title="Clint Krause"><img alt="Clint Krause" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause">Clint Krause</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152291/#Comment_152291" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T17:42:58+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  5:42PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have time at the moment to write a full review or AP (I'd like to do one eventually) . . . but I just played 4E for the first time last night.<br><br>My take?<br><br>It's a really solid experience.  It's definitely a long-shot from previous editions of D&amp;D.  Almost all of the "mystique" that the previous editions (at least pre-3rd edition) have had is gone, but has been replaced with a really solid, tactically interesting game.  I noticed that the implied setting is also a lot more prevalent than in previous editions (which I thought was cool, but will probably drive some people nuts).  <br><br>We got through character generation, one combat, a skill challenge, and some role-playing all in our first 4 hour session.  I was really skeptical about all of the class powers going in, but they were actually really fun to play with (though, you really need to use extra resources like note cards and reference sheets to keep things from getting cludgy).<br><br>Oh, and the books (at least what I've read of them so far) are REALLY good.   I think it's the best edition yet for actually teaching the players and DM how to play the game.  The DM's Guide is particularly impressive.  <br><br>So, overall, it's a really solid, tactical fantasy game.  Much of the "game of the imagination" mystique is missing . . . but what remains is still fun and exciting in its own way.  I had a really good time with it, and I'm looking forward to playing again next week (we're running through an updated Keep on the Borderlands).                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/brehaut" title="brehaut"><img alt="brehaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://media.brehaut.net/"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/brehaut">brehaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152295/#Comment_152295" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T18:14:53+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  6:14PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A friend and myself dived into character creation on the weekend by starting to put together a hypothetical adventuring party. Our experiences echo others here. There is a general trend that characters are fairly quick to put together but there a lots of minor pitfalls and annoyances that add together to produce a somewhat threatening first shot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a list of things early on in the character creation chapter (no page ref sorry, at work). It has about 10 items and it exemplifies the big picture confusion of character creation well. Approximately, go to chapter 3 and pick a race, then to chapter 4 and pick a class. come back to this chapter and work out your attributes, now do skills for chapter 5 and feats from 6 and come back to 2. <br/>\n<br/>\nChapter two also explains a lot of the basic ideas of mechanics such as your saves and how they are calculated but omits exactly which attributes you use for each save (it will be one of two) presumably to show you how they are all the same. We found the specific calculations way at the back of the book in the in game rules section. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis sorts of big picture disorganisation is countered by really well focused small sections. Each race and class is well laid out. There is a box at the start of each that details the high level and character creation rules, and then steps into fluff and details. Learning how to make a particular class is really straight forward, the text guides you through each choice you need to make in order.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne simple feature of character creation I like (in particular for helping new players) is the nine questions about character personality. There are three sets of three questions that you answer with one adjective each. The range of words for each question is broad enough that you can sit down and easily knock out the big picture of a characters personality  but not so broad that it will overwhelm. I recall prior versions of D&amp;D having more explicitly open ended questions in a similar part of the process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152304/#Comment_152304" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T19:29:34+00:00" title="June 22, 2008  7:29PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>Lev Lafayette has written a series of reviews that attempt to examine the 1st ed AD&amp;D books objectively.</blockquote>\nI really wish you hadn't mentioned this.  Whenever I read reviews on rpg.net I always feel compelled to read the comments as well.  This generally isn't a problem as the reviews I read most commonly are those for indie games and sometimes WW supplements.  But damn!  Reading all the comments to these reviews is sucking up my entire night!  Oh well.
