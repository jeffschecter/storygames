                    Good day.<br/><br/>Now that I have some free time again, I think I'll try to complete some projects left on the backburner a few months ago: a couple of Wikipedia articles, finishing a translation of The Shadow of Yesterday, and, since my teenage sister in law asked, a translation of Panty Explosion.<br/><br/>Oh, and if I want to play The Roach with anyone besides my already-english-speaking gamer friends, I'll have to translate that too. But then, in MÃ©xico, we already have a song for <i>La Cucaracha</i>. :-)<br/><br/>In Spain there's a strong gaming culture. The gaming map is close to the one in the US meaning CoC, D&amp;D/d20, WoD and GURPS have a strong presence - in spanish, no less! - but there are some local jewels that get played a lot. There are quite a number of government backed <i>jornadas lÃºdicas</i> or gaming gatherings. They even have their own gaming super star in the person of Ricard IbÃ¡Ã±ez, author of <i>Aquelarre, El Juego de Rol DemonÃ­aco Medieval</i> (something like "Coven, the Medieval Demonic RPG") and <i>El Juego de Rol del CapitÃ¡n Alatriste</i> ("Captain Alatriste's RPG") among other works. Heck, they're exporting properties to the US now! (<i>Anima, Beyond Fantasy</i> coming soon from FFG.)<br/><br/>Which is all good, with just the slightest touch of envy. ;-)<br/><br/>I think gaming has had more of an uphill battle in Latin America - or MÃ©xico, at least.<br/><br/>In the old days (late 1980s), you had to be fluent enough in english because no local publisher ever printed D&amp;D - or any other mainstream rpg - because, i think, the rights were granted by language and someone in Spain already had them. So it never got a solid enough foothold before the ccg craze and the videogame wave of the mid-1990s. For instance, in MÃ©xico, only two local titles have been printed, each with a print run of 1K, a *very* limited distribution, and almost a 10-year span between both games.<br/><br/>Now you can order online, sure. But Spain has smaller print runs, which generally means a higher price. Plus the fact that crossing the Atlantic really add$ up. Just to illustrate, my last international order was 30 euros + another 30 euros for shipping, and it took four months to get here. And by "here" I mean the US.<br/><br/>So, if you want cheaper, you must know your english. You want <i>espaÃ±ol</i>? Well, you'll have to pay for that. Are those the only choices? No, there's also piracy.<br/><br/>You knew it, didn't you? But if that kind of problem exists in the US, it'll only be exacerbated south of the border.<br/><br/>Sometimes, when I communicate with on- and offline acquaintances who are involved in this kind of activity, I try to veer them off the path of evil (:-P) with phrases like "Man! Are you gonna print all of it? The book is cheaper and in full color!" or "Are you gonna read it all on the monitor? Well, good thing you're not buying the book - you'll need the money for a pair of eyeglasses". That blurb has worked, but only with english-reading people downloading english language books. And then I have to get on eBay to get them the stuff or give away a part of my collection. :-S<br/><br/>Curiously, they generally have the core books of their game of choice. Sometimes I think that the D&amp;D/WoD model is what's wrong. <i>How can someone be getting the full D&amp;D/WoD experience without all the books?</i> Of course it's not wrong, it's just a commercial model that it's working ok for them.<br/><br/>But, in general, I'm not recommending those games to newbies anymore. I like those games, I just don't like their model. I prefer pushing a <i>complete-game</i> rather than a <i>seemingly-never-ending line</i>.<br/><br/>A few days ago I gave a lecture/seminar about role playing games in a local anime convention. Just a five kids were there, in two groups. None of them read english. A group of two were into some kind of forum RP and had to leave early because their parents were there to pick them up - or maybe I just bore them to death! The larger group stayed until the bitter end so I gave them some Rifts books from my collection. They seemed happy enough with them and maybe that will get them to practice their english M4d 5k1llz. And, if they can understand that system, they will be able to understand almost anything else. :-D<br/><br/>But, if I get invited again to that convention, I'm hoping to get them acquainted with games like Panty Explosion, tSoY or Agon - complete and cheaper games. Maybe some demos.<br/><br/>Of course, I'll probably have to translate them.<br/><br/>Which brings me back to the original intent of this post, which was... I'm not sure anymore. :-(<br/><br/>The original intent probably was to tell you that, if you wanted to test the waters of spanish gaming, I could help you. I'm certainly not Cervantes but I think I can do an adequate job.<br/><br/>At one time - like a year ago - I asked Pinnacle if they wanted me to translate Savage Worlds, they seemed interested but didn't follow through. I translated two chapters and the main terminology but, since I didn't get the permission, I shelved everything.<br/><br/>In case you're interested - and in the spirit of disclosure - I'll probably be better off with smallish books, around 100 pages or less, since I'm *slow*. Really.<br/><br/>Well, sorry for the rantish nature of this post. If you have questions about anything I wrote, feel free to ask.<br/><br/>Now that I think of it, this whole rant is just my way of [badly] justifying my presence in this board since I'm not a designer nor a tester. I might as well translate.<br/><br/>Happy holidays.                </div>

I know companies like SJG license their product and another company localizes, prints, and distributes in their region, which makes a lot of sense - even if I had a nice translation of my games, getting them into the hands of, say, Spanish fans would be a challenge.  From my point of view, offering them through IPR is about as far as I could go, and even paying for the print run would be an expensive experiment.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Do you have a feeling certain titles would fare better than others in the Mexican/Spanish/whatever market?</blockquote>
Yes, but frankly I wouldn't know which ones. One of my *guesses* is that Lovecraftian-themed games would fare better. In general, I think Spain, due to his stronger gaming culture, might give almost all games a fair chance. For MÃ©xico, it would have to be cherry-picked I fear. And remember you'll be looking at a smaller number of sales.

I think the main transaction-killer between the new and old worlds are shipping costs. If IPR has an european fullfillment house *that prints in Europe*, that may help alleviate that. Otherwise I'd say go PDF. Hopefully, your game has paid for itself by now and you're just looking for extra-and-experimental revenue streams. Just trying to put your game in the hands of as many people as possible. Or maybe, if you game finds a fan over there, it might get printed.<br/><br/>To illustrate... yesterday I was reading the "December's Stuff to Watch" thread, read Jake Richmond's post and then I went to his blog. There was an entry over there about <a href="http://atarashigames.wordpress.com/2006/12/14/templo-de-hectate-talks-panty-explosion/" rel="nofollow">PE being discussed on a spaniard board</a> and I followed the link. Downthread, a couple of users that liked the game started talking about publishing it over there. One of them balked citing "that he already had mortgaged half his soul and sold the other half to a bank". :-)<br/><br/>But they were interested.                        </div>

I think that too. I was translating it from a site I found somewhere in the net, but isn't there anymore. Now I'm just waiting for my Paypal account to charge up and begin a mini buying spree; TSOY is one of the top games in my shopping list. When I get it, I'll finish the translation.                        </div>

Done. Let me know what you think!

I was just thinking of PTA (no kidding!) and how would some of the terms be translated. I'm still thinking about the name, though. I don't think there's a concept in spanish that exactly matches what "Prime Time" is. So we might as well not translate it too literally. :-)<br><br/>And you're using the term rightly, but I fear that describing PTA as a Telenovela's game might hurt it with the male demographic.
