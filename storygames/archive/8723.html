Still am, actually: It's a Call of Cthulhu that I can really feel immersed in. I simply have a hard time understanding/getting into what people did back in the 1930s, but it's much easier for me to make schoolteachers, police officers (or DG style: government agents) who encounter the mythos in modern times.<br/><br/>The earlier books were hit or miss for me: I think a lot of the information might be overkill ("Every government agency on the planet" list, frex), but the new takes on mythos were gorgeous (Hastaur, I'm lookin' at you). <br/><br/>Delta Green: Eyes Only is the newest supplement, actually a collection of a bunch of mini-supplements from a long while ago. It comes at a hefty price ($40), and the material looks pretty split between "new takes on mythos" and "real world information filler". <br/><br/>Has anyone read it, who can maybe say a few things about it?<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192947/#Comment_192947" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-17T12:35:26+00:00" title="February 17, 2009 12:35PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2009 12:36PM by DanielSolis.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking as the guy who laid it out, I found myself getting very distracted during the layout process because I kept slowing down to read the articles on the Philadelphia Experiment and time travel loops. I've never played Delta Green nor been a big Cthulhu fan, but those two sections, roughly 2/5 of the book, really caught my attention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192958/#Comment_192958" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-17T12:57:06+00:00" title="February 17, 2009 12:57PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2009 12:59PM by ccreitz.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is the second best supplement to a supplement to a role-playing game ever published, behind only <i>DG: Countdown</i>.  If you read the section on the Fate and don't immediately start foaming at the mouth to use the expanded material in a game or two, I'm afraid I will need you to turn in your Keeper license.<br/><br/>As you point out, <i>DG: EO</i> collects a few earlier supplements published as limited-edition chapbooks, each of which goes for $50 or so if you can even find one, and then hold off the rabid collectors of Lovecraftiana who would gladly kill you so they can bid on your books at the estate auction.  By this measure, <i>DG: EO</i> is quite the deal, as it will save you $110, plus having to deal with IRL cultists.<br/><br/>What's in there: three chapters are "new takes" stuff.  First up is "Machinations of the Mi-Go", a more detailed exploration of the "what the Mi-Go are doing" material from the original <i>DG</i>, which offers a lot of fun story seeds.  Next, there's an expanded look at the Fate, the coven-cult-crime syndicate also originally detailed in <i>DG</i>, which is positively oozing with the kind of color that made Tiger Transit (from <i>Countdown</i>) so much fun.  Finally, there is a chapter on the Philadelphia Experiment, recast in Mythos terms, which seems the weakest of the three but is not entirely without potential.  <br/><br/>After that, there is a neat chapter on tradecraft, which can add some welcome operational color to your missions, especially when you consider how you're going to convene the team and don't want to do yet another phone call from a disposable phone number, or you want to give the characters real-world-flavored options for communicating back up the chain of command.  Then, a few adventures, none of which I have run.  The first one, drawn from the Mi-Go material, is a bog standard CoC monster-of-the-week thing and doesn't seem like any fun.  The second is a straightforward projection of the situation in the chapter on the Fate, and could definitely provide a few sessions' worth of quality situation. The third, drawn from the Philadelphia Experiment background, seems like it could be enjoyable with the right group (one which sees knowing about the future as a fun narrative constraint rather than a boring powertrip thing), especially if you're running a traditionally high-fatality CoC game rather than a campaign \u2014 having the characters know that they're going to die, and precisely how, is a big part of the horror here.  If you have a narrativist-leaning group and want to toss them a little meat, "Artifact Zero" might actually be the precise scenario you're looking for.  Finally, there's also a section on New York City, your "real world info filler" stuff, which is pretty evocative.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd say the first two sections are worth the price of admission all by themselves, and you get some other stuff as a bonus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192966/#Comment_192966" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-17T13:48:20+00:00" title="February 17, 2009  1:48PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 17, 2009 1:48PM by ccreitz.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is interesting that Daniel thought that exactly the things I saw as weak in the book are its strengths!
