Making them as a PC, setting them up as a GM. Like, in Apocalypse World, you get an awesome toolset for this. The basic moves almost all have choices to make worked right into them, and the MC's moves are all about giving the PCs more choices to make ("Announce Future Badness" and "Announce Off-screen Badness" both prompt a reaction, and "Offer An Opportunity With Or Without A Cost" and "Tell Them The Possible Consequences And Ask" are both pretty much big choices on a silver platter). And Ghost/Echo's system is all about "Is avoiding this danger more important to you than succeeding at your goal?" And recently, thinking about this, I dusted off the old RPG-poem <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6545&amp;page=1#Comment_145988" rel="nofollow">"Hero Caves"</a> and gave it a whirl, and it was pretty fun, and all about choices at its heart, of course.<br/><br/>But, there's a reoccurring theme here: The GM sets up the choices, and the PC makes them. Sure, technically, the GM's got a choice of what sort of choices to set up for the PCs... and the PCs can always do unexpected things that force the GM to figure out how the NPCs would react to... but really, rarely are choices <i>set up</i> for the GM, by the system, if you get what I mean. So I'm wondering, what systems actually give the GM interesting choices to make, or ideas do you have for such a thing?<br/><br/>Polaris is kind of good: the Mistaken has the same negotiating tools as the Heart does in conflict. ("What should I ask for in exchange for what they just asked for?" "Do I want to go further?" "Do I want to give up the last thing I asked for in order to make sure what they just asked for doesn't happen?" Etc.)<br/><br/>Random tables, especially for situation generating, are another good idea: it's a constraint on the GM, how do they incorporate this new, specific thing, into the situation in way that both makes sense in the context and keeps things interesting? <br/><br/>Games where the GMs have limited resources, also. Including, potentially, 'encounter budgets'. ("Okay, I've got 5000 XP worth of bad to throw at the PCs. What do I want to use? Hmmm.") And, of course, games with well-implemented tactical combat, because good tactics is pretty much all about making the right choices in combat when the right choice isn't obvious.<br/><br/>So what else is there? What else could there be?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268779/#Comment_268779" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-24T11:26:56+00:00" title="April 24, 2010 11:26AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2010 11:35AM by Teataine.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Apocalypse World is really obvious here, not just with the GM Moves, but also the choices the GM is presented with after a player makes a roll. If the Gunlugger rolls 10+ on his aggro, do I make Dremmer cave in or force his hand?<br/><br/>As I'm moving from the alpha draft to the beta playtest of the game I'm writing, I'm considering putting in something like a prescribed list of conflict "win" conditions for the players, that are offered to the GM. So, the book would have a list of "if they win the conflict they get X". The GM would then have to chose these results and create conflicts for them. I don't know if that counts...<br/><br/>What else is there...could we say that games that let player make up their own flags (Keys, Beliefs etc.) are a sort of method to present the GM with options?

Just like what we (often) assume the players want for their PCs? Or just give them the tools to pursue their desires, and let them fill in those desires as they see fit?<br/><br/>But even more so than just "constrained choices", I mean, look at "Offer An Opportunity With Or Without A Cost" and "Tell Them The Possible Consequences And Ask" as examples. How often does the GM <i>get</i> costly opportunities, or have to consider the consequences of their own choices, instead of being the dude (or lady) <i>handing out</i> costly opportunities or informing others of the possible consequences of actions?

Every GM can make a GMPC and have them go along with the rest of the group. Heck, you can put the spotlight on them all the time and make their decisions the only interesting ones in the game if you want! Plenty have!  On the other hand, I don't normally associate having a character at the dramatic focus of the game with "GMing" as such. If the game is more egalitarian, it's less like being a GM in a privileged position and more like everyone has similar positions in the system.  For example, the Producer in PTA doesn't have a character with Issues and is never, EVER in the spotlight, EVER.  If you did a PTA hack where the Producer had a character with Issues and was sometimes in the spotlight, or the Producer position rotated, or there was no Producer and those duties were divided in some other way, that's fine, but that is less, not more, Producer-like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268830/#Comment_268830" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-25T00:54:56+00:00" title="April 25, 2010 12:54AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2010 1:14AM by wburdick.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Benhimself</cite><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I'm a little befuddled by this...the role of the GM "normally" is one in which they are putting opportunities for dramatically interesting choices in the hands of the players via the instrument of their characters (though often not exclusively).

Does sound like the kind of system you're talking about?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268845/#Comment_268845" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-25T08:43:04+00:00" title="April 25, 2010  8:43AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2010 8:44AM by Cedric P.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting, I think this address some of my questionings as a GM during my recent Solar System sessions. <br/><br/>Since my first story games, I am questioning myself on what I really enjoy as a GM. <br/>Maybe I want to feel like I am also playing the game.
