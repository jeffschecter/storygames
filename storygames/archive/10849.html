Living in a small town truly is, "Every body knows everyone else's business."  Most people in town conduct business locally and so you consider that everyone goes to one bank, one grocery store (Or convenience store), one local video store which might be located in the convenience store, one gas station, one repair shop, one barber/beautician.  You get the idea.  Some small towns don't even have some of these and have to go to the closest small town to get what they need.  A relationship map of a small town has lots of lines.<br/><br/>You are used to driving to get to bigger places.  There are more than your fair share of hunters.  Guns are commonplace.  If the town in incorporated, then it will have a police station with one or two local cops.  Also a volunteer fire department.  There can be two schools, one fore elementary and a few grades and a second for all the others.  A graduating class from the high school might have 20 to 30 people in it, which makes keeping up with people easy enough.<br/><br/>Also people move out of the small towns to get a job and make a living, and then move back sometimes to raise a family or to retire.  Houses/Land are very inexpensive.  This is a mixture of opinions based on 11 years of marriage and visiting the in-laws for an extended stay every Christmas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240552/#Comment_240552" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-05T04:58:03+00:00" title="November  5, 2009  4:58AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I grew up in Pittsburgh, but whenever I go to WV--especially the areas closer to VA--I notice a definite Southern twang in the language.

My family on my father's side is from an even smaller town.</blockquote>\n<br/>BTW, I too married a coal miner's daughter, but she was from Waynesburg, PA. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240612/#Comment_240612" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-05T11:15:41+00:00" title="November  5, 2009 11:15AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite>I live on the WV/Ohio border near Parkersburg, WV.

Small town of Gassaway (just a mile or two from Sutton the geographical center of the state).  You can SEE alot of the style on Wikipedia.  I know my hometown is shown on Wikipedia.  My friends and I had a "small town off"  a few weeks ago...  I won with Gassaway being smallest at around 900 people.  <br/>As for info that I could think of for you:<br/><br/>(see next post)<br/><br/><br/>My hometown is a little more "overgrown" with strip malls and such now...  but it's a perfect example of a little town like you're talking about in WV.  While great "period" movies like October Sky are accurate to that time period - the state is definately NOT the type of place that gets crazy rural right off the  "interstate"  (that's familiar 4-lane highway short-term)...  But then you go 5-10 miles off into flat-top roads FROM places like my home town and you'll hit dirt/gravel roads that DO take you into the creeps "Deliverance" type areas...  But any "town" will 90% likely be built up like my hometown.  Still TINY in relative terms but with all the conveniences of many modern cities.<br/><br/>Hope that helps...<br/>memory lane is fun<br/><br/><br/><br/>ooo... good joke on my home state!  My girlfriend teased me with it when I met her...<br/><br/>"How do you know people in West Virginia invented toothpaste?...

Some folks can still hear my accent now and then when I lived in New England and now Seattle.  For an extreme example:  think of that comedian Jeff Foxworthy that always says "you might be a redneck..."  Words like "yal", "yonder", "ther'abouts", folks and such are the norm.<br/>-  in the town I was born/grew up in my dad still lives, I always describe anyplace in the state as - just small enough to know everyone's face but just large enough to not recall everyone's name.  My dad can't go out of the house without running into 5-10 people that have known him for decades.  It's definitely a place that everyone knows your business, UNLESS you want to keep something secret, then it's near impossible to learn.<br/>-  the rural areas are unbelievably beautiful, but can also get dry/ugly in the winter from various company landscape damage from clear-cutting to strip mining...  finding "trash" (like old milk jugs, stripped t-shirts, a kitchen sink, etc...)  in crazy deep woods areas surprised me as a young kid exploring the wilderness.... I mean when/how did that stuff GET there???<br/>-  the "city" areas will (nowadays) have all the luxuries of any US city, internet, cable, stores, etc... but anything 5-10 miles OUTSIDE of those towns/cities will not have "the cable" and such running to it.  My mom was constantly saying "we want cable TV and internet, but the Joneses down the road toward town won't pay for the cable to run through their property"  she's even offered to PAY for it for them but they refuse...  <br/>-  strip malls are very very common now,  so you'll see stores like the Gap, Barnes &amp; Nobles, SuperWallMart, etc... but at the same time it will ALWAYS have a smalltown vibe, with the clerks/managers heavy accents as well as all sorts of "backwood" gear being sold side-by-side with the "normal" stuff  (rifles, shotguns, hunting gear, fishing gear, locally canned goods, etc...)  all on the shelf next to the big brands...<br/>-  everyone's incredibly nice/helpful with one another,  to the point of annoying if you're not used to it<br/>-  roads and public works seemed (to me) to ALWAYS be under construction, roads we always cracked and broken  OR  just brand new...<br/>-  however,  if you cross someone - you're in the doghouse, there's a wicked vengence streak that runs through people I've known.  Think Hatfield and McCoys.<br/>- the  Hatfield and McCoys feud is another big reference point...  West Virginia to Kentucky.<br/>-  it's said that the satalite dish is the WV state flower, especially from the 80s-90s with those BIG dishes.  Where any mid-level income family would buy up a dish to get their "cable TV" even in the sticks areas...<br/>-  the steriotype of old cars rusted and up on blocks in the front yard of your doublewide trailer... is NOT a stereotype in WV.  Then again there are also perfectly nice/normal homes, etc... BUT more than not you'll see the steriotype OR you'll see a strange bastardisation of the "American Norm" with a home overblown with stuff, packing a small plot of land with garish niceties from hottubs to 4-car garages to yard gnomes, etc....<br/>-  one HUGE thing that I get all the time is nearly everyone in the world mistakes WV with VA...  most people (SERIOUSLY) donot realize that WV is it's own state!  I'm always getting  "...You're from WV? So how close to Richmond are you?"  that's another F*&amp;^ing state you moron!<br/>-  my roomate in college  (Marshall University, Huntington, WV)  was from Georgia.  He honestly thought that WV was part of the "south" until his junior year in college!  It came out one night talking - he said how he was proud that WV was at least a "southern state"...  He didn't realize that WV split from VA DURING the Civil War!  So much so, that I had to get other people to confirm it to him...<br/>-  other good references:  Discovery Channel's "Hillbilly" documentary,  the movie "We Are...Marshall"<br/>-  to prove it's not all that bad/rural and you CAN blend in normal with the rest of the US - Jennifer Garner is from Charleston WV (extremely hot and obviously not a backward hillbilly... )<br/>-  it's defiantly a state of opposites... you'll see kids with iPods walk down the street (pretending to be gangster)  walking past a classic steriotype of a Hillbilly moonshiner old bearded dude sitting in a rocking chair on the stoop of a downtown sidewalk...<br/><br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/artexercise" title="artexercise"><img alt="artexercise" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://artexercise.mygamesonline.org/graphics/Dragon_Icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/artexercise">artexercise</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240628/#Comment_240628" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-05T14:27:57+00:00" title="November  5, 2009  2:27PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            small town contest...

One of the most striking things about WV isn't the min<i>ing</i>, but rather the <i>mines</i>. Doesn't matter if no one is still working them, they're there, they're enormous, there are a lot of them, and they're brutally ugly. If you live near one, or drive by one, it takes up a lot of space in your mind.<br/><br/>Joe's point about miners being mostly older is interesting too. It's pretty hard to fire a miner; unions are still major players, moreso than almost anywhere else in the US these days. That might be something you could touch on. Also, there's the <a href="http://www.msha.gov/" rel="nofollow">Mine Safety and Health Administration</a>, which doesn't seem to have fans on either side of the management/labor split. Do a blog search on it, paying special attention to epidemiology/public health blogs, and you'll see what I mean. Mines in West Virginia seem to get mentioned disproportionately often, probably because the margin on coal is so slim compared to the margin on e.g. copper.<br/><br/>The <a href="http://www2.wsls.com/sls/news/local/new_river_valley/article/appalachian_trail_killer_may_be_suspect_in_double_shooting/10572/" rel="nofollow">Appalachian Trail Killer</a> appears to be back in business. That's in Virginia rather than West Virginia, but might give you another story angle. Definitely hardcore backwoods and hollers. The AT is emblematic of WV's natural beauty, and might be something to keep in mind as part of what draws (usually peaceful and considerate) outsiders in. On that note, I know you said "no <i>Deliverance</i>" but seriously, whitewater brings outsiders, tourists, to the wildest parts of the country. West Virginia is famous for the New and Gauley rivers, both of which are lousy with tourists in the summer. I have run both those rivers, and I never personally saw it become a problem, but I can imagine a local teeing off on some drunk, testosterone-poisoned trust fund parasite.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241070/#Comment_241070" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-09T10:30:31+00:00" title="November  9, 2009 10:30AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: artexercise</cite>Coal is still an important industry and with some newer technologies coming along it may pick up again.

Legalized video lotter machines, which used to be called "gray machines" caused these places to spring up all over the state before local communities had a chance to pass ordinances to limit where they could be built.
