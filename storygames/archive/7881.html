They get fought over by men. They tend to giggle. They're often young and beautiful, except when they're big matrons or old nagging crones.<br/><br/>And, of course, in Historical Times they are always housebound and powerless. Because that's just how things were, realistically.<br/><br/>Here's a challenge: Write up an active female NPC, one who can and will take the initiative to do stuff, in fifty words or less.

From an early age Freka showed an intense interest in the Cathedral Guard, who were based near to Sigmund's workshop. Thoughts of weapons and armour were far more attractive to her than carpentry, no matter what her father tried to teach her. In the end Sigmund spoke to the Guard Captain, who agreed to take both children on as apprentices. Freka took to the training like she had been born for it, and though her brother was not nearly so keen she coached him in private to assure that both of them would make the grade and be appointed to the Guard proper, which they duly were around the age of 17. For the following two years they served faithfully, Freka with some distinction and Hodi, at least, with no great disgrace.<br/><br/>It was at this time that the pair came to the attention of the player characters, after they spent a week fruitlessly searching the Cathedral for a hidden chamber. Hodi and Freka were assigned to aid them, and Freka particularly caught the eye of the Knight Sir Ina (one of the PCs) who saw great potential in her. Sir Ina spoke to the Guard Captain, who agreed to allow Freka to enter the Knighthood of the Order of Atur as a novice. As usual Freka insisted that her brother go where she went, and Sir Ina agreed, a little reluctantly, to allow Hodi as a novice as well.<br/><br/>Over the following years Freka quickly grew into a knight on her own merits, serving at Sir Ina's side in a number of crucial actions, and attracting the praise and attention of senior figures in the Knighthood. Indeed it seemed that Freka's rising star could not be stopped, and she soon was rewarded with official membership in the Order, and special duties ... special duties that nearly proved her downfall.<br/><br/>Assigned to aid Sir Ina and her companions in their secret fight against the dark cults pervading the land Freka, alone and separated from her friends in a dark tomb, came across an enchanted spear, long forgotten and abandoned by man. When she took the spear in her hands she felt stronger than ever, sure, confidant, powerful. With the aid of this spear, which she named Judgement, she fought her way out of the tomb alone, and turned her wrath on Tanaloth's enemies. <br/><br/>At first her companions complemented her on her find of this enchanted weapon, surely a gift from the Gods, but slowly they began to notice a change in her demeanor. Once fun loving and carefree, Freka became somber and quiet. Once accepting and forgiving, now Freka began to echo the name of her spear and pass strict Judgement upon anyone she encountered. At first those she found unworthy attracted only her scorn, but soon they were attracting violent wrath instead! The more she held the cursed spear the more violent and unforgiving she became. When this wrath was directed at the enemies of the Church no one cared so much, but soon she turned on those within the city, even her own friends, who she believed had failed her! <br/><br/>What could her friends do? They would not abbandon her, they dared not report her, and yet with Judgement in her hands they could not stop her either, for the spear enhanced her natural prowess till she was more than the equal of any of them. In the end they appealed to the only thing that remained of the Freka they knew, the dedication, the discipline, the desire to excel and perfect that had driven her since she was a little child, watching the Cathedral Guard drill near her father's house. If she could not be persuaded to put aside the spear she must instead master it, before it stole everything that she had worked for. It was a hard task, in a hard time, for there was rebellion and civil war in Tanaloth, cold winters and bitter summers and battle on every side. The spear struggled but Freka struggled too, not alone, but with the aid of her friends, who stood by her where they could have abandoned her.<br/><br/>The end of the civil war, only a few months ago, saw a different Freka born. No longer the happy child obsessed with glory, and no longer the grim Judge obsessed with failure. No longer a child, or a novice or a squire, but a woman, a warrior and a Knight. She still carries the spear Judgement, but it serves her now and not the other way around, and she knows how to smile as well as fight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174707/#Comment_174707" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-13T03:12:51+00:00" title="October 13, 2008  3:12AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nope, never had one of those.

One was a short, stubby, brooding, angry little kid whose dad had died; he lived with his mom, an alcoholic. The editor suggested we change his gender - but we made sure to make her exactly like he'd been. That was a girl character with some depth.<br/><br/>In "De Sultne", players write down different traits for characters, then draw traits including gender from a hat. That way, both female and male characters get to be ambitious, flirtatious, greedy, vengeful, violent etc. (In play, though, the female characters often end up bearing satan's spawn - I don't know why; there's nothing in the rules that makes this likely, but it seems to be an emergent property of the setting and the players' ideas about stories about women).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175265/#Comment_175265" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-17T02:21:19+00:00" title="October 17, 2008  2:21AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lady In Mourning: A middle aged woman in bits and pieces of appropriated armor and a white deathmask.

Based on my boss in the Air Force, she's a half elf Fighter who is highly respected by her men and the prince who employs her.  She's a sniper with a bow and takes no crap.  In the story the players meet her as the goblinoids lay siege to the city.  Later she is romantically linked to the prince who is obliged to marry a noble.<br/>\n<br/>\nDelenda Movander - The baroness (or some such rank) seeks the hand of the prince.  She is currently the vessel to a lich like being passed down the family line for about a thousand years.  If she marries the prince, the lich will be born as his son. Delenda has Ilsabet kidnapped by the goblin horde (who are acting under her command).<br/>\n<br/>\nPrincess Ilanya - Half sister of the prince, she is a druid of considerable ability.  She is also mastermind of a elf "breeding program" where males are encouraged to take human mates.  The half-elf children will be brought back to the elven tribes in the hopes of borrowing human fertility.  For this, and her efforts to keep her domain 'green', the elves regard her as the 'green lady'.  Later the characters will find that the 'green lady' is calling the shots for the elves on the whole island.<br/>\n<br/>\nElaine - Once a famous adventurer, she committed suicide when her husband fell fighting a lich.  As the poisonous ashes stole the life from her body, Uriel the angel of Retribution offered her immortality.  She is driven by the desire to avenge her husband and the punishment of evil.  As a Penitent, she has all the time she needs to destroy the Marauder.  Finding him will be another matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only female NPCs i have that are housebound are those that are in the background.  The rest are movers and shakers.  It's been a long time since i ran my VtM game, but the female NPCs were also quite powerful and dynamic in their own right.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are trying to have a period game, having house bound women makes sense.  Well behaved people (male or female) seldom make history. Drama is the fallout of people making bad decisions.  It might stretch suspension of disbelief if women aren't "in their place".<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a fantasy setting, where women can swing swords and spells with the best of them, it's not hard to imagine that there would be more even treatment.  There's also the option of matriarchal cultures or cultures with three genders or perhaps just one.  That would be wild.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaizo had a contest where people could submit parts of a campaign and the winner would receive a commission to write a module.  My favorite villain was a barren nanny who kidnapped children.  She could be something like a hag, but i preferred her as a normal person who went a little bit nuts.  Imagine the PCs bursting into her hideout and her falling from a single blow.  Big powerful adventurers killing a woman almost without trying.  She could either be killing the children or simply hording them somewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
