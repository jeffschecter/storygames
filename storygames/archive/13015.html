He needs to win this tournament.<br/><br/>Jimmy James:  Is a tractor-pull n00b - he wants to enter the contest, but doesn't even have his own tractor.  His dad, Mr. James, is a cop.<br/><br/>Kyle James:  Jimmy's younger brother, who worships Jimmy but also tends to get himself in trouble.  He's coming along even though he's legally not supposed to leave the state, and he assures Jimmy they'll be able to lease a tractor once they get to Flagstaff.<br/><br/>Clair O'Hair:  The Potato Queen of North Dakota - she's going to be presenting the awards at the tractor pull.  She went to school with Billy Bob and is friends with Jimmy James.  <br/><br/>The Vehicle:  Clair's uncle owns a flatbed truck, which is what they'll be using to get to Flagstaff, once they've loaded Billy Bob's tractor on it.<br/><br/>Real needs:  <br/>Billy Bob Gunderson:  Meet a nice woman and settle down.<br/>Jimmy James:  Isn't cut out for tractor-pulling.  He really ought to be a cop like his father.<br/>Kyle James:  Needs to get out of Jimmy's shadow and get the hell out of North Dakota, live somewhere else.<br/>Clair O'Hair:  Is in love with Billy Bob.  (Her high school crush?)<br/><br/>Kickoff Scene:  Loading up the truck, Kyle helping, while their dad looks on from the porch.  Kyle keeps forgetting to say "you" instead of "we" about the trip, but their dad somehow doesn't get suspicious.  They drive off in the truck - Kyle waits for a bit and follows in their dad's chevy.<br/><br/>Situation 1) (Billy Bob's) The Waffle House in Fargo - they're eating and the waitress - Flo - recognizes Billy Bob from school.  Jimmy James says insensitive things about Flo's age, even though she's only a couple of years older than Billy Bob.  When Flo hears they're all going to a tractor pull, she's so excited, and asks if she can come along.  Billy Bob tries to talk her out of it, but Jimmy and Clair are pretty excited.  "Yeah, come on!"  <br/>(Clair's player doesn't know yet Clair is in love with Billy Bob...hard to imagine even the most subconsciously-in-love character egging their beloved on like that.)  Kyle shows up as they're finishing breakfast - "You ate without me?  This girl's coming?  What?"<br/><br/>Situation 2) (Clair's) At a rest stop near Sioux Falls, Kyle has to go to the bathroom.  So Clair goes to, and on her way out, there's a strange guy who talks to her.  <br/>"Oh god, you're not talking to me?" she says.  <br/>He recognizes she's the Potato Queen of North Dakota and starts pestering her for an autograph.  Jimmy comes in and protects Clair - he punches the creepy guy and then the creepy guy throws himself on Jimmy, and they tussle.  Clair takes what she thinks is mace out of her purse - but it's really perfume.  (Good result:  drive the guy off, price:  Jimmy is blinded by the perfume, price: guy decides <br/>to start stalking them:  3-3-2.)  The guy backs off but watches them from a distance - and Jimmy has an allergic reaction to the perfume.  His face swells up - he's not going to be able to drive the next shift.<br/><br/>Situation 3) (Kyle's) Billy Bob drives for a while and it's time for someone else to take a shift.  Clair refuses to drive because she's a beauty queen, she doesn't drive - (we forgot for a while that Flo was in the truck...guess she was asleep in the back.)  which means it has to be Kyle, even though he's under house arrest in North Dakota and doesn't know how to drive a truck.  After some arguing, Kyle takes the wheel.  (6-5-5:  he aces it.)<br/><br/>Situation 4) (Jimmy James's) Jimmy looks out the right side view mirror - one of his eyes is starting to clear up now - and he sees that that same creepy guy from the rest stop is following them in a Firebird.  "Hey, that guy's following us.  Pull over." <br/>Kyle: "We can't afford any more delays, Jimmy!" <br/>Clair: "You're not going to get in a thing with him, are you?"  <br/>"No - no, I just gotta take a leak."  <br/>So they pull over, and Jimmy grabs a tire iron and walks out into the road.  The creepy guy stops well away with them.<br/>Jimmy:  "Come on.  Bring it."<br/>The creepy guy guns the engine and starts driving straight at Jimmy.  (If it had gone to the dice here, Jimmy would have rolled to win the game of chicken, but - ) <br/>Clair gets out of the car, "Don't do this, Jimmy!"  <br/>And seeing Clair in the way, the creepy guy swerves and crashes into the guard rail and knocks himself out.  <br/>"Let's go," Jimmy says.<br/>Billy bob:  \u201cWe can't just leave him here.\u201d<br/>After some arguing, Jimmy pushes the creepy guy into the passenger seat and gets into the driver seat of the Firebird.  <br/>"What are you doing, Jimmy?  You're acting like dad," Kyle says.  (Trying to drop a hint about Jimmy's real need.)<br/>Jimmy tries to drive the car to the next rest stop (we give him 4 dice because he's being responsible like a cop might...but he gets 4-3-3-3.  Prices: creepy guy wakes up, cop shows up) he gets to the rest stop and then crashes - (took us a while to work out, with a few small rewinds, how this leads into the next situation) - Billy Bob's been following so he gets out of the truck to help Jimmy out of the wreck, and that's when a cop shows up.<br/><br/>Situation 5) (Billy Bob's)  (Clair's player played the cop excellently -) "hands on the hood, license and registration, care to explain to me what's going on here?"  <br/>Jimmy is delirious - he calls the cop "dad".  "Back off dad.  Give it a rest."  <br/>This makes the cop angrier, of course.  <br/>The creepy guy starts whining, "They stole my car!  They were kidnapping me!" <br/>(Since this is Billy Bob's scene, I bring in Flo.)  She gets out of the truck, starts telling the cop it's not Billy Bob's fault, the cop tells her to get back in the truck but she doesn't, and then she touches the cop - so the cop takes her down, cuffs her, and puts her in the back of his patrol car.  (This was NPC-vs-NPC scene - played by me and Claire's player, and it turned out just as I hoped it would.)<br/>At this point Billy Bob starts talking to the cop, trying to talk him down.  (Dice: give him 4 because he might convince the cop to let Flo go.  Win is we're free to go, losses are Jimmy goes to jail &amp; Flo goes to jail.  He wins but has to pay one price - he lets Flo go to jail.  Ha!) <br/><br/>Situation 6) (Clair's) The characters argue for a while about whether Jimmy James needs medical attention - now he's calling Billy Bob 'dad' and Claire 'mom' - they're arguing, and he says something along the lines of "I know you guys really love each other even though you fight.  They're in love, Kyle."  That cinches it - he needs medical attention - and we decide to find a clinic, but we're in the middle of nowhere.  (At first we thought, let's just find the clinic - but then we couldn't think of anything to have Clair roll dice for - so we decided to make it difficult.  Good result:  Jimmy <br/>gets better;  Prices:  had to go to a vet, and to talk them into it Clair had to show her beauty queen talent)  After doing her hula hoop tricks for the vet, the vet gives Jimmy some animal tranquilizers and one of those cones to keep him from scratching himself.<br/><br/>Situation 7) (Kyle's) We're in Colorado by this point, (Kyle:  "Don't you feel bad about leaving Flo in jail back there?"  Billy Bob:  "Flo and I got history."  Jimmy:  "Billy Bob, did you hit that?") and they decide to spend the night at a motel, and the other characters start hinting madly what Kyle's Real Need is.  <br/>Claire: "Isn't it beautiful here?" <br/>Jimmy:  "Wow, Kyle, this is  the farthest away from home you've ever been.  Why don't you go have fun tonight?"  <br/>Kyle:  "You'll come with me, right, Jimmy?"  <br/>Claire:  "Don't tell him that."  <br/>Jimmy:  "Yeah, you ought to go with him."  <br/>Kyle:  "Let's go to a strip bar."  <br/>Claire:  "No!  I'm not that kind of girl.  Let's go get chili cheese fries, there's this great place."  <br/>Jimmy stays back at the motel, and after some more roleplaying, where Kyle talks about how Jimmy isn't so bad, you should have seen what dad is like.  <br/>Clair:  "Your dad sounds like Jimmy."  <br/>Kyle:  "Jimmy got dad's good parts.  I like to think."  <br/>Some streetwalkers come into the place-some transvestites-and Kyle notes that they don't make them like that in ND.  <br/>Jimmy's player guesses his Real Need:  To get the hell away from North Dakota.  So he does his epiphany.<br/>"Yeah, it is beautiful here.  I really haven't seen much of the world.  You know what guys?  I'll keep going with you to Flagstaff, but after that, you can go home without me.  I don't know where I'm going to go, but I know it's not there."<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>And that's as far as we got.  Jimmy's player asked if his need was to be a cop like his father and we said yes, and Billy Bob and Claire had no idea.  This seems like a pretty good rate for epiphanies.  Hopefully in Billy Bob and Claire's third situations we would have dropped stronger hints and they would have gotten it.<br/><br/>It was all fun, good times, a lot of joking and funny dialog.  Wish I remembered more of the quotable lines.  <br/><br/>What didn't work was when we tried to hint to other players what their needs were without actually coming right out and saying it.  Right now, the only way to do it is to try to awkwardly work it into conversation.  Almost but not quite as bad as, "So, Kyle, you'd probably like to get the hell out of North Dakota, huh?"<br/><br/>I was hoping that when players had their characters do stuff that was pretty out of character considering their Real Needs (like Claire encouraging Flo to come along on the road trip) that we could rationalize it away pretty easily, but it didn't seem to work.  I think maybe the other players ought to be able to tell you how you're feeling as another hinting mechanism.  For example, for Claire's case, when Flo wants to come along, we could have said, "You start feeling angry about this."<br/><br/>Some of the dicing was murky - I was using otherkind dice more or less straight up, and the difference between achieving a goal and making progress was hard to judge.  I think for this game it's fine for 3-6 to be "you succeed" - 66% is kind of a sweet spot for success, IMO, anyway - the important thing is for the dice to introduce complications.<br/><br/>The game's longer than I would like, but c'est la vie.  It took us about 45 minutes just to create the characters and situation, but the process was fun, so I'm ok with that - in fact, I think it needs to be longer.  When you talk about someone's Real Need, you should also talk about the situations you're going to set up for them, and the hints you're going to drop.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293461/#Comment_293461" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-15T08:13:11+00:00" title="September 15, 2010  8:13AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Funny that seeing the transvestite hooker is what made Kyle had his epiphany.<br/><br/>I think you hit on something when you said the other players should hint at how you're feeling about what you're doing. Like the players can toss you white or black tokens in the middle of play to indicate whether your character is feeling in tune with their inner desire. And then that affects the roll in some way. Like white tokens give you extra dice to roll, black tokens are a -1 to some die you use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293483/#Comment_293483" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-15T09:56:50+00:00" title="September 15, 2010  9:56AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, I like that.
