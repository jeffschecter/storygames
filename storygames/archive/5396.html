We started off the night tired and dragged out.  Nevertheless, we managed to wrap up an incredible game with an incredibly powerful session.  (The previous ones:  <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=25488.0" rel="nofollow">Session One</a>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=25538.0" rel="nofollow">Session Two</a>)<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Session Three:  Disaster</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Chapter 7:  Old Town Must Hold</i><br/>\n<br/>\nMission Leader:  Seth<br/>\n<br/>\nSituation Elements:<br/>\nRalph:  A badly injured German soldier, Gefreiter Horst Kuhn, is hiding in a ditch<br/>\nSeth:  We\u2019re about to be killed, we cannot wait any longer<br/>\nCrystal:  A tearful farewell<br/>\nKeith:  A coward shows his true colors<br/>\n<br/>\nMission:  smuggle elderly civilians, including Ola\u2019s mom, out of Warsaw.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe needed to get the civilians through German lines to the partisans in the woods outside.  The crew didn\u2019t know that Leon had sold them out.  So he was on point for this mission.  He went on ahead until he was challenged by German sentries.  He used the passphrase that he had been given to identify himself.  Keith contributed a d6 to the mission pool.  Then he lied to the Germans, telling them that the breakout would happen somewhere else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019ll admit that I was on edge for this.  I was <i>sure</i> that Leon was going to sell us out.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, the rest of the crew was getting the civilians moving.  But they were elderly and couldn\u2019t keep up the pace.  So Gigant had to carry them to the edge of town.  I grumbled at Ralph for doing this to me and then donated a d4 to the mission pool.  So Gigant lugged the civilians, one at a time, across an open plaza, getting them to safety.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>It\u2019s the previous winter.  Gigant is tossing pebbles at Honoratka\u2019s window at her house in Warsaw, trying to get her attention.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  Impress Honoratka.)  I rolled a d8 and failed.  I threatened my Thing Held Dear to reroll, but I still failed.  I knew that failing this personal scene meant that Gigant would be written out.  But I decided to let it go.  So Honoratka\u2019s window pops open.  The man standing there is not her father.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nGigant saw the locket lying on the ground.  Apparently it has torn off his neck while he was carrying the civilians.  So he picked it up and stuffed it in his pocket.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>While in the German encampment, Leon tries to make off with a functioning German pistol.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  snag a working weapon.)  Keith rolled a d6 and failed.  So, while Leon made off with the gun, it was being field-stripped and was useless.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nOla and her mother crouched in the rubble of a building.  For some reason, Ola\u2019s mom decided that this was a good time to start arguing with her daughter.  Crystal sighed and contributed a d8 to the mission pool.  So the German patrol passing nearby heard them fighting and released the dogs.  Ola and her mom run.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Plug is nearby and sees this happening.  Flashback to earlier this week.  His brother is patched up as best as he will be.  His group is just about out of ammunition; they are all wounded.  Nevertheless, they are going out to the front lines.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  does Plug understand why his brother is making this sacrifice?)  Ralph rolled a d8 and succeeded.  So Plug stands up a little straighter and salutes as his brother fades into the distance.  Then he turns and walks the other way.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nPlug knew what he had to do.  Ralph contributed a d4 to the mission pool and rolled.<br/>\n<br/>\nFailure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Plug leapt from his hiding place and ran towards the dogs, distracting them from Ola and her mom.  Then he ran, the dogs hot on his heels.  The last camera shot is of his shoes, racing through the dark, with the feet of the dogs following close behind.  One of them jumped for Plug\u2019s back\u2026.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, back at the German encampment, a German officer entered the camp and told them that the information on the breakout was incorrect.  He directed the sentries to the proper location.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe firelight fell on the officer\u2019s face, revealing his identity.  Hans had made a deal, selling out the Grey Ranks in exchange for the lives of Ola and her mother.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the civilians except Ola\u2019s mother were captured and executed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Ola is pregnant, remember.  So she and her mom make their escape and are huddled in an alley somewhere.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  keep control of her emotions).  Much to everyone\u2019s surprise, Crystal rolled a d8 and succeeded.  So, Ola keeps herself under control.  There\u2019s still work to be done.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nI singled out Gigant, which landed him on Suicidal Depression.  Plug  landed on Martyrdom.  This was the second visit for both characters, so they would be written out during their next scenes.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121054/#Comment_121054" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T15:37:00+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  3:37PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Chapter 8:  Old Town Falls and the Sewers Become a Highway</i><br/>\n<br/>\nMission Leader:  Keith<br/>\n<br/>\nSituation Elements:<br/>\nRalph:  Igo Sym, a delightful Polish actor and Nazi informant<br/>\nSeth:  A matched pair of simple white gold rings, bound with a lock of hair<br/>\nCrystal:  Late for a funeral<br/>\nKeith:  An empty Parabellum pistol<br/>\n<br/>\nMission:  Kill Igo Sym, a sympathizer who is undermining Polish morale.  Would they send children to do this?  Well, at this point, things are getting desperate\u2026.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>It\u2019s the day after the disastrous escape attempt.  The sun is shining in a little rubble-choked plaza.  The German soldiers have a beaten and battered Plug.  They put him up against a wall.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  does Plug die bravely?)  Ralph rolled a d10 and failed.  So he threatened his Thing Held Dear and rolled again.  Failure.  So I destroyed my Thing Held Dear and he rolled again.  Failure.  So he destroyed his Thing Held Dear and rolled again.  Failure.  So I reached across the table and threatened Leon\u2019s Thing Held Dear, and Ralph rolled again.  Success!  (I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the proper order of all that.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, we wanted Plug to win.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, as the German guns come up, suddenly Plug straightens up.  He wipes his face and faces the guns.  In defiance, he shouts out in devotion to Poland.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guns fire.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis body is thrown on a pile of bodies lying nearby.  After the Germans leave, some poor wretch steals Plug\u2019s shoes.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor this Chapter, Ralph converted one of Plug\u2019s reputations.  He had been \u201cunreliable\u201d.  Now he was a \u201chero of the people\u201d.</i><br/>\n<br/>\n<i> It\u2019s the day after the disastrous escape attempt.  The sun is shining in an alley.  Gigant looks up as he hears the sound of gunfire.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  find the will to care).  I rolled a d4 and failed.  He is holding the locket, but it doesn\u2019t matter anymore.  He casts it away.  Then he blows his brains out.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nOla and Leon headed to where Igo Sym is supposed to be showing up.  Crystal contributed a d10 to the mission pool, so someone tipped off Sym.  He arrived with German soldiers, who open fire on the gathered Polish partisans.  It\u2019s a disaster.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of the mission scenes fit inside this basic structure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, while Ola and Leon waited to launch their ambush, some of the Polish partisans start hitting on Ola.  It\u2019s been a while since they\u2019ve seen a woman, and they get out of hand.  I contributed a d8 to the mission pool.  Tomacz, the third member of the crew, tried to intervene to save Ola.  It\u2019s what Gigant would have done.  But he is too weak and is beaten for his efforts.  As a result, when the ambush fails, he is shot and killed.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeon actually started the fight.  He found himself in a perfect position to fire at Sym.  So he pulled out his stolen German gun.  Keith contributed a d10 to the mission pool.  Obviously, the gun didn\u2019t work.  Instead, Leon got shot for his trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the chaos and confusion, Ola saw a kid running by in Plug\u2019s shoes.  Ralph contributed a d12 to the mission pool and Keith rolled.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuccess!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, after the surviving Poles scatter, the German commander on the scene said to Sym, \u201cWe don\u2019t need you anymore\u201d and executed him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Leon sees the execution.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  does Leon avoid having a flashback of his mother\u2019s death?)  Keith rolled a d4 and failed.  So Leon sees the scene repeating over and over again.  So he crawls away into shelter and holds himself and cries.</i><br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Flashback to before the mission.  Hans has explained to Ola the nature of his deal with the Germans.  She has appeared before them and sworn fealty.  But that\u2019s not enough.  They need proof that she is seriously switching sides.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  does Ola hold fast?)  Crystal rolled a d6 and failed.  So she tells the Germans about the planned assassination of Igo Sym.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat\u2019s right.  Ola tipped the Germans off.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nKeith singled out Leon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121055/#Comment_121055" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T15:37:16+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  3:37PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Chapter 9:  The Soviets Reach the Vistula and Stop Cold</i><br/>\n<br/>\nMission Leader:  Ralph<br/>\n<br/>\nSituation Elements:<br/>\nRalph:  dozens of Polish children are rounded up at their primary school and are being used as hostages<br/>\nSeth:  an \u201cabandoned\u201d German tank, booby-trapped with explosives<br/>\nCrystal:  In the back of an armored, 3-ton Chevy German postal service bank truck<br/>\nKeith:  Betrayal<br/>\n<br/>\nMission:  rescue the Polish hostages from the school to allow the Russians to attack<br/>\n<br/>\nRalph framed the mission in a particularly heartbreaking way.  See, the Russians are just across the river, right?  Well, in Leon\u2019s head, the problem is that these Polish children are being held hostage.  So, if somehow Leon could rescue them, the Russians would attack and save them all.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Leon gathered his weaponry and ammunition.  I contributed a d4 to the mission pool.  If Gigant could lug all this stuff, then so could Leon!  It wasn\u2019t really weapons, though.  It was empty bandoliers and grenade boxes full of rocks and stuff like that.  Leon was hovering on the verge of derangement, after all.  It made sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nOla was inside the school, trying to take care of the children.  Ralph contributed a d4 to the mission pool.  So the children were telling each other stories about Plug, the hero of the Uprising.  About how he stole a tank and attacked the Germans.  How he commandeered a German bomber and used it to airdrop supplies to the Poles.  How his brother was a general in the Home Army.  The stories kept getting bigger and more improbable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Germans were growing tired of all the noise from the children.  So they told Ola to keep them quiet.  Crystal donated a d10 to the mission pool.  So, Ola tried to tell the children about how she knew Plug.  But they didn\u2019t believe her, and began arguing with her.  So one of the German soldiers came back into the room and clubbed one of the children to death with the butt of his rifle.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Plug is in heaven.  He and his brother have their shoes off and are kicking their feet in the water.  They\u2019re fishing together.  Everything is good.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  Plug dies before realizing that it\u2019s a hallucination.)  Ralph rolled a d12 and was successful.  So Plus dies happy.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nNow Leon attacked the school.  Keith contributed a d8 to the mission pool and rolled.<br/>\n<br/>\nFailure.  Like we\u2019re really surprised, you know.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Leon charged the school, throwing rock \u201cgrenades\u201d and making all the sound effects himself.  A German soldier came out to see what was going on, and Leon pulled out his gun.  Much to everyone\u2019s surprise, there was an actual live round in the gun, and Leon shot the German soldier.  But it wasn\u2019t enough.  Leon was shot in the shoulder and captured.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Leon is all that is left of the original crew.  Everyone else is dead or turned.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  Leon avoids survivor\u2019s guilt.)  Keith rolled a d10 and failed, so Leon is left feeling guilty that he is still alive somehow.</i><br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Flashback to last summer.  Gigant is wandering out to this farm.  His parents made him go and he doesn\u2019t want to.  So he\u2019s in a bad mood.  Someone asks him to help carry something.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  have a good attitude at the farm.)  I rolled a d4 and failed.  So Gigant loses his temper and beats up the person asking for help.</i><br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Ola is now left with Hans.  (Goal of Personal Scene:  have a happy life with Hans)  Crystal rolled a d8 and failed.  So, instead, Hans is transferred out, but he leaves her in the care of one of his friends.  He is an awful man and turns Ola into the camp whore.  She is repeatedly gang raped by the Germans.  And then, one night, as she huddles in the corner of her room, someone tosses her a piece of bread.  She picks it up and sings, \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to herself.  Happy 17th\u2026</i><br/>\n<br/>\nRalph singled out Leon, which meant that he slipped through the Derangement corner and into Martyrdom.  So, Leon would be written out next scene.  Yes, technically that is in the epilogue, but it still worked out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121056/#Comment_121056" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-21T15:37:30+00:00" title="January 21, 2008  3:37PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Chapter 10:  Capitulation</i><br/>\n<br/>\nChapter 10 is all about epilogues.  Where do the characters end up after the end of the Uprising?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlug and Gigant don\u2019t get epilogues.  Or, rather, we played out their epilogues already.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeon ended up in the same prison camp as Ola.  One night, he interrupted a German soldier raping Ola.  Leon had managed to make a shiv, and he used it on the soldier.  He stopped the rape, but he didn\u2019t kill the soldier.  Enraged, the soldier choked Leon to death.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime passes\u2026.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is now 1981.  <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Solidarity" rel="nofollow">Solidarity</a> is beginning to shake the foundations of Polish society.

Instead, she told him that she named him after his father, who died protecting her.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeon\u2019s daughter is fifteen.  She\u2019s a feisty one, too, running messages for the developing Solidarity movement and engaged in other anti-Communist activities.  Reminds Ola a bit of herself.  She quietly encourages these activities, remembering her own youth.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut her granddaughter is still human and still needs love.

In a way, I think that it was a bit of a bonding experience for our group, similar to a previous experience that we had playing <i>Primetime Adventures</i>.  Maybe I\u2019m reading a lot into it, but I think that this will go down in the annals of our gameplay as being one of Those Games.<br/>\n<br/>\nRalph had some good things to say over <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=25538.msg246275#msg246275" rel="nofollow">here</a> about the Grid and such that I didn\u2019t want to get lost, and also because they bear repeating over here.  In short, the Grid=good!<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Being cruel to your crewmates</i><br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Grey Ranks</i> isn\u2019t all hippie improvisation.  There is a definite \u201cscrew your neighbor\u201d angle to the game that is very interesting to me.  It manifests itself in at least three ways that I noticed:<br/>\n<br/>\n--deliberately framing mission scenes that a player does not want to fail but, due to available dice, must fail<br/>\n<br/>\n--Singling out a character<br/>\n<br/>\n--Using someone else\u2019s Thing Held Dear<br/>\n<br/>\nRalph picked up on the first item fairly quickly.  Indeed, he seemed to relish the opportunity to make the other players squirm.  Particularly me, come to think of it.  Hmm.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other items were really only used once apiece, and I did the using of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRalph had discussed wanting a martyr\u2019s ending for Plug.  At the end of Chapter 7, I knew that I could save Plug by singling him out.  But, honestly, I wanted him to have a martyr\u2019s outcome.  I asked Ralph if that was a problem, and he rightly dodged the question.  It wasn\u2019t his choice; it was mine.  So I took it, singling out Gigant instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, during Plug\u2019s last stand before the firing squad, we <i>really</i> wanted Plug to win.  So much so that, as Ralph continued to roll badly, I used a Thing Held Dear slot off Keith\u2019s sheet.  Literally reached across the table and marked it off.  Keith wasn\u2019t particularly pleased by this, but such is life.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt occurs to me that Ralph and I were far more willing to put the screws to other players than Crystal and Keith.  I wonder what this says about us\u2026.0<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>A word on Chapter 9</i><br/>\n<br/>\nOla\u2019s sad fate in Chapter 9 deserves some special discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nRape in games is dangerous territory.  Very dangerous.  There have been discussions in various forums about the use of in-game rape to play power games with other players at the table, especially female players.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it\u2019s important to note that <i>Crystal</i> was the one who introduced the gang rape angle of Ola\u2019s fate.  I didn\u2019t sense any coercion on her part; she chose to go into that territory.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat bit about the bread and the birthday?  Crystal\u2019s narration.  That\u2019s where she chose to go with the character, and we went with her.  (By the way, it hurts me whenever I think of that part.  Even writing it up for this report was hard.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Another word on bleakness</b><br/>\n<br/>\nIn my last report, I said, \u201cAt this point, I figured that I\u2019d give a special word to the reputation that this game has earned as being bleak.  It is certainly heavy material, and the situations are often intense and heavy.  However, I do not think that it\u2019s fair to depict this game as being bleak and hopeless.\u201d  I figured that I would return to this comment, now that we have finished the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, <i>Grey Ranks</i> is a hard game.  A very hard game.  But I would still argue that it is not bleak.  I would argue that, with the exception of Gigant, the various characters actually had good endings.  Consider the character arcs:<br/>\n<br/>\n--Plug goes from being a punk kid with no sense of honor or responsibility to dying a martyr\u2019s death, sacrificing his life to save someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Leon goes from being a whimpering coward, afraid of a bum with a knife, to single-handedly attacking a German installation and, in the end, fighting a German soldier to save a friend.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Ola goes from being a rebellious girl, intent on ditching her family for the sake of her peer group, to understanding and embracing both her family and her country.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, Gigant is the tragic figure in the game.  Perhaps if he had matured earlier, if Honoratka had seen his compassionate side emerging, things might have been different.  As it was, he was useful because of his size, but no one really connected with him.  In the end, he died alone.  And that, I grant, is heartbreaking.<br/>\n<br/>\nRalph said that this would have made an excellent independent film.  It would be in Polish, of course, and subtitled, but you\u2019d be able to understand the underlying universal themes.  I think that he is right.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I stand on my opinion:  <i>Grey Ranks</i> is not a bleak game without hope.  And I think that my crew will stand with me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Conclusion</b><br/>\n<br/>\nJason, it\u2019s a dangerous thing to connect the world of games to real-life events.  People can think that you\u2019re being flippant or disrespectful.  I know that you did not approach <i>Grey Ranks</i> in this way.  I know that you desire this to be a gesture of respect to the real Polish teens who gave their lives in the defense of their country.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that you have succeeded.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a worthy testament to the boys and girls of the <i>Szare Szeregi</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nI commend you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="Kotwica_symbol.png" class="bbcode_img" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Kotwica_symbol.png"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
