I want to preface this by saying I have not read the game. I feel like a hectoring mom in the 1980s: I don't know much about the game but I know it makes me uneasy. Ok, so, that disclaimer out of the way:<br/><br/>My understanding is that all characters in Dirty Secrets are split into two groups, white and non-white. I also understand that they are several other dimensions that they're split along. However, this white/non-white thing bothers the fuck out of me. In modern American race relations, there are many more shades of gray than this seems to intimate. Off the top of my head, there were recently (and still may be) serious tensions in Los Angeles between black and Latino gangs.<br/><br/>So there are two parts to my reactions here. One is fully legitimate I feel, and the other is potentially illegitimate. I'll start with the worst, first.<br/><br/>I hear "white and non white" and I get irritable. Because I'm white, however, I find myself in great suspicion of my reaction. I get annoyed at myself and investigate why I'm irritable. I reflect and decide that it makes me feel like I'm probably going to be lectured to, patronized. I then think that it's unfair of me to leap to that conclusion but I cannot think of another reason why things would be so simplified.<br/><br/>That leads to the what-I-think-is-legitimate concern, which I mentioned above. If the game is in part about race relations (and I think putting something like this white/non-white thing in there means it is), it seems irresponsible to me to simplify things so much.<br/><br/>What do you think? I am willing to be disabused. I'm wondering also if anyone else is bothered.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114740/#Comment_114740" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-17T07:23:21+00:00" title="December 17, 2007  7:23AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you should read the game before talking about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114741/#Comment_114741" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-17T07:25:40+00:00" title="December 17, 2007  7:25AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I think you should read the game before talking about it.</blockquote>\nOf course that's good advice. However, what if I think it's unlikely I'll play it? Should I buy a game I'm not going to play? What I'd like is for someone who has it, has read it, or has played it, to tell me their take on this issue. I'm putting it out there pretty clearly that I'm not fit to judge, so I'd like to see what people's perspectives are on this issue.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to start shit or crap on Seth.

You're not playing a latino gang detective investigating black gangs, you're playing a detective under Mark Furman's LAPD investigating Both Gangs.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>I reflect and decide that it makes me feel like I'm probably going to be lectured to, patronized.</blockquote>\nIt's more to ensure that you don't have a game where all factions sort of live in a make-believe fairy world, where the Vietnamese gang has Latino and White members and cooperates with the Black police detective investigating their drug ties. If you found LA Confidential, Law and Order, The Wire or heck even The Godfather (Vito Corleone about not selling drugs to whites, only to blacks) patronizing, then you'll find this patronizing as well. OK, so maybe Law and Order is patronizing, but for different reasons. :-)<br/><br/>It's no-punches-held genre and worldly emulation that's honest without feeling too forced. You can turn up the heat (LA Confidential on blacks and latinos) or turn it down (Law and Order) as you see fit. <br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114752/#Comment_114752" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-17T08:17:23+00:00" title="December 17, 2007  8:17AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 17, 2007 8:19AM by Graham.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robert,  it's deliberate over-simplification to make a point.

Thanks for bringing this up!  I'm glad to have the opportunity to have a conversation about this issue.<br/><br/>I'm going to ask a quick question first, to get a sense of where you're coming from.  In the game, the options for the Race demographic are as follows:  white, black, Asian, Latino, Middle Eastern, American Indian, Pacific Islander.  I got this list from the U.S. Census form, which seemed like as neutral a source as I was going to get.  So, even though Character cards are sorted in play by "white" and "non-white", there's actually much more distinction in both rules and play.<br/><br/>Does this affect your concerns at all?<br/><br/>I'll come back to this thread in a bit and explain some of the rationale behind my design decisions, but I want to understand where you're coming from.<br/><br/>Oh, and this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>I'm not trying to start shit or crap on Seth.

In Tucson, I would do White/Latino/Other as the most natural split, but if it was Tucson twenty years ago instead of last week, it would be just White/Other. If you were working on Tony Hillerman novels it would be stupid to not have a Native classification, and the economic classification in Dick Francis novels should differentiate between Nouveau Riche and Old Money.  <br/><br/>It's a definition of the shorthand social realities described in the source material, not a prescription.

There's a quote that my sister cited from Law and Order that goes something like this:  "If you're a cop, you're not black or white.  You're blue."<br/><br/>Now, to tell an interesting story.  Leastwise, I think that it's interesting....<br/><br/>So, I ran my first alpha playtest of <i>Dirty Secrets</i> about this time last year.  It's funny to remember what's changed since then.  One of the conclusions from this playtest was that there were a <i>lot</i> of papers flying around the table.  (At that time, there was a Crime Grid for each Crime, so it was starting to get seriously overwhelming.)  We couldn't really reduce the amount of paperwork, but something needed to be done.<br/><br/>About that time, Crystal and I went on a daytrip to Champaign, and we talked about <i>Dirty Secrets</i> on the trip.  Among other things, we hashed out a "filing system" for the Character cards.  I don't remember exactly whose idea our current setup is, but we concluded that the best approach was to make the filing system a positive part of the game and not merely a necessary administrative detail.  This seemed like a good way to do it.<br/><br/>In my head, <i>Dirty Secrets</i> is partly about social critique, particularly of social power relations.  That's not all that it's about, to be sure, but it's in the mix.  The Demographics, especially combined with the local geography of the players, combines to make a powerful stereotyping tool.  "Oh, so he's a poor, black, ex-con.  So, obviously he lives in the projects over here, and he's a drug dealer, and he has three bastard children, because that's what poor black ex-cons are all about."<br/><br/>Really?<br/><br/>What about the poor black ex-con who has made a clean slate of it?  Who is working hard to provide for his family?  Who is trying to live honorably, even though he has no money?<br/><br/>Or, better yet, at my table, we're more likely to get "He's rich.  Therefore he's corrupt, a nancy-boy, and a passive-aggressive loser."  Because, hey, that's where <i>our</i> prejudices lie.<br/><br/>Robert, the entire back of the book is exactly as Graham says:  a snapshot of how the world views the characters.  It's a diagram of the power relationships in society.  Not how they <i>should be</i>, but how they are.  It is a truth that the white majority in our culture has more power than the various minorities.  It is a truth that cops have more power than non-cops, especially ex-cons.  It is true that the rich wield more power than the poor, in part because of the influence they can exert over the Law.  (Thus, the rich are closer to Law Enforcement on the chart.)<br/><br/>But what does that say about individuals?  <i>Nothing</i>.  There is no formal mechanical impact of any of this in the game.  There are no rules about (say) a rich character getting a bonus in conflict over a poor character.  I merely set up a Rorschach blot and show it to the table.  Whatever comes out in the game, <i>came from the players</i>.  It is my hope that, as this happens, the players would consider the content of the game that they are playing.  Perhaps they will begin to be able to see the lurking assumptions and prejudices that they carry themselves.

For that matter, "illegal immigrant" has shown up as a legal status in a few games from people who live near international borders.  (This one might make it into a revised edition.)<br/><br/>So, I'm all in favor of customizing the Demographic chart to fit your specific situation, with a couple of caveats.<br/><br/>First, playtest has shown that the group must have a limited selection of Demographics.  Don't let people just make stuff up.  Put together your list before play, and then stick to it religiously.<br/><br/>Second, don't try to determine in advance what issues you'll address.  I've found that our games end up revolving around one or two Demographic categories, but I could never have predicted which one at the beginning of the game.  One game, Age was the important one.  (The story focused on three generations of a Chinese family.  The grandmother has emigrated when the mother was around 8.  The generation and culture gaps were at the heart of what that game was about, and Age provided the necessary generational stress.)  Instead, simply establish a Demographic list that would allow you to pigeon-hole someone using the categories that are in use in your home town.  I happen to think that the default list works out quite well for most of the United States, but someone else may disagree.

The game is not about lecturing people on why they should feel white guilt or anything like that.  I briefly discuss the general issue of abuse of power (as in, one paragraph) in the Designer's Notes, but I'm pretty sure that this is the only formal discussion of the matter in the text.  Rather, this is something that is knit into the game to draw out reactions from players.  Maybe they seize onto it and use it; maybe it's simply background color.  I'm just trying to provide the tools to allow players to ask some questions of themselves and each other, while they tell a rockin' crime story.<br/><br/>Does this address your concern, Robert?

I'm not in favor of sanitized entertainment by any stretch of the imagination.<br/><br/>I wonder what I'm doing wrong to make that so unclear.</blockquote>\nIt's just that the concern comes off (to me) as if you've got a blindspot to the idea that the aforementioned reduction of complexity <i>is verisimilitude</i> in the sense of the operational perspectives of various bureaucracies (law-enforcement and otherwise) out there in the world. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Then again, this is <i>my</i> baggage on the whole thing.<br/><br/>As usual, the internet steals our ability to understand that we're on the same page.

It's important to the genre that things be easily reduced to stylized categories - either as social criticism (for example, from 1900-1930 or so, divorce laws were such a big target and plot issue of mysteries that in 1926 Bobert Rohl posted to the Telegraphnet that "I AM HIGHLY CONCERNED RE DIVISION OF PERSONS INTO EXCLUSIVE MARRIED UNMARRIED WIDOWED AND DIVORCED CATEGORIES STOP") or, yes, as racial stereotyping (there is a whole chapter of 'Gun in Cheek', which details "alternative" (aka lousy) mystery classics called "C-H-I-N-K-S!" that is an educational read on the subject of race stereotyping and 'Yellow Peril' fiction.)  Hell, the decision to make a character male or female is incredibly different if you are talking about a Stephanie Plum-esque novel or a Harry Bosch-esque novel or an Ed McBain-esque novel. <br/><br/>Custom (but yes, still limited) demographics is a great add-on to Dirty Secrets, but what you've got is not in any way bad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114914/#Comment_114914" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-18T01:10:15+00:00" title="December 18, 2007  1:10AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When playing this in a Norwegian setting, we changed the ethnicities a bit to reflect what's going on in our society.

That's why the chart is designed like that.  As I mentioned earlier, the divisions inherent on the chart are all about power relations.  Now, the game doesn't <i>force</i> any of that to be part of the fiction.  The procedures merely point at it and say, "Interesting, huh?"  What the players do with this is up to them.<br/><br/>But the chart is one game component of many, and the internal structure of the game is more complex than the chart might appear to indicate.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115074/#Comment_115074" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-18T11:57:40+00:00" title="December 18, 2007 11:57AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2007 11:58AM by jenskot.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really enjoyed playtetsing and later playing Dirty Secrets. The chart in question is very impactful!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I think I understand what Rob is referencing in regards to the Wire (my favorite show!). In season 2, they pretty much blatantly say that the polish people are the black people that season. It's complicated. I'm considered white in NY but considered non-white in many other places in the world. Sometimes white / non-white becomes an economic issue. In other cases, often depending on how black you are, no matter how well off you are, you can't break those barriers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I do think the issue is complicated, I like how Seth went  with the direct approach. It may not be the whole picture, but sometimes you have to zoom in to get a specific message across or catch people's attention. I also really like some of the house rule options mentioned in this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120026/#Comment_120026" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T19:41:42+00:00" title="January 16, 2008  7:41PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played Dirty Secrets with three other players this past weekend. I was the investigator and facilitatior (I bought and read the book). With the story games I'm trying out I do my best to stick to the rules and not second guess anything until I've tried it out. This usually works very well and Dirty Secrets was no exception. There were several concepts/rules that I didn't fully "get" until we played and nearly all of them clicked - with one exception. <br><br>From reading the book I didn't really get why the characters needed to be arranged around the board by class and race. But we did it anyway to see how it worked out. After the game, one of the players said, "Why did we do that?" and I said, "I don't know, what did you think of it?" And the players agreed that it served no purpose and could be pointlessly offensive. They recommended that I not use that part of the game in the future (I'm running it at a con soon).<br><br>Now I want to be clear that we assigned demographics to the character based on our local situation and that worked very well. I specifically asked and the players were all for keeping the demographic elements of the game, just not the sorting mechanism. <br/><br/>So maybe this has something do to with living in Colorado (not a lot of race issues, historically) or maybe since some of the players (my self included) are former military and are used to working in a color-blind environment. I don't know, maybe I screwed it up somehow. I just bought the book and facilitated the game for some friends, so I didn't have a chance to learn it by playing it at Gen Con. So maybe there's something to it that I missed, but I reread some parts of the book after the fact and I couldn't find anything. So I think I'm going to take their advice and not use the sorting at the convention.<br/><br/>Personally I don't believe in white privilege and didn't realize until I found this thread (today) that that was the intent of the mechanic (so I don't think that influenced the play of the game). I really don't think you need to use this game to send a political message. I think you might lose some potential players by doing so. I want to see your game succeed because I think it's a great game, so please take these comments in that light.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120029/#Comment_120029" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-16T19:53:46+00:00" title="January 16, 2008  7:53PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see how if you don't believe in white privilege the procedure isn't going to work for you.

I\u2019m glad that you enjoyed it and that it was a positive experience for you.<br/><br/>Now to address your concern.<br/><br/>First, you need to have <i>some</i> way to sort the Characters.  This is purely for administrative purposes.  Early on in playtest, we noticed that there were a lot of pieces of paper flying around.  You need to be able to view the gamestate all at once; otherwise, the players become confused trying to keep track of what Characters are available and who they are.<br/><br/>I don\u2019t like games with lots of administrative details required to play.  So I was looking for ways to make the administrative handling part of the game.  One of my core playtesters (i.e. my wife) suggested this sorting procedure, and we were off to the races.<br/><br/>Let's talk about white privilege!<br/><br/>Actually, let's not.  Instead, let's talk about me for a moment.<br/><br/>Just to give my <i>bona fides</i>.  I'm a half-Swedish, half-Hispanic, half-Jewish mutt.  I'm a conservative Christian.  Personally, religion does <i>way</i> more to shape my view of the world than race.  I'm politically conservative, but only when that syncs up with being a Christian.<br/><br/>In other words, I don't fall into the camp of people normally associated with concern about "white privilege".<br/><br/>At the same time, I acknowledge that racial divisions do indeed exist.  I don't even mean that there are <i>necessarily</i> power imbalances.  However, being white is the baseline in this culture.  Being of another race is a deviation from the norm.  Please note: there's no value judgment here.  I'm just saying that, for most Americans, if I start describing someone, the mental picture is of a white person unless I specify a different race.<br/><br/>Now, I do also assert that there are power struggles in this society along various lines, including race.  Again, no value judgments here.  I'm just taking a look out at the world and reporting what I see.<br/><br/>At this point, I'll allow myself a slightly snarky comment.  Race seems to be the hot button here.  I've yet to hear anyone object to singling out cops, or rich people.  I wonder why that is?<br/><br/>Snarkiness off.<br/><br/>But let's say that it doesn't work that way.  Well, a lot of people seem to <i>think</i> that it does.  So, even if it's false, the <i>perception</i> of this division drives a lot of the strife in our society today.  And, whether real or perceived, it can be a great engine to drive a story.<br/><br/>Honestly, the whole thing is designed to provoke a reaction from the players to the Characters in the game.  The chart on the back of the book tells you where society pigeon-holes these Characters.  Doesn't mean that <i>you</i> have to.  In fact, you probably shouldn't.  But the chart provides the social context within which you are working.<br/><br/>This is a good time to touch on this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>I do recognize white privilege but can be counted among those that aren't sure the race demographics part of the game will add all that much to the game/genre emulation.  But I haven't played it yet.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\n<i>Dirty Secrets</i> isn't really about genre emulation.  That's <i>my</i> dirty secret.  Rather, it's my attempt to bring the sensibility of a certain genre to life while stripping away the conventions that have cluttered it up.  I tried to do something similar with high fantasy in my previous game <i>Legends of Alyria</i>.  We can argue about whether or not I succeeded, but those were my goals.<br/><br/>I view detective noir as being about public justice being levied on hidden sins.<br/><br/>Not crimes; sins.  As I've noted elsewhere, <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> is a religiously themed noir game.  <i>Dirty Secrets</i> is about the sins of the Characters.<br/><br/>So, what drives the Characters to commit sins?  Pride and greed, pretty much.<br/><br/>But that means that you're taking from someone else, using power to gain what you desire.  And what forms of power are available to you to abuse?<br/><br/>Thus the Demographics.<br/><br/>In my experience, a given game of <i>Dirty Secrets</i> ends up being "about" one of the Demographics.  There's no way to know which one at the beginning of the game; finding out is part of the joy of play.  Everything else tends to fade into the background of simple characterization.<br/><br/>You'll have to trust me on this.  I have indeed seen it arise in my own playtests, and I've seen it in the various AP reports that have come back to me.  Just don't think about it in play, and see what happens naturally.  You may be surprised.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120251/#Comment_120251" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T18:34:26+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  6:34PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that the demographics are essential to the game. It was just the sorting that didn't click with my group. <br/><br/>Thanks for the detailed response, it's all much clearer now. I was going to cut the sorting chart out the game, but I'm going to have to rethink that now. Maybe I'll look at alternatives as you suggest in the book. One of my players suggested writing all the characters on a white board for everyone's easy reference during the game, so maybe that's an alternate solution.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Great Wolf</cite>Race seems to be the hot button here.

I wonder why that is?</blockquote>\nI think it's because the White / Non-White division looks like separate bathrooms in Alabama in 1955. This a specific division we are not supposed to make in our society. When you sort by income, legal status, or even gender these are accepted categories. Even sorting by specific race can be okay; like you said it's from the census form. But I think anytime you sort people by race there is a knee-jerk "Why are you doing that?" When you see election/poll results they often break it down by race, but they don't break it down to whites and everybody else. <br/><br/>And then you can get into issues like a lot of hispanics self-identifying as white (hence the category on some forms of "white, non-hispanic") becuase hispanic/latino isn't technically a "race" separate from white. And where do Jews fit in the White / Non-White division? These aren't the kind of issues the game and the players want to address.<br/><br/>But I'm making mountains out of mole hills here, and completely theorizing based on my own reactions and experiences. The specific sorting mechanism is a very minor part of the game and it's clear that your intent was not to offend/incite. So maybe you made a mistep, but it's a really small one in a great game.<br/><br/>In fact my bigger problem with the game right now is the dice mechanic! It's unfamiliar to most gamers (was to all five people I've tried it with) and therefore a little slow to learn. I think it would be great with a regular group that could play the game in multiple sessions and get better at Liar's Dice. But I'm running it in a four-hour convention slot so I've got to figure out how to teach it and use it well in that limited time. I think it's doable, but definitely the biggest challenge in running the game (the rest almost runs itself).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_120252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy" title="scottdunphy"><img alt="scottdunphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/scottdunphy">scottdunphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120252/#Comment_120252" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-17T18:37:19+00:00" title="January 17, 2008  6:37PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite>One of the things the race and class split around the board did for our game was add diversity.

Normally I don't like to explain rules or have rules explained to me during a convention game; I'd rather learn during play. For most games that works, but for the Lair's Dice mechanic the players need to understand it well enough to make decisions on bidding and calling. So I need to teach it at the start.<br/><br/>I was just thinking of demoing it with one player, but your idea is better and I'm going with that.
