I read the title of this thread as <i>The Mary Sue: a roleplaying game for the shy and cerebral</i>.  I was about to get out my wallet to buy it just on the strength of the name!  I can really relate, since I've spent much of my roleplaying career wanting to get into the roleplaying aspect more deeply and not quite managing.  <br/><br/>If someone is really nervous about roleplaying in public, I think a one-on-one game will do more to get them started than any amount of well-meaning advice.  If the GM would be willing to run a solo story for the shy player starring the same character she'll later use in the group, it would help tremendously with getting into the character and also make it a lot easier for her to feel comfortable negotiating the IC/OOC split.  It's a lot easier to get into this kind of thing if it's just two people and the other one is doing all the funny voices and things.  Then it's a lot easier to do the same thing with more people around, once you've had the experience that your roleplaying was adequate for the task and the GM seemed to like it.  <br/><br/>Also, the advice about immersion vs. actor stance might be good, but it would be really helpful to find out <i>what the shy player actually likes and what she thinks she's having trouble with</i>.  She might be full-on into immersion and having trouble getting into with the group because nobody else plays that way.  Or if she's into actor stance, maybe she's being perfectionistic, or just playing her character too subtly, so the roleplaying is there, but not big and bold enough to be appreciated in a group of expressive, extroverted gamers.  I had to learn to overact a bit in order to get heard.  Or maybe she's somebody who doesn't mind roleplaying the interesting bits, like where her character confronts her father's killer, but can't be bothered roleplaying out the process of buying drinks in the tavern.  It's like a massage -- there's lots of ways for it to go wrong, but only communication will let you figure out how to fix it.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422665/#Comment_422665" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-09T15:33:09+00:00" title="October  9, 2013  3:33PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm a little disappointed.
