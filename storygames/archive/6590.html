But the Down's Syndrome part is fuzzy for me. The situations on the cards are so non-specific to Down's Syndrome, or rather, are so broadly applicable to the raising of any child, that (unless Catherine's player is as familiar with Down's Syndrome as you are) you've written a game about raising a child, not one about raising a child who's "different".<br/><br/>I think if you leave the game as is, what you'll get in play is either:<br/><br/>1. Scenes about ordinary childhood issues (perhaps making the point, accurate or not, that children with Down's Syndrome have the same issues as children who don't).<br/>2. Scenes that mischaracterize or over-characterize Down's Syndrome as something it isn't; perhaps an honest expression of parental fears, done privately as you've written the game, but not a particularly useful exploration of parenting, unless all you care about is the emotional catharsis of irrational fears.<br/><br/>If what you want is really a game about raising a child who's different, my recommendation would be to ditch the Down's Syndrome specification entirely, and to generalize Catherine simply as being "different". Then, implement some cards that gradually define her difference over the course of play. For these cards, draw broadly from such sources as The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime, articles on ADD (or rather, maybe one of Thom Hartmann's better books), your reading on Down's Syndrome, The Highly Sensitive Child (by Elaine Aron, I believe), Beggars in Spain, Ender's Game, etc.<br/><br/>And then Catherine will be differently "different" for each game, depending on the cards that come up.<br/><br/>Paul                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146372/#Comment_146372" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T07:52:30+00:00" title="May 28, 2008  7:52AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Matthijs,<br/><br/>You mention that you have two children, and it occurred to me while reading it that by only having one child in the game, you miss out on illustrating and exploring the differences between a "different" child and their sibling.  I like Paul's idea about generalizing difference, and I think the tight focus is a good choice, but I wonder what would happen if you mirrored scenes with two different children, or had each child do a card in sequence.

I want this to be answered by the players, through play. I believe this will highlight the players' conscious, unconscious and semi-conscious beliefs about "special" children, child-rearing, and - last but not least - the relative values of lives. <br/><br/>In Norway, there's a debate about whether or not it's right to abort a foetus with Down's. This game can also be seen in that context.<br/><br/>Jason, having two children in play is very interesting. It will complicate the game, and bring some more issues so that it's not as tightly focused; however, it will probably add a sound "reality check" as the normal sibling demands to be treated fairly - for a whole range of values of "fairly". I think I'd want to play the game as written first, and then perhaps expand it with a sibling - and possibly an additional parent. Quite possible to do within one evening of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146390/#Comment_146390" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T08:59:43+00:00" title="May 28, 2008  8:59AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Matthijs,<br/><br/>A child who can't sleep, one who's angry at her father, who's dealing with meanness from peers, a father who has an irrational concern that something's wrong, who's in love, but hasn't yet told his child, etc., all of these are ordinary parenting situations. You know this. You couldn't possibly have written so many ordinary situations if it weren't a conscious decision.<br/><br/>With these situations the only thing to take the game into the realm of "difference" is your statement that Catherine has Down's Syndrome.<br/><br/>I'm not suggesting you specify "differences between the lives lived by normal and 'special' children" in a way that telegraphs a "relative value" answer to your premise. I'm suggesting cards something like this:<br/><br/>"No matter what Catherine does with make-up or clothing, she cannot hide facial characteristics that reveal to others that she's different."<br/><br/>"Catherine takes everything she's told at face value."<br/><br/>"Catherine is easily overstimulated, and as a result, avoids or sticks to the margins of group activities that others would find pleasurable."<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146395/#Comment_146395" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T09:17:38+00:00" title="May 28, 2008  9:17AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2008 9:19AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man, good point, Paul - there are ways to incorporate pedagogy into the game so that players who follow the rules actually learn about Down Syndrome as well as have a meaningful and fun game.<br/><br/>And Matthijs, I'd imagine only two players "on stage" at any time, regardless of whether there are other parents or siblings.

That's what I want. What the game is saying, at a certain level, is "You're in situation X. What do you imagine that's like? Will you still have the same opinion after playing?" I think it's going to be pretty much impossible for players not to self-reflect and discuss in the aftermath of the game. <br/><br/>I think the card ideas are good, but would make for a very different game - one in which players are guided towards more specific problems and issues, which will make it much easier for them to see Catherine as a collection of abnormal traits rather than a person.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146435/#Comment_146435" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T11:10:30+00:00" title="May 28, 2008 11:10AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's been some whispering back and forth, and my conclusion right now is that I need to let this game rest for a while before discussing it - it's too fresh for me to look at in a remotely objective fashion yet. <br/><br/>I'll come back to this thread in a couple of days - if anyone else wants to post in the meanwhile, feel free, and I'll reply when I get back!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146450/#Comment_146450" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T11:29:24+00:00" title="May 28, 2008 11:29AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Matthijs,<br/><br/>Let's say Jason and I were to play it.

So I'm thinking, <i>well, I could have Catherine screeching unintelligibly and slamming her head repeatedly against the wall in frustration,</i> but I'm doubtful of my understanding of Down's Syndrome. I'm clueless about it really, and I know I am. So I'll just play it safe. "Dad, I can't sleep."<br/><br/>So, Jason could have Chris say, "Did you remember to take your meds?" But he knows he's just as clueless about Down's Syndrome as I am. So he plays it safe too. "Do you want to talk about it?"<br/><br/>And so what you get is rather pedestrian scenes of the ordinary challenges of child rearing.<br/><br/>Unless one of us decides to push the envelope. But we're modern guys, right, we're conditioned to steer clear of even the perception of insensitivity. So we might push the envelope, but it'll never be about "difference".

We talked a little about it between scenes, and tried to figure out how Catherine would feel and act. I felt like I'd want some sort of chart saying what sort of skills, attitudes, cognitive level she'd have at three, five, nine, eleven... Perhaps this could be written on the cards. However, people with Down's can develop in many different ways and at many different speeds, so perhaps the game should start with a discussion of what sort of child Catherine is?<br/><br/>We switched roles along the way, alternating between scenes who played Chris and who played Catherine. I'm not sure that was a good idea. It would have been better to alternate between games, I believe.<br/><br/>I made one big mistake: I didn't warn the other player of the end card, and it came as a surprise - an emotional shock. It's allright, we talked about it and worked it out; I apologized for my stupidity. However, this clearly needs to be stated up front, and perhaps there should be different optional end cards, so players can select what sort of story they want.<br/><br/>Now that I've got the game more at a distance, I'm liking some of the suggestions on this thread a lot more. Having different cards that make Catherine different from game to game is a good idea - however, in real life, the parents would probably know her diagnosis from early on in many cases; if a child is born with Down's, for example, they would know.

I think it's going to be pretty much impossible for players not to self-reflect and discuss in the aftermath of the game. <br/></blockquote>\nThe thing is, if you don't get any new input, you'll leave the same way you came forward. I think what Paul is saying, that for a Down's Syndrome deck (or any "Difference Deck"*), you need to actually give more details, especially about things many people are not familiar with: what it means to have Down's, how is it different from a kid who's suffering problems that you'd describe the same ("Can't sleep"), etc. There needs to be something that gives the players extra input, or as in Paul's example above, they will not leave with their opinions on Down's changed, simply because there was nothing to affect change (they came with knowledge X, they played according to knowledge X, and came out with 'conclusions' that were drawn from knowledge X).<br/><br/>* I like my term :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_178811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178811/#Comment_178811" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-15T14:00:42+00:00" title="November 15, 2008  2:00PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, what's up with this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_178867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/178867/#Comment_178867" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-16T02:13:09+00:00" title="November 16, 2008  2:13AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't really done anything more with it.
