I'm debating if it's worth finishing(near completion) and putting in the additional effort to publish it. So I wanted to ask here among more experienced players if it seems like a good gaming engine. I tried to design it so that it was a table-top first, but could easily be converted to a video game or even a card game without changing the gaming mechanics. It's kinda are to explain how it works, but my legal advice was not to disclose my formulas or algorithms.<br/><br/>The game features 5 playable races, each with 5 sub-races. It has 5 attributes, divided into 3 categories of: Physical, Mental, and Spiritual. There are 120 skills to build, with additional skills that can be had if the player joins a profession guild(joining a guild is not required). There are 16 profession guilds, and 10+ artisan guilds. There are 300 spells in the game, all of which are unique.  The game features weapon/armor breakage mechanics, but not required. It also features environment mechanics, but not required. To also features mass army battles/territory/town mechanics, but not required. There are also item &amp; spell creation &amp; improvement mechanics, but not required. There are also detailed/specific item value mechanics never used before in a table-top game, but not required.<br/><br/>All in all the game is massive, covers everything I could think of. What makes the game really different is that skills are leveled up individually based on success, rather than the whole character. There is no character level, but a character's fame is the closest thing to that. The way the formula works, is that the easier it is to succeed the attempt, the less XP for that skill you get. The harder the successful attempt, the more XP for that skill you get. I choose skill leveling for a few reasons. One that it didn't make sense to me for a character to level up, and improve skills never/hardly used. Another reason is that an highly experienced character can play with low experienced characters and be close to equals by simply using skills that are less developed. For example, the experienced character is highly skilled in edged weapons, but could switch over to blunt weapons with new character/players for more balanced gameplay without having to make another character to fit in with the group power-wise.<br/><br/>My fears about the game is that it may be too complicated for beginners. The skill formula is slightly complicated I feel (although my wife had no idea what she was looking at and couldn't even begin the equation). Also, I think tracking various skill levels might be over-whelming for some. I tried to design it so that various gaming mechanics would not be required in order to play, but be available at a whim for more experienced players looking for more of a challenge. <br/><br/>So has anyone here ever played a table-top RPG that used skill-leveling, rather than character leveling? Was it fun? Do you think a majority of players would like it? I would like to hear some feedback on what I've described thus far, and I can answer questions if you have them. I am also open to suggestions.<br/><br/><b>EDIT</b>: FYI, I am 35 and I don't have anyone that can play test this game for me. Nor do I know anyone that has any D&amp;D experience that can give me some sort of feedback on what I've designed. So I came here.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432962/#Comment_432962" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-23T17:57:26+00:00" title="May 23, 2014  5:57PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I personally enjoy more complex games...D&amp;D, Shadowrun, Rolemaster, etc. All can be fun.

Then again, simple games do the same thing with people of opposite preference, so that's not necessarily a bad thing. <br/><br/>I think it's a good direction to make as much optional as possible.

There was a period of years when my friends and I concentrated on playing and building increasingly complex systems.  My own personal homegrown system at the time sounded a lot like yours in fact, it was also skill-based and had just as many spells, but even more stats.  (I divided stats into primary, secondary and variable, each with its own determination formula :-)<br/><br/>There is a class of player for that.  Now that I'm older it's not me anymore.  If I wanted to publish that system, in today's market, I think it might work better as a basis for a videogame RPG or an online RPG than a tabletop.

And sadly, that limits a lot the audience of your game. So unless your game comes with a carefully planned step-by-step fool-proof guide to masterfully GM it without too much prep nor railroady modules, that also allows GMs to sit back, relax and enjoy the game, I can't say I'd be willing to GM it.<br/><br/>I played 3.5 and Pathfinder, and certainly loved some aspects of it's complexity, unbalanced here and there as they are. The game is certainly more enjoyable when you can relax and play your character instead of taking care of the details of the math. Even hunting for loopholes in the rules, spells or the system to game it has it's appeal. But GMing them requires a level of knowledge of the system that makes me feel quite insecure about GMing them, even when I've been GMing other games fo years and hacking and designing my own for almost the same time.<br/><br/>Now, relax, the kind of GM friendly game that I describe above is actually attainable, probably without altering your system. Perhaps some of the accounting should be handled digitally but the actual GM advice needed passes trough clearly stating the philosophy of your game to the possible GMs, what kind of atmosphere you're envisioning for the game and exactly what things should the GM be doing to attain it. Also, check all you mechanics to see which ones could be oversee by players instead of the GM, and try to make everything at your hand to take the load off the GM.<br/><br/>For example, collaborative world-building is an incredible tool to bring players into the setting, make them invest on it from the start and have everyone on the same page about the whole campaign from the start. They don't have to work on all the details, that's for the GM to bring up on them later, but some basic outlines are enough to inspire the GMs to give every player what they expect from the game.<br/><br/>Allow me to go back on "Clarifying the game philosophy to the GM and the players". Is the game supposed to be lethal at low level or any level? Are the PCs strongly protected from harm but still under fear of losing their investments? Is it a full Power Fantasy where PCs can face anything and only strategy and luck decide if they overcome the challenges, but come out mostly unscathed otherwise?<br/>Is it "all of the above", as it happens with D&amp;D in different levels and for different classes? Every question here identifies a different game philosophy, which must be clear right from the start as they define different ways of playing the same game.<br/><br/>For example, if the game is lethal, players will enjoy the thrill of facing the unknown knowing their characters can die in the most unexpected way and moment. However, spending one hour or a full session to create a character that dies on the first ten minutes of gameplay is frustrating, specially if you managed to flesh it with an specially interesting background or other features.<br/><br/>If the game is a Power Fantasy it's the opposite case. Here PCs are supposed to be legendary heroes and can only die at the last battle in a glorious moment of sacrifice that will be remenbered though the ages. Here, a full session of character creation is too little time for creating these greater-than-life heroes.<br/><br/>D&amp;D works on lethal mode on the first 5 levels (unless the GM carefully balances the encounters and protects a bit the party or the players learn to play in full coward/paranoid mode), then goes to a middle ground where the PCs certainly have unique supernatural or super-human abilities, and in later levels goes into a place where only mythic creatures and gods can prove to be a good fight.<br/><br/>GMing for every kind of philosophy requires a different set of tools, procedures and social skills. For a lethal mode the GM needs to be more in control of the creative agenda, for most of the fear comes from having the players not know what they are facing and have them feel unable to face the challenge directly from the start. For a Power Fantasy the GM needs to make the players feel more confident of their skills by showering them in minions to kill by dozens, letting the players know that she can only stall but not stop them, though all she needs to do to "win" is to stall them long enough or make them use up their resources before the final battle. This prompts them into thinking better strategies to save up time and other resources, bringing interesting scenes to the game.<br/><br/>As you can see, there are a lot of these tools for GMing engraved in the system, and you must let the GMs know exactly which are which. Having modular rules is a bless but it's better to know which of those rules will produce the atmosphere the GMs are looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432970/#Comment_432970" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-23T23:57:04+00:00" title="May 23, 2014 11:57PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2014 11:59PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The types of features that you quote for your game are very common in high-end mainstream commercial rpg design. This means that you're working in the exact field where the competition has high levels of rules quality, player base, writing quality, production quality and marketing. Most successful games in the category also enjoy a significant history in the market and a very active on-going publishing program. Even worse, it's a type of game where adoption threshold is high, so people are less likely to switch to a new product for minor reasons. All that means that even assuming that your game is brilliant for its type, you're still down in 4-6 crucial categories of competitiveness already before you even have a product, not to speak of entering the market.<br/><br/>(For comparison, most independent game projects tend to be highly divergent from traditional mainstream game design. One reason for this is simply observable in the above paragraph: when you're doing something unique and different, you don't need to compete directly with the established high-end product. In that situation a more economical product is entirely feasible.)<br/><br/>All this makes the overall publishing prospects of the game pretty grim. You haven't really discussed your goals for the game here, but you mention that you're considering publication. If you are, I would recommend doing a conservative digital strategy where you make your game available for free download, and see how many people you can get to play it by discussing it a bit on the gaming forums and linking people to it. That's a good, simple starting point that doesn't require much in the way of product development, and it'll help you to gauge the interest of the scene and the quality of the competition. If the feedback at that point is promising, you can always move on to new steps in developing the product.\n<blockquote>So has anyone here ever played a table-top RPG that used skill-leveling, rather than character leveling? Was it fun? Do you think a majority of players would like it? I would like to hear some feedback on what I've described thus far, and I can answer questions if you have them. I am also open to suggestions.</blockquote>\n<i>Burning Wheel</i> uses individually leveled skills, and it also has the other bullet-points you mention. More significantly from your viewpoint, it's a very successful indie game made with a small, dedicated team in a subgenre that has all those challenges I mentioned up there. There's nothing more difficult than getting a dedicated D&amp;D gamer to read a book and decide to commit to a new campaign, yet BW seems to consistently achieve this. If I were writing a game of this type, looking for success in publishing it, I would look very carefully at Luke's recipe. (For the curious, I understand the recipe to begin with demoing your game for a couple of years in a metropolitan area, just to get the necessary grass-roots buzz and playtest polish.)<br/><br/><i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> is another successful example of a game with similar features (including individually leveled skills, although this time with build points), again published independently. It is also a worthwhile subject of examination because of how the creative and economic goals of the project were so different from Burning Wheel's, and how that influences the continuing development of the game. By contrasting the two projects one can get a good sense of what it takes to develop artistic and economic success, and what kinds of publishing strategy one might choose to use.<br/><br/>I should emphasize that every bullet point you mention for your game has been done by dozens of titles in the history of rpgs, the above two are just a couple of picks that strike me as ones you might want to look at for reasonably recent comparison and examples of how to go about publishing that sort of thing.\n<blockquote>It's kinda are to explain how it works, but my legal advice was not to disclose my formulas or algorithms.</blockquote>\nA small sermon on the matter, if I may:<br/><br/>That advice is legally sound, but practically stupid. It's stupid because your fundamental goal as a designer surely is to have people see what you've done - that is definitely your goal as a publisher. In the modern world it is very easy to publish, very easy to be pirated, but extremely hard to be noticed: your problem as an independent creator is <i>not</i> that somebody might steal your work, but rather simply that nobody will care even when you make it freely available. If you can fix the latter problem, then you're already in the most successful one percent of creators. Ten thousand independent creators languish in obscurity for every one that ever had to practically worry about plagiarism or piracy of their product. If we drop the piracy concern, then it's like a hundred thousand or a million in obscurity for every case of serious plagiarism.<br/><br/>The scenario against which secretiveness is supposed to protect you is the one where a competitor steals your brilliant ideas and beats you to market with a copycat product. This makes sense in mobile phone development or the aeroplane industry, but applying that to a field like game design is just ignorant. Anybody looking for an easy score is already working in other fields, anybody interested in making a name for themselves is not going to touch anything with the stain of plagiarism, and anybody struggling to actually create anything knows the horrible truth: ideas are cheap, and everybody has them.<br/><br/>The real work is always in product development, and why-ever would you want to develop based on stolen good ideas, when you could be developing your own legit good ideas. (If you don't have good ideas, good luck with that development work.) It's just a category error to worry about plagiarism in this context like you had some state secrets there. The absolute worst that might happen is that you'll stop publishing your thing, and ten years later you're pathetically looking at somebody else publishing something vaguely similar, and you'll be uncertain about whether they might have read your thing at some point. Who cares, everybody takes influence, and if you didn't work to bring your thing to market then it's good that somebody took those ideas and made something of them.<br/><br/>This concern over secretiveness would otherwise be merely an amusing quirk that some people bring with them to the publishing arena, except that with hobby publishers it's a pretty crippling handicap to try to follow that corporate product development secrecy protocol: if you're not showing your stuff to anybody, then you won't get feedback, won't get players, won't get buzz. What you will get is surprised when nobody knows and nobody cares about your product later on, when you try to sell it. (I assume that selling is a feature in the plan here, as otherwise the secrecy thing makes even less sense.)<br/><br/>And this cannot be emphasized enough: the social censure against plagiarism is absolutely savage in the creative industry, including the hobby publishing industry. It's a thousand times worse than any digital pirate ever faced. A publisher would basically have to be insane to grab your stuff and blatantly plagiarize it for their own product; they'd have to be willing to sacrifice their good name and reputation as human beings in a community of peers and colleagues for the dubious advantage that your ideas might provide them. (Dubious because it'd have to some friggin' amazing ideas to offset the sales lost due to customer boycotts.) Maybe if you had an anti-gravity generator instead of some dicing mechanics, that'd make sense. Maybe.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432978/#Comment_432978" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-24T11:06:30+00:00" title="May 24, 2014 11:06AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, Xarcell, and welcome to Story Games.<br/><br/>First of all, listen to Eero (the post above me) - he says most of the important stuff I thought while I read your post, and he's very knowledgeable about both game design and the publishing industry. <br/><br/>So, in short, I agree fully with Eero. But here are some additional thoughts:<br/><br/>1. Eero is entirely correct about concerns of plagiarism. It's simply not worth worrying about: most of the highly-successful indie RPGs published in the last half-decade or so were developed "in public", with most (and often all) of the game available for free. In this world, getting people to *hear* about your game is much harder than anything else. (And I've never heard of any game getting "plagiarized" and that becoming an issue in some way - people reading along, have you heard of such a story? Maybe it happened back in the 70's, but I haven't heard of that ever being an issue in more recent times.)<br/><br/>However, it occurs to me that maybe what you're trying to protect is whatever elements allow the system to be converted "into a video game or card game". I can't say without seeing the details, but I suppose it's possible there is some brilliant "technology" there that's worth protecting. Is that what you meant?<br/><br/>2. For a lot of people, particularly in this community, this kind of thing draws a particular response: \n<blockquote>It's kinda are to explain how it works [...] <br/>There are also detailed/specific item value mechanics never used before in a table-top game [...] <br/>My fears about the game is that it may be too complicated for beginners. The skill formula is slightly complicated I feel (although my wife had no idea what she was looking at and couldn't even begin the equation).</blockquote>\nThese are not usually considered selling-points, but design problems. Surely there are some gamers out there who might be excited by complexity alone, but most people, as far as I can tell, see something like this and cringe. In my experience, if a designer of a game (who, after all, has a much more intuitive grasp of the mechanics involved in their game than a new reader would) has trouble explaining his own rules and mechanics, that means the game itself will likely be hopelessly convoluted and potentially unplayable.<br/><br/>(An old chestnut called "Metascape II" comes to mind, but that may be too obscure a joke for some...)<br/><br/>3. Your post makes you sound like you're not very familiar with a variety of RPGs. For instance, your question:<br/><br/>"Has anyone here played a tabletop RPG with skill-leveling, rather than character-leveling?"<br/><br/>I'd be surprised if we could find more than a couple of people on this forum who <i>haven't</i> played such a game. It's not an uncommon design feature in commercial tabletop RPGs going back to the 80's, at least. I definitely designed a game like this myself when I was 11 years old and getting tired of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>A lack of knowledge of what's out there, if I am correct in my guess, potentially limits your design abilities as well as your understanding of the publishing market. I'd encourage you to take a look at other games out there - there are lots of free ones you can take a look at. Here are a few games which sound like they might be similar to what you're describing here:<br/><br/>* <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/" rel="nofollow">Burning Wheel</a> (I don't know if there's a free version or sample, but take a look)<br/><br/>* <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/Lite/" rel="nofollow">GURPS</a> (The link takes you to the free, mini-version of the game)<br/><br/>*<a href="http://www.jagsrpg.org/" rel="nofollow">JAGS</a> (This game is entirely downloadable for free, and worth looking through)<br/><br/>Take a look and see whether my guess is right or not - at the very least, it will tell you whether your capsule description is giving people the right impression about your game.<br/><br/>Also: don't get discouraged! You'll get lots of awesome advice and support here on this forum, and if anyone sounds critical it's because they want to help.

That's one way to get people to pay attention, and it's also a way to iterate and get a better game.<br/><br/>Luckily, today, there's a booming amount of online Hangout games. You should get on G+, RPGGeek, other places, and look to start playing other people's games, make friends, and start building a group of people who you might be able to tap on to playtest your own games.<br/><br/>Especially if your playtest experience is slim-to-none, don't value your ideas so highly. A mechanic that looks awesome on paper may play terribly. Something that seems marginal may turn out to be a total rockstar. Mechanics only exist in a greater context: talking about your mechanics with people and letting people see them will certainly help you get feedback.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Xarcell" title="Xarcell"><img alt="Xarcell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Xarcell">Xarcell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433047/#Comment_433047" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-27T06:18:02+00:00" title="May 27, 2014  6:18AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks everyone for your comments. They certainly helped me alot, but I think I should also give a little more background on it and what my goals are.<br/><br/>First off, it would be great if my made money with the project, but it's not that big of a deal. Money is not a priority for me, but it's needed to the extent to pay for server costs, etc. I'm more interested in seeing it get used, rather than sitting around thinking it has all this potential, but not really knowing, because no one else saw the darn thing. I worked on this project as a hobby without EVER playing it(14 years of development).<br/><br/>In 2000, I showed my game to some company. It was a game that I developed &amp; used during my D&amp;D days. The company contacted me back via snail mail and basically said it was utter crap. So I redesigned it from the ground up in 6 months. This time, putting 100% of my time into it, researching, etc. I didn't go the traditional route this time. I had experience with not only with D&amp;D, but also with MUD &amp; Video games at the time. That started the foundation of what I have today, but it has come along way since then. Anyway, after my redesign in 6 months, I submitted it again. This time they called me saying they wanted it. Going on and on about how it "may" be a success. However after they told me I would only get 7% royalties, and they would "finish" the game for me I politely declined. I told them on the phone that I wanted to finish the game myself, that I didn't trust that they wouldn't ruin it(in my opinion). A week later they sent a representative to my house, but it didn't change my mind. The rep went on and on how about how it would cost me around 10K-11K on patients, art, publishing, and etcetera to do it on my own. So since then, working on it has just been a hobby, because I know that I would never be able to afford to patient it on my own. His final advice was to never tell anyone my formulas &amp; algorithms, and have people sign a temporary patient/gag release before letting them play test it.<br/><br/>Then last year, someone I talked to about it said there is nothing to patient, that if I wanted I could just self-publish it. He told me I was protected by copyright and that was all I needed. That got me wanting to do something with it rather than just letting it sit there and rot.<br/><br/>The reasons I want to self publish, is because I don't want to give up control of it. I hate companies that ruin stuff because they cut corners to increase profit(look at MS). I'm the person who would much rather be known as the guy who created a great game, rather than the guy who got rich of a game.<br/><br/>For a living, I do freelance web design, graphic design, photography, technical writing(such as documentation), and web hosting. I wanted to be able to build my own site for my game and offer character sheets, paper character/creature models, maps, etc, etc, for free(look at <a href="http://www.fatdragongames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fatdragongames.com/</a> for examples). Stuff that people can just download and print themselves. I am fully capable of making this happen with the site all by myself. In fact, I've already do it twice, but ended up letting it go 2 years ago because I couldn't keep up with the amount of spam I was getting, plus try to earn a living at the same time. I even designed a section of the forum for the site to be RPG-MUD like. Where you can travel from board-to-board, with each board having it's own area description, characters could roleplay, and even battle and collect items that can be traded with one another. Although, this was a resource killer on my servers and just wasn't worth the stress of fighting spam and increasing costs for the server.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm rambling and getting side-tracked there. <br/><br/>I plan to release only 3 books for the game. Player's Guide, Game Master's Guide, and the Creature Index Guide(names not final). I wanted the player's guide to actually offer everything someone needs to play the game(besides the dice). The Game Master's Guide would only be a tool for the GM. With D&amp;D, I always felt like the GM's Guide was required to play the game well, something I wanted to avoid with my game. The Creature Guide is pretty self-explanatory, but not needed. As far as the card aspect of the game, they would be downloadable via website.<br/><br/>So I'm here asking for advice, wondering if I should put in the effort to finish it and do everything with the website. It's alot of work, and I'm not really looking forward to it. However, it bugs me to see it not getting used or even enjoyed by others. It's like this itch that I can't get rid of(been itching for 14 years). I'm was a hardcore video gamer. Now I feel these video games aren't cutting it anymore and I rarely play. Playing D&amp;D in my youth was my favorite past-time. Today, I don't really like chatting over a mike and getting so damn competitive. I'm more of a collaborator. If I finish my game, I will play it. If not, I'll most likely give pathfinder a try, but the truth is I haven't played a table-top RPG in almost 20 years. So yes, I'm out of the loop and I haven't played any skill-level based games. Although, I haven't played a table-top game I have worked on my game every summer since the year 2000. I get up, the weather is just right, it reminds me of the fun I had with D&amp;D in my youth, but since I can't play(nobody to play with) I work on improving my game. Testing it myself, renaming things, and tweaking mechanics.<br/><br/>Which brings me to a question. I've had to do 3 re-writes because I cannot best pick a software to write the darn thing on. First I started with MS Word, then I switched to Open Office because it was free and just as good in my opinion. Now I'm consider Google Docs(because I already use Google Drive alot), and considering switching to MS Word Online, because I have a Windows Surface RT. It comes with Office. However, with these online editors which I'd really like to use because it's easy to give/remove access to people, do not support colspan with their tables. Which makes it hard for me to make my data charts look good. Also, I cannot use a background with them, nor do they support mirrored margins for front/back printing. I've considered buying Publisher, and tinkered with Scribus, but I am unsure. Picking either of these two means I have to learn yet another piece of software. Again.<br/><br/>What I would like to do is leave MS and switch to Ubuntu(but doesn't support my motherboard, I've tried) and Ubuntu comes with LibreOffice(open Office Fork). So my latest write is on LibreOffice(for windows). Although, I cannot use Open/Libre office with my surface. So I'm at a loss here as what I should do my final draft on here. Any suggestions? I'm at a stage where I really want to add a background and insert images into the book.<br/><br/>Again, thanks everyone for their comments and more are welcome. Sorry about the sloppiness, as I wrote this in a hurry. I have 400+ photos that need processing for a school, and 2 websites to be built on Blogger and wordpress.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433051/#Comment_433051" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-27T07:24:28+00:00" title="May 27, 2014  7:24AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right, considering that context in light of how others go about the rpg hobby...<br/><br/>I think you should get into the scene and play for a bit. Like, play roleplaying games for a year or two, and then see what you feel like about developing and publishing your own game. It doesn't matter what you play: Pathfinder, some indie weirdness, your own game. Just play, and see what it is about roleplaying that actually matters to you. It seems to me like utter insanity to contemplate publishing when you haven't been playing for 20 years; that's like planning to open a chopper shop because you used to ride a motorcycle 20 years ago, despite not owning a single 'cycle. Would you buy a motorcycle from somebody who doesn't even ride?<br/><br/>Regarding your workflow question: separate your writing work from your book layout concerns entirely for now. Write your manuscript on parchment with a feather quill if you feel like it. Many, many people with entirely professional workflows choose to write in something like Notepad (heck, I do that myself often enough). Mark tables in whatever manner works for you while writing. Then later, when layout becomes a current concern because you've actually finished the game, you can see about importing your manuscript into a layout environment. We'll help with the practical planning when you come to that point.<br/><br/>(You can save work in layout by doing your manuscript in a sensible style - consistent styling in a word processor compatible with your layout software being a dramatic example. However, at this level of operation I don't recommend worrying about detail like that. Just get the manuscript done any way you can, that's ultimately the only thing that matters.)<br/><br/>I feel like your approach to all this is entirely jumbled up: you're planning writing a game without playing them, and publishing without having written one, and layout without a manuscript in hand. Slow down and progress logically! I believe that if you'll actually play games a bit and see what people actually do in the rpg scene, you'll gain a more realistic picture of what you might have to offer in terms of game design and development. I understand all about being in love with your own ideas, but as others have said, it is frankly pretty unlikely that your game is anything special for most gamers - we're smart people actively engaging in the hobby, you need to get up pretty early in the morning to bring a surprise <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433052/#Comment_433052" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-27T07:34:46+00:00" title="May 27, 2014  7:34AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I feel like your approach to all this is entirely jumbled up: you're planning writing a game without playing them, and publishing without having written one, and layout without a manuscript in hand.

The single most productive thing for my game designing has been playing games. RPGs, boardgames, card games, etc., etc. Gets the brain thinking about what works and what doesn't.<br/><br/>Also, on the point mentioned earlier about keeping mechanics secret...have a look at these articles by card game designer extraordinaire Daniel Solis. (He's also very involved in the RPG industry, but his most prominent work is card games and graphic design.)<br/><br/><a href="http://danielsolisblog.blogspot.com/2013/07/what-if-someone-steals-your-idea.html" rel="nofollow">What If Someone Steals Your Idea?</a><br/><a href="http://danielsolisblog.blogspot.com/2014/04/are-you-still-not-afraid-of-someone.html" rel="nofollow">Are You Still Not Afraid of Someone Stealing Your Idea?</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433054/#Comment_433054" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-27T08:29:55+00:00" title="May 27, 2014  8:29AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2014 8:34AM by WarriorMonk.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been having a similar issue with my designs and ideas, and probably even less time available thant you do, since I work to earn my living 8 horus 5 days a week and they I use most of my spare time on my second job as a self-publishing comic artist on my own small (really small) company, where I edit 5-7 other artists in a more or less irregular way. But I also love to hack all the shiny indie and trad things out there and I've been working on several games since 2002.<br/><br/>As a small publisher my advice is: Yes, finish your game, FRIGGIN' PLAY IT, show it to people, ask for more criticisn from designers and players,  go for digital self-publishing and print on demand, try using a free website (wordpress, maybe tumblr? Are there good options on Google+ for this? I'm a noob on the last two) and try keeping it as cheap and automatic as you can. By automatic I mean, like using wordpress, put there a link for downloading and disabling comments; then spam the link on forums here and there and forget about dealing with the feedback on that page; you'll simply won't have the time to do so and most of it will be spam anyway. Personally, I'm doing more or less the same thing with <a href="http://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">my roleplaying blog</a>, I only update when I have something really big, I don't even pay for a domain and though I kept comments enabled I barely receive any, nor too much spam. Nor too much attention for all that matters, but I'm okay with that, it's not like I have anything too important there. My games and tools are there for anyone to download and use, and from time to time I get a nice comment, which is enough to keep me going at it.<br/><br/>If you really really want more feedback than that, then you have to work harder, invest more time, GM it and talk to the players on person yourself at gaming conventions. Not that getting feedback from designers is that hard, all you need is put a link to your book and everyone (ok, maybe three or five people, but that's a lot for indie designers) will jump at it to offer constructive criticism (which, as you've seen is what SG is better at). Getting playtesters around here is as easy as opening a thread and asking, as long as you're clear on what's the game about and how it's supposed to be played.<br/><br/>Edit: Added cursing and Eero's advice, since it's really that important.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433058/#Comment_433058" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-27T09:56:43+00:00" title="May 27, 2014  9:56AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd add:<br/><br/>It may help, if you're totally set on this project and want to work on it regardless of what anyone says, to prepare just little bits and chunks of the game. Maybe a character sheet. Maybe a single part of the game, like a short scenario which can be played in five minutes and just the relevant rules. Maybe a section of character creation.<br/><br/>A little snippet, in other words, something people can digest in about 10 minutes, or maybe even play through. Present that here on the forum, and you'll get some reactions. People will really dig it, or not. You can then gauge the reaction to decide how much work you want to put into the game, for a fairly small time/effort investment.<br/><br/>"Here's how you make a character. Roll 3d6 in order, then choose a class. Next, buy equipment from this list. Okay, what do you think of this so far? Does it catch your attention, does it appeal to you? Are parts confusing or weird?"<br/><br/>Lots of successful designers have done this recently; it generates attention for your game, and it's much easier to get people to commit to reading a page and doing something for five minutes than it is to find people to read a whole book (!!!), gather some friends, and try to play some game they've never heard of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Xarcell" title="Xarcell"><img alt="Xarcell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Xarcell">Xarcell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433062/#Comment_433062" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-27T10:30:30+00:00" title="May 27, 2014 10:30AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks all.<br/><br/>I think there is a misunderstanding here though. The Player's Handbook &amp; GM's guide are both finished. The game is playable as is. Making it look good, is another story. Currently the player's handbook is over 200 pages, and is all charts &amp; formulas. Right now, it basically reads like an instruction manual which isn't appeasing. I'm at that point where I need to do the layout and add a few more subtle explanations. Hence why I wonder if I should be using Publisher or Scribus.<br/><br/>I have self-published before, so this isn't my first book. I can say that I do need to play I reckon, but finding the time to do so with people is hard. Although, I do play MUD games and MMOs/RPG/Strategy games. I just haven't played table-top games in 20 years. I've been mentioning it to local friends for years now, and they would rather play a MMO/Strategy video game. <br/><br/>I'm married with children with a 24/7 job. I do web hosting which is a pain, it's a 24/7 job. Then I also do photography and web design on freelance. I have to turn down half the offers I get because I cannot squeeze them in within 90 days. My wife works, so I'm the full time dad/home maker(2 kids). I can't take this kind of commitment lightly.<br/><br/>So after listening to everyone here, I guess my best route would be to build the site again, and find some people that are willing to play-test it for me. I'll start putting everything online to start building a community to get feedback, but it will be at least 60-70 days before I can even start on the website. If possible, I would like to provide the game for free, but get funds elsewhere to keep maintenance. If I made no income on it at all, my wife would kill me. :P<br/><br/>I guess my first hurdle would be to decide on a publishing platform. Second would be slap my friends around until they are willing to try it with me. I know once they do though, they'll be hooked. Then starting building the site which will need a blog, forum, and a downloads manager. Possibly an online store. Then open up testing publicly to 100 GM's or so?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433071/#Comment_433071" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-27T12:47:38+00:00" title="May 27, 2014 12:47PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know Draven, a friend of mine was recently in a similar situation: he has this great business idea (not "great business idea" in the sense of a barstool brainstorm - he's a veteran small businessman, so it really was good) that he's been developing part-time for a couple of years, and now it has product and clients, and it needs his full-time commitment to make it actually fly as a real growth business. However, he's also like 40 years old with two kids, a house mortgage and a very well-paying white-collar freelancer job. So he was in a difficult position, having to choose between doing boring yet well-paying consult programming indefinitely to support his family, or risking their financial security to see what his side-business might achieve.<br/><br/>You're in sort of a similar life situation here, except that your side business has no chance in hell of ever turning a profit. (For the purposes of family man fiscal responsibility I'm defining "profit" here as any money left over after you pay yourself minimum wage for time expended.) This is very important, as even making your game pay for a website may be more difficult than you might expect. It's not the most difficult thing in the world to make $200 a year with a roleplaying game, but the people who actually manage to do even that have a pretty specific combination of hobby history, skill-set and passion on their side. Also, doing it is generally speaking their primary hobby. Some have families, many are sub-30 young men enjoying a culture hobby as part of their single lifestyle.<br/><br/>(For the sake of general curiousity: my friend chose to take a significant loan against his personal assets to maintain his family for a few months while he works to build his business. Risky, but that's the sort of thing you have to do on occasion to achieve things.)<br/><br/>What all this means is that you should definitely look into publishing your game as strictly a hobby proposition. That means moving slowly, making the process itself fun, and not worrying too much about the results. Definitely don't put any money into it, nor any time that is not strictly hobby time. You have responsibilities that frankly limit you from the sort of bohemian insanity that some of us engage in.\n<blockquote>So after listening to everyone here, I guess my best route would be to build the site again, and find some people that are willing to play-test it for me.

Here's what you should be doing:\n<ol><li>Put the rules text you have up in the 'net somewhere. Doesn't matter where, put it in Dropbox or a Wordpress blog site or Google Docs or whatever.

You're too early to be worrying about that.<br/><br/>When you have a finished manuscript that you want to turn into a book (note that this is not a mandatory thing - you could publish as e.g. a website instead), you'll want to have it run through a process of layout. For this you either get somebody else to do it, or you learn how to do the layout yourself. If you choose the latter, you need to choose the software you'll use to do it.<br/><br/>I should note that a common mistake is to use a word processor such as Microsoft Word at this juncture, perhaps because people in corporate environments often create little memos and such in Word. It is not impossible to make a nice book with Word, but it is an up-hill battle that requires expertise. Unfortunately, the person most likely to use a word processor to do layout is very likely one who doesn't have much expertise with either layout or office software. I would advice forgetting this route and instead opting for a dedicated layout software.<br/><br/>A common suggestion in this regard is to use Scribus, but that's mostly because it's free - Scribus is not very good, frankly. If you can hack the programming, I suspect that some variation of LaTeX (Lynx, for example) might serve better. Scribus will accomplish a book, but it'll be through tears.<br/><br/>The ideal choice would be Adobe InDesign, which is likely the best software for the purpose on the market right now. However, it is quite expensive. An interesting hack for experienced users would be to install the 30 day free demo and do the layout before the time runs out  <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> Of course piracy and student licenses and such are also options.<br/><br/>(Another similarly priced product of similar quality would be Quark XPress. The points that apply to InDesign apply to that as well, except that Quark's not as well known and popular among the small press hipster crowd.)<br/><br/>I suspect that the best choice for a newbie book designer at this point is to pay for an affordable semi-professional software - there are a few options that people tend to recommend when the matter comes up. Such a software might cost e.g. $50, and apparently they do the job well enough when it comes to a simple book design. I can't recommend any specific softwares myself, as I haven't tried these out, but I'm sure you'll find some suggestions if you want to find out more. There's a thread on this forum every year or so about the subject, the various options are discussed in those pretty thoroughly.<br/><br/>I should note that I haven't used Microsoft Publisher myself, so can't compare it to Scribus and InDesign/QuarkXPress (with which I am personally familiar). People tend to put it down, though, so it's difficult to say whether it's a better choice than Scribus. I have difficulty imagining that it would be worse, though, so if I had to pick one of those, I'd go with Publisher <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433073/#Comment_433073" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-27T13:09:19+00:00" title="May 27, 2014  1:09PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I should note that the idea of getting a hundred GMs to participate in an open playtest is so beyond the pale that I don't know how to break it to you [...]<br/></blockquote>\nThat jumped out at me too. I'm not sure ANY indie RPG has ever accomplished this kind of playtesting success (and if one has - perhaps Burning Wheel? - it was due to years and years of networking, riding on the success of other previously published games, and an established reputation and fan base).<br/><br/>There are just too many of them out there. <br/><br/>I'll reiterate what I said earlier: you're fighting a significant uphill battle if your "basic book" is 200 pages. Look at it this way: I'm also a game designer. I'll send you a link to a website where you can register and download a 200-page game I'm writing, which you currently know nothing about. How long with it take you to find time to read it, with nothing offered in return?<br/><br/>You can much better gauge interest in your project if you can put out some small samples and see what kind of response they draw; then at least you'll have a sense of whether people are curious about your project or it will fall on deaf ears immediately.<br/><br/>The OSR community is really fond of random tables for stuff, and occasionally even publishes compendia of such. You might try sharing some of the more interesting ones somewhere on the net and see if they draw a positive response.

I usually buy software with payments that I receive, because my month-to-month income is unstable. I dislike the idea that if I want the new stuff, I gotta pay $50 a month. I want to reduce my monthly bills, not increase them. Thus, the Adobe boycott. Now I feel maybe I should re-install it because I have no better options. I also dislike that Adobe is not for Linux users, as I'm a firm believer in free open-source software and want to support Ubuntu.<br/><br/>I was interested in Scribus because it works for Windows &amp; Ubuntu, and I could go ahead and be getting used to it until I switch to Ubuntu. However, I realized Scribus has a steep learning curve.<br/><br/>Others have suggested that I try Publisher, but I don't have Office for my desktop. Only for my Surface RT, which has everything except Publisher. It's also been suggested that I get Office 365 because it includes Publisher, but then my Surface doesn't Support Office 365.

Fortunately there's no reason not to stick with older versions of the software until something competitive comes along. Who knows, maybe Scribus improves sufficiently at some point to make me switch to that. It has been improving steadily over the years, if slowly!<br/><br/>Layout solutions for Linux are limited, though. It might be the case that you'll have to go with either Scribus or LaTeX. The idea of laying out a full-size book in Scribus horrifies, though - the lack of multicore processor support alone makes it an extreme pain in the ass to use for anything over ten pages in length. LaTeX, on the other hand, is apparently a bit of a chore to use for the kind of magazine-like layouts that rpg books usually use.<br/><br/>I should note that the learning curve with Scribus is <i>not</i> any worse than any other layout software - it's bad for reasons unrelated to that. The fact of the matter is that layout is a discipline of its own, so it's good to reserve some time for learning the basics if you plan to do your own book design.<br/><br/>The most realistic choice would probably be to run a Windows box or Wine or something, and get a Windows-based software.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Xarcell" title="Xarcell"><img alt="Xarcell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Xarcell">Xarcell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433077/#Comment_433077" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-27T14:16:39+00:00" title="May 27, 2014  2:16PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are programs that convert HTML pages to PDF.

You've successfully boycotted them. I'd say that if you're looking to do serious layout, the advantage of spending your time learning InDesign is absolutely huge (and a lot of people still work in CS5 (a bunch prefer it to CS6)). If you're spending your time learning Publisher or Corel Draw or Quark, then you are losing the "oh, I'm learning a really valuable skill" benefit. Even if you never publish your game, if you become pretty good at Indesign CS5, you've got something valuable and transferrable out of this (Indesign CC is pretty similar in terms of interface).<br/><br/>Also, just to sort of reiterate other people's points: stop thinking about layout and just start playing. Whether it's your own stuff, or whether it's other people's stuff (and it REALLY should be both of those), worrying about layout or server costs for a huge roleplaying game without actually playing roleplaying games is such a weird thing to me. People who are doing a playtest understand that the layout is not there. The core is: "is your game fun? do the rules help or hinder the experience?" <br/><br/>But, if that does not work as an argument, as I worry it might not, then maybe a more practical concern: every game goes through such massive revision of mechanics, gets huge amount of feedback (even from just one group), that spending time on layout before you have feedback on what is important, what works, what is informationally clear and what is not is just wasting time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433113/#Comment_433113" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-28T08:16:06+00:00" title="May 28, 2014  8:16AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding the skill-set argument, the skills used with Scribus or Quark at least are about 85% transferrable to InDesign; I myself moved to InDesign from QuarkXPress last decade, and found no difficulty in adapting. I agree with James that layout is a valuable skill, and should be a default part of any culture industry freelancer's skill-set, whether they come from an editorial or graphic design direction.<br/><br/>I haven't used Corel Draw seriously - I understand that it's a vector art software similar to e.g. Inkscape and Illustrator. Regarding the latter, Inkscape is much nicer, but Illustrator has more tools (and it's occasionally technically more reliable for demanding work), so I end up using Illustrator too often. I should emphasize that the praise we heap upon InDesign should not apply to Illustrator, despite them being part of the same software package; Illustrator is a very, very mediocre software and I don't wonder at all if anybody opts to use e.g. Inkscape instead. The relationship of the free vs. corporate software is reversed in the vector arts field vs. the layout field, for some curious reason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433128/#Comment_433128" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-28T08:57:30+00:00" title="May 28, 2014  8:57AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, good point Eero, I'd agree that all the serious design programs do transfer knowledge, since it's largely about the techniques you can use to make a design consistent, editable, and repeatable.

The more work you've done on laying out the game, the harder it is to make yourself make the changes that a playtest throws up. It can be tempting to rationalise away feedback that playtesters give you so you don't have to implement it, and the more effort the rework requires, the more tempting it becomes to decide not to do it.

I used other programs like: Sketch, PixLR, ZED, and Cloud9 IDE as my main tools. MS Word Online and Google Doc's both have their shortcomings, but their spreadsheets are awesome. ATM I use ZED, Inkscape, RawTherapee, LibreOffice and installing Codiad on my server as we speak. I have found no substitute for Photoshop. People keep telling me GIMP is the best alternative, but I'm just not seeing it. Bare in mind, I'm trying to switch to tools that are also Ubuntu compatible.<br/><br/>Why would HTML to PDF pose issues with Typography? I was thinking today that I could create the HTML pages to look exactly how I want the book pages to look for converting to PDF(printing), but at the same time I could make the same pages responsive for optimal browser reading. I'm about 99% sure this can be done, but I don't know what kind of issues I haven't thought of yet I may run into.<br/><br/>I try my best not to have barriers, but I spoke with my friend 2 days ago and convinced him to playtest my game. It took 3 hours to convince him, and I did that by GM'ing over the phone for half hour. Once he got the general idea of what players &amp; GM's do, he's eager to try it out. Now it's a matter of scheduling, as I'm first shift and he is third shift. FYI, he's volunteered to get more people to playtest with us, but I just wish I could playtest it privately with experienced players, not greenhorns.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Xarcell" title="Xarcell"><img alt="Xarcell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Xarcell">Xarcell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433226/#Comment_433226" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-30T19:36:14+00:00" title="May 30, 2014  7:36PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had an idea, but I'm unsure if it is a good one.

If that software has high-quality typesetting features, then the typesetting will be of high quality. However, this is practically speaking very rare in this kind of software. What's worse, it is unlikely that the software will allow the designer much control over the text flow, so they can't do manual corrections to the typesetting of the pdf.<br/><br/>As for whether one is bothered by the kind of quality loss this kind of process represents (mis-hyphenation, unoptimal linebreaking, word gaps, kerning issues, etc.), that'd likely depend on the purpose of the file and one's expectations. For me this level of quality - comparable to what you'd get by doing layout in e.g. Word - would be fine for a free guerrilla product, while completely unacceptable for a quality product. It's the difference between professional and amateur quality, pretty much.\n<blockquote>I had an idea, but I'm unsure if it is a good one. The game I made is more of a engine than anything.

I've some experience with publishing under similar arrangements, and I would advice you to focus on making your own game spectacular first, and worry about licensing second. I would particularly recommend a healthily critical attitude about game systems without solid creative impetus embedded. The history of rpg publishing knows of very few purely system-based products that have captured imaginations; games that combine an innovative system with an exciting setting seem to find artistic and commercial success easier.<br/><br/>For examples of games that have been published under this type of arrangement, consider the 3rd edition of D&amp;D, FATE, Sorcerer, the aforementioned Shadow of Yesterday and Savage Worlds. There are of course many more, those just come to mind as prominent successes in third-party production via licenses.<br/><br/>Note that looking at historical examples, royalties for the use of the system are practically unknown; the only big example that comes to mind is Delta Green, really - I assume that they made some sort of commercial arrangement with Chaosium, anyway. Were I you, I would not get my hopes up - the idea of making any money in royalties is in the same pipe dream category with attracting a hundred playtest groups, getting plagiarized, starting a game-specific web forum community and writing a roleplaying game without rigorous active play in the background of the process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433230/#Comment_433230" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-30T21:43:12+00:00" title="May 30, 2014  9:43PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero is being really helpful to you but too nice.  I'm going to be the mean lawyer man here. Such is my burden.<br/><br/>The very idea that you even entertained the thought you could get 100 GMs to do your playtesting, is rock solid proof that you absolutely should not spend even one thin dime or ten more seconds on this project right now. You literally put a figure out there that was <i>two orders of magnitude off</i> - like if I went to my local Lexus dealership and said "I'd like a 2014 GS, here's my most lavish offer: $500", or, worse, "Here's my cashier's check for $5 million."<br/><br/>Don't worry - just like me and my Lexus trip - there's things you can do to educate yourself:<br/><br/>* Play a wide variety of RPGs, both as GM and as player - and play games with different GM roles, including roleplaying games with no GMs.<br/>* Attend a lot of RPG conventions, there are often good speakers and panels there addressing these questions, and fucking <i>count heads</i>.<br/>* View Steve Jackson Games, Evil Hat, and Vincent Baker's yearly financial breakdowns.<br/>* Read a wide variety of RPGs. I don't mean skim them, I mean really read every word on every page and sit down with a calculator and run the numbers of the RPG, and make notes on how it's presented and what works and what doesn't. Read it at least as intently as you did your book reports in the 9th grade when you were diligent and trying to impress that English teacher you had a crush on.<br/>* Get yourself in contact with a wide variety of RPG designers and see if they'll share some broad figures about their enterprises. Don't launch in on your situation, ask them questions about theirs.<br/><br/>But under no other circumstances do anything more <i>with this project</i> beyond enjoying it with your own groups and your own community until you do these things and more. Your work is already at the point where it can do maximum benefit, and it will cost you nothing to keep it there while you learn more about whether you wish to go further.  Right now it's fun for you and your group, and those you personally share it with. This is the soul of virtue, don't think that it isn't valued, don't think that it isn't worth anything, it is.<br/><br/>But both your life and the money you'll have to spend in it are finite and limited. You are contemplating throwing some into the empty void of nothingness and thinking, "well, it's not so much, and it might hit something!"

I'm read almost all of the forgotten realms books. I play just about every single RPG game that comes across the Xbox. My favorite being "Skyrim". I spent 3 years being addicted to Gemstone III MUD game and I stopped playing it when they changed the mechanics and dubbed it Gemstone IV. I also owned a traditional RPG forum for 2 years. I am not in anyway new to the RPG world. I am sub-par to the tabletop subject of it though.<br/><br/>I think I can do everything that needs to be done on my own, except play all these different RPG's. I do not have the time or the money to spend on it. I guess this is the most important aspect of my situation and I'm already admitting failure. So your right, unless I have do everything in my spare time, without spending any money, then there is no point.<br/><br/>I've gotten nothing but good advice here(finally) compared to other forums over the years. I reckon at this point I should just shut up about it until I have material available for people to playtest.<br/><br/>Thanks again everyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433240/#Comment_433240" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-31T10:39:43+00:00" title="May 31, 2014 10:39AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can play a bunch of RPGs without spending a lot of money on it, you just have to hook up with your local community and start meeting people!

If you're hoping for financial success, his advice is EXACTLY right.<br/><br/>If your goals are different, the situation might not be that grim. It's pretty weird, after all, for a bunch of strangers on the internet to shoot down some person's dreams, without even knowing what they have to offer!<br/><br/>The reason much of the responses are very skeptical is because every once in a while an unknown "designer" pops up who has been "working on his game system for the last XX years in solitude" and makes grand claims about how amazing his game is. Without fail (at least I can't think of any exceptions to this), their games are horrible and have a very very limited vision, often largely due to an apparent total lack of knowledge about what other games are out there. So there's a bit of a knee-jerk reaction to this kind of thing now: "Oh, another one of those..."<br/><br/>Just because this is a trend doesn't mean that you might not be an exception to the rule, however. I believe (but I could be wrong, I don't know the full story) that Vincent Baker showed up at the Forge just over a decade ago with a game called "kill puppies for satan", without any previous experience as a designer or much internet presence. While the game itself wasn't a huge financial success, it certainly got him noticed, and since then he has become one of the most renowned designers in the "story games" scene.<br/><br/>If your goal is something other than financial success, however - perhaps you simply want to make the best game you can make, or have fun playing a game of your own design with your friends, or release a top-notch free product, or put something out there just to establish a name for yourself - there's no reason to fold and drop your dreams. Go for it!<br/><br/>I think the reason JDCorley (and however many others) are being "tough" with you is because they don't want to see you fail. <br/><br/>It wouldn't do to advise someone to put a ton of money and work into a product and then have them meet with disappointment (which is the most likely outcome, at least statistically), often after having wasted incredible amounts of time, effort, and money on their darling game. They're trying to help you avoid that kind of trouble.<br/><br/>So I'd like to encourage you to read all this with a positive eye:<br/><br/>This is not an admonishment to stop dreaming and striving for something you believe in. Rather, it is people with experience trying to help you move along that path without repeating the mistakes of others: in other words, advising you in ways that will make you MORE likely to succeed.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" title="Paul_D_L"><img alt="Paul_D_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L">Paul_D_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433254/#Comment_433254" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-31T21:39:57+00:00" title="May 31, 2014  9:39PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The direction this thread has taken is a little odd to me. Eero has given fantastic, friendly advice; but, I agree with several people here: the bottom line is that you need to play and see how the hobby has evolved. I don't think that means you should just give up. But it means don't put the cart before the horse. All that time you've spent on your game can, eventually, produce something good. But it won't produce anything good unless you have much more first-hand knowledge of what other people have done and what you CAN do.<br/><br/>I think that's the big takeaway, here: people are encouraging you to play games that have popped up in the meantime because if all you want to do is replicate or respond to D&amp;D and its genetic brothers with very little play experience for a decade, you're selling yourself and all the work you've done short. Those games already exist and have for at least that decade span. There's more out there.<br/>Put yourself in a position to excel and produce something people will actually care about. The idea that people will steal your mechanic is wishful thinking at best and likely just absurd. That doesn't mean you are foolish or you've wasted your time, but really embrace what Eero is telling you: ideas are a dime a dozen. Execution and refinement is the core of something good and you don't get any of that until you have playtested your game EXTENSIVELY.<br/><br/>So, keep working at it, but do so with context of what you're up to. Forget the idea that what you have is worth stealing. Think of the kind of advice you'd give a friend:<br/>Friend: "I wrote this awesome tabletop RPG system and I'm ready to publish!"<br/>You: "Oh, I didn't know you played tabletop RPG's."<br/>Friend: "I haven't for a decade."<br/>You: "But that's the most recent quarter of the lifespan of the entire hobby. The internet really shoves these things along; how much has changed since you last played?"<br/>Friend: "I have no idea except what I've heard about and some video games."<br/>You: "It's pretty likely your ideas have been done before in many forms. If you're legitimately interested in publishing a tabletop RPG, you should at least get into the current version of the hobby for a while and give yourself some context."<br/><br/>If you ultimately decide that your job and family prevent you from doing that, that's legitimate and honorable - just tuck the game into your pocket and bring it out when circumstances change. But if you have time to write so many pages, you just might be able to find time to play and explore all of the new things you haven't seen. It's a matter of prioritizing which part of the process you value. It seems like people here are just trying to tell you to reconsider those values and, for the most part, the discussion is getting redirected into questions of Corel Draw vs. InDesign. The reality is that those are afterthoughts for where you are in the process. I say pursue it, just accept that what you've done so far can be placed on the back burner for now, while you truly orient yourself in the hobby and experience things first-hand.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433256/#Comment_433256" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-01T12:13:58+00:00" title="June  1, 2014 12:13PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's actually a big part of the game that is never explained in the rules, though some parts of it are shown on the actual play examples. It's what we call Techniques, which are the unspoken rules of the game that define the fuzzy bundaries of the social contract. Today most people still learn them by playing with experienced GMs and groups, by reading anecdotes, actual play reports and examples and/or reinvent them by their own using techniques from other games or mostly, from other sources of experience as acting, applied social psychology and such.<br/><br/>Yet lately games include a few of these as integral part of the game, like AW's principles. If you haven't played enough, you're probably missing a lot of these unspoken rules and/or thinking that everyone plays the game in the same way that you do, either if you use less techniques and solve game issues with mechanics or if you use more techniques or simply, ones that aren't actually as familiar to the big audience as you think.<br/><br/>Check <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18646/techniques-do-we-have-a-list-of-them#Item_1" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> for a list of them. You'll find a lot of them sound obvious, some others will be possibly completely new to you and yet others would look strange and maybe only suitable to specific games. The thing they have in common is that you will barely find any reference on how to use them in any trad game and yet you will recognize  them as the building blocks of tabletop RPG language.<br/><br/>Play your game and let us play it, there's a whole new world in your mind that we would like to explore, and another whole world in ours that you'll find really fun to see.

It's certainly something I should dive pretty deep into and spend some serious time researching to get up to deep.

Some of us would like to play your game, and all of us want to read it.  There's probably about 200 years worth of collective professional and semi-professional game design experience speaking to you on this page.  Some of us are sorry if it hurts to hear.  Some of us are not.<br/><br/>We play rough, because we want to show you how the world really works.  (And also because, as your siblings, we have a familial imperative to bust your balls a little bit.  This is especially true if you exhibit traits like hubris, bikeshedding, litigiousness, defensiveness, or a lack of adequate research.)  Ultimately, we would love for you to succeed; but you have to earn it.<br/><br/>Don't take this too literally, but do take it:<br/><a href="http://rivetgeek.blogspot.com/2013/10/necessary-selling-points-for_18.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://rivetgeek.blogspot.com/2013/10/necessary-selling-points-for_18.html</a><br/><br/>If the information in this conversation only flows in one direction (from us to you), you won't hear many positive-sounding evaluations because you haven't given us much to base such statements on.  If the information we provide sounds generic or off the mark to you, it's probably because there isn't much in your description to indicate to us what makes your game stand apart from other games we know.  <br/><br/>To be truthful, we don't know "if it's worth it" for you to finish your game, because we really don't know anything substantial about your game.  However, many important facts have been established, among them: (1) you need to play more TTRPGs including your own, (2) skill-based leveling is not new, (3) page layout is a cart not a horse, (4) don't expect to make much money, and (5) advice about secrecy is just lawyers being lawyers.<br/><br/>You also probably already know (if you think about it for two minutes) how radically and completely different implementing a paper system is from implementing a software system.  If they weren't completely different media with very few requirements in common as a matter of fact, you would find that <i>most</i> TTRPGs would possess online versions.  In fact, <i>almost none of them do</i>.  Ask yourself why.<br/><br/>Lemme tell you a long story.<br/><br/>I wrote 2 game systems and 5 adventure modules for Iron Crown back in the 80s and 90s.  Some of these oldschool relics are still selling in PDF format through a deal with Guild Companion, so my "professional" status is secure.  But there was no way I could have supported my family on the money I made from my games, even back then: I would have had to write two or three 64-page books a month.  And mind you, this was back when the US dollar was strong and the economy was doing fine.  There was a lot of angel money floating around in the 80s and 90s.  You could fund experimental projects that would never make it out the gate today, and I took full advantage of it.  So my professional activities shifted, first into interactive theater and LARPs (1 step away from RPGs), then into software game design and narrative engineering (2 steps), then into web-based "virtual world" environments (3 steps).  Then the dotcom crash happened.  Friends who were worth millions became penniless overnight, the angel money dried up, and companies weren't rushing to spend big money on things like virtual worlds anymore.  Like you, I became a webhost.  I worked a lot more and played a lot less, eventually losing track of the TTRPG industry's cutting edge.  I also became a programmer, and drifted yet another step away from my RPG career.  I did what it took to feed my kids.  Fifteen years passed.<br/><br/>Last year I re-entered the scene, armed with new game projects and ideas sprung from the mental co-mingling of all my design experiences in various media, along with a liberal bundle of new skills, from project management to technical writing.  I thought I was more than adequately prepared, the prodigal son returns, etc.  But I discovered that a revolution had occurred while my back was turned.  Among other developments, there was something called "Storygames".  There was this place called <i>The Forge</i>, there was this game called <i>Apocalypse World</i>, there was this whole new meta-genre of <i>Narrativist Games</i> which stood alongside (or sometimes opposed) the crunchy mechanics of the systems I would have recognized as RPGs on first glance.  There was something called the "OSR".  Everything had changed.  But one of the biggest changes was the game design community itself: see, when I designed all my games the first time around, there was no web.  There was no "game design community" at all, outside of cons.  I had a lot to catch up on.  Thankfully, it was all archived and searchable.<br/><br/>It took months of reading and playing to develop the nerve to open an account here.  It took the encouragement of <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> (the nicest guy on SG) to post my first small experimental playtest here ("Watch the World Die").  That thread has only a few participants, and it moves at a slow pace.  That felt discouraging.  I felt like a total newb all over again.  But meanwhile I continued posting, helping when I could, contributing to other peoples' projects and making new friends.  I started an open-source game project with <a href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">@Potemkin</a> right here on SG ("DayTrippers"), I started posting on other RPG-related forums as well, I got familiar with Google+ and started getting involved in games online, in addition to tracking down players and starting two weekly gaming groups for face-to-face play and playtesting.  After a while, enough people had downloaded WTWD to where they started talking about it a little bit.  I got a couple good reviews and some AP podcasters decided to play it on YouTube.  Now it's been downloaded over 500 times, which is quite awesome, and feels somewhat vindicating.<br/><br/>But even after all those experiences, I am not qualified to challenge a single word of the advice given by my siblings above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Xarcell" title="Xarcell"><img alt="Xarcell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Xarcell">Xarcell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433336/#Comment_433336" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-03T19:58:25+00:00" title="June  3, 2014  7:58PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for sharing.<br/><br/>I think at this point it would be best for me get some material to show before rapping on any further about the project.

Like, that's the kind of move you make when you've done this for five years, and by this I mean publishing your game. The kind of store you picture here makes sense when you have thousands of sales and hundreds of players at a minimum; any less than that, and both you and your third-party support are better off with less formal and commercially oriented solutions.<br/><br/>Think about it: you spend 200 hours right now developing the most amazing website ever, and then have five people as users, one of which is your mom and the rest are a pity party originating here at SG. Did that make any sense, when you could've instead used that time to play, write and network? To me it doesn't, you're just creating digital real estate with no real use, and granting your project a distinct sense of failure when people see your huge edifice of a website with none of the signs of real popularity.<br/><br/>A website community strategy doesn't make sense before you have like at least a minimum of a dozen people who are long-term interested enough about your game to hang at your forum (or better, Google group or some such - forums are outdated for minor social needs such as this) weekly and chat things up for at least a year or two, providing constant community action for newcomers to latch on to. At that point it may start making sense to consider doing things like website services related to your game, because you actually have some people playing it regularly. Before then you're just wasting your time, insofar as the social dynamics of guerrilla marketing go.<br/><br/>Blogger + Google Drive is an excellent first stage technical solution. If it's good enough for game designers who have had two or even three magnitudes more success than you have (just look at what people with that level of success do; heck, look at my website, I've got 2-3 magnitudes on you at the moment), then surely you can also try it out, considering the low up-front expense. It's always easy to upgrade into a more committed web presence later; at this point planning for an over-reaching solution is about gratifying the ego and avoiding the actual rpg design/publishing work more than any practical need. (This is a familiar phenomenon, by the way - some people really want to create a web community and not so much a game, so they mess about with the community aspects of their publishing plan instead of the actual core concern. Such would likely be served better by partnering up with some existing publisher as a webmaster, as in that role they could directly contribute to community services for a product and community that needs those.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433344/#Comment_433344" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-03T21:38:31+00:00" title="June  3, 2014  9:38PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero is exactly right. <br/><br/>One succinct way of putting this:<br/><br/>Q: When do you need to develop infrastructure like online forums, stores, marketing, agents, publicity, etc?<br/><br/>A: When other people start asking you to, or because it's going to save you time you don't have right now.<br/><br/>To do otherwise is like an amateur actor with no experience hiring an agent.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433347/#Comment_433347" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-03T21:48:20+00:00" title="June  3, 2014  9:48PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pretty soon the internet will be over anyway and we'll just be downloading apps to our phones for everything.<br/><br/><img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Xarcell" title="Xarcell"><img alt="Xarcell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Xarcell">Xarcell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433365/#Comment_433365" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-04T06:37:32+00:00" title="June  4, 2014  6:37AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Eero is exactly right. <br/>To do otherwise is like an amateur actor with no experience hiring an agent.<br/></blockquote>\nSo very true.<br/><br/>When I add the store, it will be in a sub-domain. I do not intend to sync everything like most people do. Same goes for the forums, if or when I add the forums, they will go in a separate sub-domain. This way I can add on without having to rebuild anything.<br/><br/>Marketing isn't something I plan to spend alot of time or money on. If no one tries it, then no one tries it. Yeah I may spend 200 hours on building the the site, but other the annual domain costs it won't not really be costing me anything.<br/><br/>BTW, the store will not be restricting material to just my game. It will be a open TTRPG resource. Kinda like <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.rpgnow.com/</a> , except it will look a thousand times better.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433366/#Comment_433366" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-04T08:19:37+00:00" title="June  4, 2014  8:19AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2014 9:34AM by WarriorMonk.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, why not try to use a website like RPGnow or another that already has traffic to show your game to another people, instead of trying to build a fanbase from zero and make them visit your website? Believe me, no amount of work on the visuals is actually enough to make people buy things. I'm a professional designer with 16 years of experience on the market and from my experience and from those of my partners I can assure you: The best visuals can make the message clear and even catch the viewer's attention out from nowhere; the best interface can facilitate quickly all the information the buyer may need and all that BUT that doesn't mean they will buy your product.<br/><br/>Analyzing all you have said about your product I notice several mistakes on your sales pitch, on the top that you still haven't told us the most important thing for us all as both designers and players: What is the gameplay like? Really, telling us that it's<i> similar to D&amp;D</i> evokes all kind of bad memories, both from bad experiences with D&amp;D and from bad experiences with games that in the end were so <i>similar to D&amp;D</i> that kept making the same mistakes D&amp;D had made in this or that edition. Everyone, correct me if I'm wrong but I believe it was Ron Edwards who coined the term "fantasy heartbreaker" for such games at the Forge? Because there were soooo many novice game designers trying to build the <i>next D&amp;D</i> (heh, it kinds sounds ironic now) the term become quite common on those days.<br/><br/>Not that it has stopped people from creating fantasy heartbreakers anyway, though lately most of us keep these design for our own personal use. There have even been some more or less successful cases but all of them were from people who have been active in the community for years before daring to post them. Most started just posting a pfd on their blog and getting pople interested at conventions. <br/><br/>Basically it's the same system for anything you want to launch on the web: First you need to get familiar with three or four different comunities interested in your product, learn what they like and how to present it, what they have tried and tested and what they hate or worse, don't care about. Then you'll doublecheck your design or even throw it away, or put it out there for free and convince the leaders of the communities and bloggers to check it or even playtest it (which is easier to do at conventions). If it's good they will spread the word by themselves and only then you will have people interested in buying a full version of your game with complete features and web support, and dare to create a community yourself, for which you'll need plenty of spare time to do the management.<br/><br/>And only then it will produce a little bit of money, probably the amount of money you have in mind or even less.<br/><br/>So you see, this is actually a labour of love; there's no way to get too far without investing time, going to cons, meeting people in person and playing the game with them. Take it from me, I'm more or less in your position: I have no way of going to conventions and playtest my designs with people there. My work and personal life gets in the way of doing more. The most I've been able to do so far is keep participating in this community (I haven't tried another forums since the Forge but I'm okey with it, I feel quite comfortable here), I've tried the<a href="http://game-chef.com/" rel="nofollow"> Game Chef</a> twice now and I have a <a href="http://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">blog </a>with a single game finished and a couple tools for other games.<br/><br/>After 3 years in the community, this is as far as I've got. I haven't received a penny for my game and I've barely interested a few people on my designs or game tools. I'm okey with that for now since selling it wasn't my goal, so I really haven't tried. But really trying would definitely need to include travelling to USA (I'm in Peru) going to a con and finally meeting someone from the SG forum in person. I could still sell games trough my blog with some improvements or perhaps just a link to the proper pages, definitely web-design won't be crucial, but interacting with the different RPG communities in person will.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it has to be the same for you, but ask for the experience of the more ore less successful designers around, I'm probably not so far from the truth.<br/><br/>Edit: Also, you may want to check<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18733/we-know-so-little-of-our-hobby#Item_135" rel="nofollow"> this post from Rickard</a>, the second paragraph has something that explains exactly why your pitch hasn't made us to jump at saying "do it exactly as you think because you definitely have a winner there!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433392/#Comment_433392" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-04T19:18:44+00:00" title="June  4, 2014  7:18PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nah, D&amp;D is a really good game and saying it's "like D&amp;D" tells me a lot about the game, and I feel positively about it as a result.

and saying it's "like D&amp;D" tells me a lot about the game, and I feel positively about it as a result. Most gamers will!<br/><br/>Buuuut, a skill-levelling system is kind of not like D&amp;D, so I don't know what to think.</blockquote>\nD&amp;D is very good at what it does, I agree there. But I, personally, don't feel positive when someone says their game is like D&amp;D or is an improvement on/reaction to D&amp;D. First, if it's like D&amp;D, why wouldn't I just play D&amp;D? Just slapping independently advancing skills, for example, on a game that otherwise plays like D&amp;D is just okay, but nothing special. Not that every game has to be unique, but I fully understand and at least somewhat agree with an iffy reaction there.<br/><br/>There are several games that have come out just in the past few years that provide me with fascinating interpretations of what I've experienced with D&amp;D. Not even including OSR, there's Dungeon World, Torchbearer, and trivially skinning Marvel Heroic characters with a swords &amp; sorcery theme, just off the top of my head. So D&amp;D through some filter is a fine way to go. But without some context about what that filter is, there's no reason to feel positive about the theoretical game even if there might be reason to feel positive about the designer's passion, resources, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433397/#Comment_433397" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-04T20:43:08+00:00" title="June  4, 2014  8:43PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2014 8:43PM by Coalhada.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would not discount the sheer amount of exposure you get from RPGNow and its affiliated sites, if you want people to see your game.

What is your business plan?</blockquote>\n<b>1.|</b> I can't really say since I haven't played Savage Worlds or Pathfinder. All I can say is that I game is "broad". It has race/creature size mechanics, town mechanics(players can build their own towns, shops, &amp; castles to manage), item breakage mechanics, spell creation mechanics, environment mechanics, weather mechanics, item creation mechanics(weapons, armor, tools, pottery, magical items, art, and alot more), army mechanics(players can battle armies on a mass scale, but yet take part with individual characters), profession guilds, artisan guilds, value &amp; description mechanics. That's all I can think of off the top of my head, but I'm sure I'm missing a few mechanics.<br/><br/>The thing I think is nice about it is that it's modular. You use the mechanics that you want based on GM &amp; player experience at the game. So it works well for beginners and the advanced. For example, there are 120 grandchild skills in all, but they are divided into categories and sub-categories. If keeping track of and leveling up all those skills are too cumbersome for the players, the GM could just have everyone skill track the sub-categories, or even just the categories for simplicity. <br/><br/>For example: you have 4 basic parent skills with one of them being "Exhibition skills", and that branching down into 3 child skills categories: "Magical Skills", "Martial Skills", and "Weapon Skills". Then that branching down into 10 "grandchild skills" with one of the weapon skills being "One-handed Edged Weapons". Now, depending on how much dept you want to go, you can exercise each grandchild skill, leveling up each grandchild skill. However, if that's too overwhelming, you could choose to just level up the child skill or just the parent skill. So, using one-handed edged weapons can level up your "one-handed edged weapons" skill, or the "Weapon Skills Category", or the "Exhibition Skill Category". If your a magic user, it's builds up "Elemental Casting Skill", or "Magical Skills Category", or "Exhibition Skill Category".<br/><br/>I know this is somewhat confusing and I hope I explained it well enough. It's really simple if someone shows it to you. Basically, the Depth of skill usage is optional, with each category skill number being the average of it's children. Choose how much depth you want for your campaign.<br/><br/>Same goes for other mechanics. For example, there are "specific" environment/weather/combat modifiers. You decide in your campaign if you want to use them or not. A player who is standing on a hill gets a bonus over his opponent, or being in a blizzard adds a negative modifiers to certain skills like foraging, or being flanked by an opponent gives your opponent an bonus over you.<br/><br/>I have a specific skill check formula, and whatever mechanics you want you use slides into the formula with ease.<br/><br/><b>2.|</b>  I would be happy with $100-$200 a month. Although I would be ecstatic if I was getting 8k-10k a year. Not just from the game alone, but the whole project/website. My business plan is only half complete.

What you're describing sounds like it would appeal to a certain brand of "trad gamer", but it's certainly not revolutionary. Countless games exist/have existed in that vein for decades. So it is not, on its own, a huge selling point. It's a rather old-fashioned approach to game design, so a lot of people will read that and think, "Hmmm, ok - well, I've seen that claim before. Next!"<br/><br/>However, I'm sure there are still people who will dig it. And, on the flipside, if you looked at some of the games linked to in this thread and found that your game compares favorably to them, that's a very good sign for you!<br/><br/>You probably won't find that description/those features to be a huge selling point in this community, but that doesn't mean there won't be any interest in the game at all, in other words.<br/><br/>2. A goal of making 100-200 a month from what you're describing sounds pretty reasonable. It would probably take you a while to work up to those kinds of numbers (people who to learn about your game/site, it has to develop a reputation, etc), but it's possible. However, that would be a huge and unusual success, as far as these things go: if your first game attracts that much interest and does that well, you will be one of the lucky few. (Very, very few.)<br/><br/>Good luck! Keep us informed on how things are going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433825/#Comment_433825" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-14T13:23:49+00:00" title="June 14, 2014  1:23PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that level of success is not unheard of but it's rare.<br/><br/>I especially think a game of the type you describe really benefits from LOTS of reading and playing the many, many, many similar games that exist. Some of them are great, some are terrible, some are great with a big whopping turd right in the middle of it, others are terrible, but a diamond of a mechanic or module shines through.  I am right in the target audience for this type of game - I fuckin' love a really good meaty, lots-of-mechanics game - but I have a lot of options for it right now, many of which are really good.<br/><br/>I definitely urge you to check out Burning Wheel and play it at least once, in my view it is the "indispensable game" for people attempting to make an all-encompassing game system experience like you are.  I actually don't like Burning Wheel as much as I do some other, less mathematically rigorous and systematically unified games, but as a lodestar I feel it's almost mandatory for the type of goals you have.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433839/#Comment_433839" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-14T23:02:57+00:00" title="June 14, 2014 11:02PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2014 11:07PM by Scrape.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wanna point something out: <i>everyone here is telling you to play more RPGs.</i> There's a reason for this. The market right now is just <i>flooded</i> with awesome, interesting, and focused games and if you want to stand out, you need to know what it is that yours does better than any other. Then you need to<i> find out if any real demand exists for that.</i> During this process, you will be networking and building fans, which is 100% all that matters for making a game successful. Play more games and see what's going on out there.<br/><br/>I also hear a sort of lackadaisical "it'll catch on or it won't" vibe coming out, but that's not fair to your game or yourself. The game will be made better with every new game you try, I guarantee it. You will learn about current trends and new developments (there have been a lot!) in the hobby and your game and its marketing will benefit. Your own game needs playtesting by real groups that aren't yours. You will find them by getting involved with other gamers. Don't worry about layout software. Don't be stuck with the idea that your game is "done" if it hasn't been playtested dozens and dozens of times. The majority of gamers probably <i>don't</i> want a super complex ultra-realistic system, and if they do then they probably<i> already </i>have a favorite. You will only win them away if you get out there and play. Again, I don't wanna discourage you. But I want you to hear what everyone is saying.<br/><br/>I promise you: playing more games is the first step here. Go play them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Xarcell" title="Xarcell"><img alt="Xarcell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Xarcell">Xarcell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433850/#Comment_433850" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-15T07:43:34+00:00" title="June 15, 2014  7:43AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2014 7:45AM by Xarcell.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Its at the point where beating me up about not playing other games isn't helpful. As I have already mentioned over and over playing all these other various games are not within my means.<br/><br/>I got my hands on Burning Wheel. Although I haven't played it, I find it to have an unnecessary complexity, and I think it's shallow in comparison to what I have created in terms of depth. The only I like thus far about Burning Wheel is how they laid out their pages.<br/><br/>After learning from you guys and looking at other game mechanics, I think my game will be one of those "love it or hate" type of games. I personally think mine is leaps and bounds better than anything else I've seen so far, but then again who doesn't think the game they created isn't the best?<br/><br/>I started on it's website which will offer some tools like name generators, town generators, etc. I'm just struggling with logo design ATM, because I can't make up my mind what I want.

I apologize for that, and if it seems like a pigpile then I'm sorry too. There's just no substitute to seeing rules in action, in real play, and seeing <b>not only how the math works but what behavior it elicits from the players</b>. That's what a game really is made of. If you can't play them, then reading as many games as possible is the next best thing. But you still don't get to see the<i> real</i> game: it's like reading a cake recipe instead of eating cake.<br/><br/>Also for reals: Burning Wheel is much-loved around here but it's considered <i>exceedingly</i> complex by most everyone. That density has been a big barrier for a lot of people (including me!) And only after having an experienced person run it for me did I finally Get It. It took Actual Play.<br/><br/>I'll say this: most gamers are not after perfect simulation rules. We did that for years and have mostly moved on. I wanna keep telling you to go out and run this game for people and take their feedback and see where the current gaming scene is at, but it seems like you're full-steam on designing this website with town name generators and stuff right now. So I guess I'm just gonna bow out and say I'm not the target audience for this game or this thread.

I think most people would glance at it an say "Yikes!" and then move on to the next game. As I mentioned in my first post, I was worried about it being "too much". Compared to other games, it's pretty big. It's waaaay easier to understand, but the game just cannot be played without the manual. Simply because there is no way anyone could remember that much information, even if they have been playing for 5 years; or unless they have a photographic memory. Then again, it is modular so your campaigns don't have to go into that much depth. So the depth is optional...<br/><br/>All I can do at this point is get it out to the public, and let players post feedback on it if they choose to play it. I'm going to use Google Drive, so I gotta re-type everything in Google Docs, because for some reason Google Docs will only show the first page if the handbook is in other formats. It would just greatly streamline things for me if it was on the cloud. I just wish Google Doc's supported colpsan in their tables, since every one of my tables(about 200 of them) use colspan. So I have to somehow come up with an alternative way to display my tables. FYI, tables make up about 80% of the manual.<br/><br/>There are no such things as Character Sheets. One piece of paper cannot hold all the information. Instead, we have Character Pamlets which span a dozen or so pages. I know that sounds unattractive, but actually it's quite the opposite. I started using Character Pamlets when I was playing D&amp;D and it grew on everyone rather quickly. We just buy those 30 cent folders, then put the character sheets in them, and add several sheets of printing paper, notebook paper, and graph paper. It just seems better that way instead of trying to cram everything onto one sheet of paper.<br/><br/>I'm unsure as to what to call the rule books though. Actually, there is only one rulebook, and that is all you need to play. However, there will also be a GM handbook, and Creature Handbook. At this point, I'm thinking of calling them: "Player Compendium", "Master Compendium", and the "Creature Compendium".

Not that character spec takes that much room, but a character stable (each player typically has like half a dozen characters scattered around the game world) adds up, and on occasion individual players end up being responsible for more complex project book-keeping.

If you can't get your (HTML-based?) manuscript converted for Google Docs, ask somebody more facile with text editing to help. I personally would simply publish the manuscript as say PDF or whatever, and if Google Docs can't distribute it (although not being able to display PDFs would be very strange), then there are other options.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433860/#Comment_433860" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-15T10:50:07+00:00" title="June 15, 2014 10:50AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2014 3:07PM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're breaking my heart, man.

Meanwhile my <i>game</i> system - a simulationist wet dream that I really wanted to make come true - was a huge and largely unnecessary learning curve for players, effectively standing in the way of giving them what THEY wanted.

I only get to play for little bursts here and there, although that's something I  am currently trying to change, because frankly RPGs are really important to me. If you don't have the ability to get a group together, you could look into playing online. <a href="http://roll20.net/" rel="nofollow">Roll20</a> is something I've just started looking into - there are games you can sign up to join, or you can create your own in essentially any system (even your own, if you're willing to do some setup). <br/><br/>Failing that, the next best thing would be to listen to some actual play (AP) podcasts. Good ones can be tricky to find, but I really enjoyed <a href="http://strandgamers.com/podcasts/inquisition/" rel="nofollow">this epic Burning Wheel campaign</a>. Even if you just listened to a few episodes, it might give you some idea of what it is that people really dig about BW (hint: it's mostly not the tables). And there are lots of great theory/discussion podcasts out there, too. I'm currently working my way through <a href="http://narrativecontrol.libsyn.com/" rel="nofollow">Narrative Control</a>, which I can't recommend more highly. And its run goes from about 2008 to the present, which means it covers a huge swathe of contemporary thinking and developments in RPGs.<br/><br/>Whatever move you make next I wish you the best of luck, but I think Asfl and Scrape may just have hit on the ideal title for your game: "Heartbreaker"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433899/#Comment_433899" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-16T10:54:34+00:00" title="June 16, 2014 10:54AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Xarcell, you may want to take a look at <a href="http://archeage.xlgames.com/en" rel="nofollow">Archeage</a> (just skip the initial video, it says nothing about the game, the meat of it it's on the rest of the webpage) It's an upcoming MMORPG that looks exactly as what you have described so far, except for the modular rules complexity. It's still medieval fantasy despite the korean RPG dressing.<br/><br/>I'll certainly play this game, not because of the dressing nor the mechanics; not even because it looks like this time the designers worked around the usual issues that make MMORPGs frustrating, but because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUDnDsIV11w" rel="nofollow">things like this can happen</a> while playing it.<br/><br/>It's one of the few times that I've seen (in a MMORPG) that a story is created when players interact with the setting/mechanics. And that's the main reason I prefer storygame RPGs to heavy simulationist rule compendiums or the usual MMORPGs full of grinding and cutscenes. Man, I don't even have the patience to learn a complex game or even navigate through seas of tables to be able to tell a story, unless that very system will make the stories unique and interesting. <br/><br/>For me It's not about the dressing at all, which gods are in the setting of herbs description. It's all about what makes my human fighter PC different from all the NPCs that could share the same stats and options? What could it make me roleplay it different to "ok, I hit it with my sword"? I don't care too much for monster descriptions if there's a drawing of them over their entry on the monster manual, but the wall of stats doesn't tell me anything either. What I need to know as a GM is what kind of things does it usually do that make it frightful? What legends have arised about their actions and how has that affected the place? As a GM, that's what gets me inspired to play a game. <br/><br/>But granted, that's only me, there's actually plenty of players who like games with less to none storygame elements. Best luck out there Xarcell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433901/#Comment_433901" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-16T11:26:03+00:00" title="June 16, 2014 11:26AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2014 11:29AM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to make clear <a href="/forums/profile/Xarcell">@Xarcell</a>, since you seemed to imply that a large part of my big-ass system was "backdrop" or world-specifics - this is not the case.  My intent from the very beginning was to build a generic system, useful for any world, any genre.  So while I <i>did</i> build a game world using it, that world was really just the case-lesson in building and using the system itself.  The world-specific content could be used as a campaign IF you wanted to use it that way, or just viewed as a set of examples showing you how to use the system for creating your own campaign world.  I'm big on examples.<br/><br/>Basically, I'm a systems geek.  Sounds like you are too.  Sometimes when I'm building a system it's easy to <i>not even care</i> what the world is.  That gives you a lot of freedom, thinking like a programmer, you are considering the system first, and all the details about any specific world are really just "data" for the system to process.  Cool.  (In both senses of the word.)  But you still need to moderately detail at least one world in order to even build the system, right?, so you can see if it's working, if it tracks all the shit you want it to track, if it's actually useful to a GM when playing, etc.  So that's what I did.  Basically I multi-purposed my test data.  Maybe that's what you're doing too.  Or maybe it's an idea you can use.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> - awesome.

In my game, there are no classes. To each their own. However, I do have profession guilds in which a character may or may not apply to join, but there are skill perquisites in order to be accepted into that particular profession guild. There are 16 profession guilds. Basically 4 categories with 4 types in each category.<br/><br/>I also don't have levels in my game. However, I do have "fame", which builds up over time when you successfully do things. That's also one of the determining factor to whether or not you get into a profession guild, or special merchants passing by, etc. As your fame increases, you can unlock additional titles for your profession "if" you joined one. There are 5 additional titles you can unlock and use if you want, but you don't even have to use them.<br/><br/>Don't misunderstand my fame system though, it doesn't effect skill levels, attributes, or any of the mechanics. It's basically your reputation, and whether or not you are treated as such as person with high/low rep. With high fame, you might in into a ball, but then again, high fame may attract unwanted attention.<br/><br/>I have more systems in my game, but those systems are not vast or complex, only that there are alot of them, or what I like to call "options". Use them, don't use them, it doesn't matter. All mechanics use the same algorithm. So there isn't additional mathematics to learn.<br/><br/>Most difficulties in which tasks are to be done (skill checks), are solely up to the GM. I wanted the GM to have full control over the difficulties of performing actions or skill checks. So there are no charts saying "this is how hard it is", except for spells and maybe a few other things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433966/#Comment_433966" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-17T12:38:25+00:00" title="June 17, 2014 12:38PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should really analyze more everything that everyone is linking here, as everyone is trying to be helpful in their own way. The name of the game was "Archeage" (whatever that means) and though they explicitely state in their ad website "120 classes" I readed and searched a bit further and what they meant is that they have a classless system (like yours) and that the skills combinations you choose are the ones that define what kind of character you want, so you virtually have 120 combinations of them, which give in their 'silly' way of explaining it, a result of 120 classes. As it seems you missed this, there are perhaps a lot of actual helpful things you may be missing by not analyzing all the other material that everyone is kindly offering. Believe me, none of it is 'silly', even if it's just meant to give you a clue about what other designers are doing that you shouldn't be doing.<br/><br/>On another note, seeing that your game has these many options, I certainly hope your book layout considers a section with the minimal options needed to run the game along with a helpful procedure of how to go into it as both a player (creating a character) and a GM (making prep for say, a single one-shot session). I really hate when I have to navigate back and forth a book with too many options just to get the gist of the game.<br/><br/>Also, you should always think of how the game would appear to inexperienced GMs. Experienced ones can easily handle asigning difficulties, but newcomers totally need the reference chart, even if they read it a single time when learning how to play. Now, if you tell me your game isn't meant to be played by newcomers, I'd still need to see which parts of your game would convince me to buy it. I've seen such Fame mechanics in other games, so there's still nothing new in your game so far. And yet that's nothing bad in itself, it just means your game isn't my thing... yet. ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Xarcell" title="Xarcell"><img alt="Xarcell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Xarcell">Xarcell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433967/#Comment_433967" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-17T13:16:48+00:00" title="June 17, 2014  1:16PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've learned quite alot from this topic and I know everyone is trying to be helpful.

It seems there is nothing unique about it and quite frankly I don't think anyone would give the time of day to try it. Regardless if "I" still think it's the best system.<br/><br/>I'm still going forward with it, but in my own time and it probably won't be finished anytime soon or ever really. I'd rather not discuss it anymore, because the more I discuss it, the less motivated I am to finish it. Every time I say something I think is positive about it there is a negative rebuttal. I'm not blaming anyone here, but it's just how I feel. There are valid points that were made and my game just doesn't have the "it" factor like I hoped it would.<br/><br/>I plan to try release my game for free, but a license needs to be purchased if adopted to use it commercially(which is likely to never happen).

An example which comes to mind is <i>Adventurer, Conqueror, King</i>.<br/><br/>The main point people are making here, I think, is that a game without an original pitch is going to be a hard sell initially. So people want to prepare you emotionally for the potential of failure, and to realign your goals so that you put the work into where it counts. (It would be a shame to develop a huge website/forum/pay-per-month superstructure only to find that only two people are interested in your game, for example.)<br/><br/>Posting snippets of your game, however, is a well-proven marketing strategy, and can give you a good sense of whatever interest may or may not exist for your game.<br/><br/>For example, John Harper posted roughly half the rules for a game he was working on called "The Wildlings", and, even though he never finished the game (at least not publicly), the game has been played by a lot of people and has quite a following. There's very little doubt that, were he to release the whole game for sale now that a bunch of people have heard about it and even spent some time playing it, it would attract a good number of customers.<br/><br/>Good luck to you! I hope we hear from you again sooner or later.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433984/#Comment_433984" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-17T17:05:44+00:00" title="June 17, 2014  5:05PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am posting things to help you be successful, not to convince you that your game is a failure!

I've been giving you a lot of harsh critics because I'm that kind of person, I tend to question everything that doesn't look like the way I'd do it. I know it's unfair and it may come out worse than I meant, but I actually do it because I do want to help you make a game that surprises me, makes me want to play it and at the same time I want to learn a way to do things better, as a designer, as a player and as a GM.<br/><br/>Lately, "better" for me means faster, more efficiently, with as less pieces as possible, the softer learning curve, with the most freedom for players and GMs, the less workload on the GM, able to incorporate as much player input as it can, and using whatever creates a story instead of whatever emulates a sort of physics, a sort of social enviroment, etc. because in my experience I'm already sick of all the nonsense/setting breaking loopholes generated by these kind of rulesets, tired of navigating tons of rules or find out that the character I created isn't "optimized" for the kind of gameplay I'd like to enjoy, or roll a dice to find that nothing happens, that my input to the game is denied or that the character that took me one hour to create (without counting the five hours spent looking for optimized builds and strtategies around the web) died without the chance to do anything of importance on the game.<br/><br/>But also, I have learned trough this forum that my "better" isn't everyone's better, that every game makes sense and flows beautifully if players comprehend the design philosophy behind it and embrace it.<br/><br/>To keep it short, you're doing okey taking all these critics with a grain of salt and going for what you want. Your game is all right, it's just that some of us still consider your expectatives for your website plan and sales are too optimistic considering your time availability for P.R. and we're really worried that if we let you invest so much on the whole project with at least giving you the best advice we can think of, this may end up being the last game you try making and/or publishing. Nobody here wants that. As to why we're so worried, well, we kind of identify with you. We all have been in the same place, there's been actually so many of us in the same place that the term <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/9/" rel="nofollow">"Fantasy Heartbreaker"</a> was coined after everyone who made a "sort of D&amp;D like game, but different and better"<br/><br/>And yet we tell you: go for it. For the love you have for your game. Just don't spend too much time or money that your wife gets mad at you, nor stop making games after that.

I <i>love</i> it when people make D&amp;D-like games and publish PDFs for me to download for a couple bucks. I will buy them, read them, and mine them for ideas. I probably won't play them. I admire the excitement and love that pours out of game creators. I just don't want to see someone bet the farm on one of those games. To a lesser degree, I don't want to see someone build a huge infrastructure or web presence for something that isn't likely to be a fan favorite.

Something portable and easily editable) gives maybe a two-sentence precis on behavior and tactics as a reminder, and arranges the stat blocks into something I can print out and use behind the screen.<br/><br/>I have all kinds of insane fantasies for online tools but they're different for every game because what I have to do to prepare is different for every game. Heck, maybe if your game is really complicated it would be best to make your character sheet a character app that you download to your phone and tap on the thing you want to do from a list/menu, and it brings up the mechanics for the player to remember. Someone's going to do that someday and it's gonna suck, and someone else is going to do that someday and it's gonna be great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434043/#Comment_434043" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-18T19:42:29+00:00" title="June 18, 2014  7:42PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>As I mentioned before I'm currently building the site on blogger.

The D&amp;D trademark logo is an ampersand shaped like a dragon. I have the D&amp;D 3rd addition books and their logo is Dungeons &amp; Dragons with the trademark dragon ampersand and with a sword between the words.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://screamsheet.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/3-5-players-handbook.jpg"/><br/><br/>I did do my research beforehand, there are plenty of dragon logos, but no trademarked dragon &amp; hexagon logo. What I created is unique in a sense, but as I said there are alot of dragon logos out there. If anything, it looks more like the Mortal Kombat logo more than anything else, which was a fighting game that branched out into it's own brand of entertainment.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.logoeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/mortal-kombat-vector-logo.png"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434117/#Comment_434117" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-20T19:46:56+00:00" title="June 20, 2014  7:46PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh, it does look a bit like the Mortal Combat emblem.<br/><br/>As I said, up to you whether you want those associations.

I'm debating if it's worth finishing(near completion) and putting in the additional effort to publish it. So I wanted to ask here among more experienced players if it seems like a good gaming engine. I tried to design it so that it was a table-top first, but could easily be converted to a video game or even a card game without changing the gaming mechanics. It's kinda are to explain how it works, but my legal advice was not to disclose my formulas or algorithms.<br/><br/>The game features 5 playable races, each with 5 sub-races. It has 5 attributes, divided into 3 categories of: Physical, Mental, and Spiritual. There are 120 skills to build, with additional skills that can be had if the player joins a profession guild(joining a guild is not required). There are 16 profession guilds, and 10+ artisan guilds. There are 300 spells in the game, all of which are unique.  The game features weapon/armor breakage mechanics, but not required. It also features environment mechanics, but not required. To also features mass army battles/territory/town mechanics, but not required. There are also item &amp; spell creation &amp; improvement mechanics, but not required. There are also detailed/specific item value mechanics never used before in a table-top game, but not required.<br/><br/>All in all the game is massive, covers everything I could think of. What makes the game really different is that skills are leveled up individually based on success, rather than the whole character. There is no character level, but a character's fame is the closest thing to that. The way the formula works, is that the easier it is to succeed the attempt, the less XP for that skill you get. The harder the successful attempt, the more XP for that skill you get. I choose skill leveling for a few reasons. One that it didn't make sense to me for a character to level up, and improve skills never/hardly used. Another reason is that an highly experienced character can play with low experienced characters and be close to equals by simply using skills that are less developed. For example, the experienced character is highly skilled in edged weapons, but could switch over to blunt weapons with new character/players for more balanced gameplay without having to make another character to fit in with the group power-wise.<br/><br/>My fears about the game is that it may be too complicated for beginners. The skill formula is slightly complicated I feel (although my wife had no idea what she was looking at and couldn't even begin the equation). Also, I think tracking various skill levels might be over-whelming for some. I tried to design it so that various gaming mechanics would not be required in order to play, but be available at a whim for more experienced players looking for more of a challenge. <br/><br/>So has anyone here ever played a table-top RPG that used skill-leveling, rather than character leveling? Was it fun? Do you think a majority of players would like it? I would like to hear some feedback on what I've described thus far, and I can answer questions if you have them. I am also open to suggestions.<br/><br/><b>EDIT</b>: FYI, I am 35 and I don't have anyone that can play test this game for me. Nor do I know anyone that has any D&amp;D experience that can give me some sort of feedback on what I've designed. So I came here.</blockquote>\nI suggest you start an online game via google + to playtest your game. You may also want to check out all the different online rpg communities to see what audience your game might appeal to. There are different communities with different interests favoring different kinds of design. Knowing if you fall into a particular group is important because marketing to the wrong crowd or building a game based on advice from a community that doesn't share your goals can steer you in the wrong direction. But above get several months if playtesting in. It sounds like that is the area you really need to focus on first. Running games online is pretty easy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19457/several-questions-about-my-game-design" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19457/several-questions-about-my-game-design" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19457/several-questions-about-my-game-design/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F19457%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F19457%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
