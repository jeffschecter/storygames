It seemed like a solid triangle.  <br/>That's all I knew for a few months.  Then recently, the idea came to introduce cold as a another character.<br/>Would people enjoy playing the Cold as much as they enjoy playing the Hunter?  <br/>I'm thinking Despair should be like reverse hit points, added to not subtracted from.<br/>Maybe Cold has Sun, Wolf has Hunger, Dog has ?, and Hunter has Despair?<br/>This could maybe make a neat micro-game?<br/> <br/> <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419278/#Comment_419278" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-30T22:22:59+00:00" title="July 30, 2013 10:22PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The dog should have Loyalty (which either way will lead it to it's demise, but will give it's life a purpose) also added like the Hunter's despair.

To me, that's the point of a survival type story - the challenges to what is easy under normal circumstances.<br/><br/>Fear was meant as the flipside to Loyalty, to make all the currencies (the effects) be negatives. Fear is what challenges loyalty. It's easy to be loyal when you're not afraid. The man and the dog both work together well until either gets too scared, but the Dog is susceptible, so it's most likely to be a problem for it first.<br/><br/>I like the idea of them being currencies as a representation of zero sum dramatic transactions. The Wolf steals the rabbit out of the Man's trap before the Man gets to it - the Wolf transfers some of it's Hunger to the man. The Man makes a fire - the Man transfers some of his Cold to the Wolf (jealous of the warmth now that it's there).

He must also steal food from the Hunter but only the Hunter can feed the Dog to keep it from starving. Driving the Hunter Home or freeing the Dog are his goals.<br/><br/>The Winter doesn't want anyone to win. Winter can give or take resources to play the others against one another but by the end of a certain turn limit, he wins if no-one else has.<br/><br/>Special moves such as "To Build a Fire" would cost one resource to gain/lose another or some other tactical advantage.

And the Dog is the only one who know the Hunter better than he knows himself: the Dog, with his strong companion bond and sense of intuition, might sense what's happening with the Hunter even when the Hunter doesn't realize it himself.<br/><br/>And yes, of course the Dog may fall to the "wild side", going feral and abandoning Man. He should be torn between the two whenever possible. In this way the Man and the Wolf can vie for the Dog's loyalty.<br/><br/>The Wolf might be torn between remaining wild or submitting to the Hunter (who maybe has more food than he does). The Hunter wants to cow and impress him, maybe even tame him. But the Dog wants to drive the Wolf away... or join him.<br/><br/>The Hunter is torn between wishing to return home and pushing on ahead against the challenges will face him. <br/><br/>In a darker version, perhaps one of the temptations is for the Hunter to eat the Dog...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419407/#Comment_419407" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-01T20:30:46+00:00" title="August  1, 2013  8:30PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, that would be the worst case scenario, one devouring each other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419409/#Comment_419409" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-01T21:43:21+00:00" title="August  1, 2013  9:43PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One weird idea would be:<br/><br/>The game ends when two of the players get together to eat one of the others.

So, it could be played with as few as 1 player, or as many as 4(or however many roles it ends up being). Maybe that's biting a bit too much?  Getting the card-play to match the tone of the story could be complicated.  I could see each card listing variables like "If this... then this... "  Like, if the Wolf is this Hungry then this happens, but if the Wolf is only this Hungry then this happens with this card.

Split the whole deck among the players; let's say clubs are Loyalty. If the Dog's player has no clubs left, the dog becomes Wild. If the Wolf ends the game with too many clubs, he's Tamed. Hunter spends spades to hunt same as the wolf, both compete for hearts. Whoever ends the game with no hearts, dies from starving, and so on. <br/><br/>Player's won't know which resources each other have, so dog's loyalty can switch without notice, wolf or hunter can end up escaping from each other if they don't have spades to attack.<br/><br/>Each player would get a page with the moves they can do, which resources they spend to get what and their victory conditions.

Frankly, I blame you for planting the seed in my head and now I have to dig it out.<br/><br/>I did something unfortunate in my previous post; I encoded clear win/lose conditions in the characters. That's fine for a "gamey" game of resources but it seems to narrow the possibilities of the fiction. <br/><br/>I only have the vaguest notion of the actual play of the game and I can't really help with the mechanics. But I know that if I were tasked with it's design, it would be a game of words over resources. As such, it wouldn't be "heads" over "tails"; both sides of the coin would have to be appealing. This is most obvious in my unfortunate wording of the Dog. I was going by the story (Jack London was required reading in my school system).<br/><br/>By simply changing the word Hungry to Loyalty (albeit probably bought by food), the "Tails" option is suddenly far more agreeable and identifiable.<br/><br/>Yes, I've <i>been </i>hungry. I did the 30 Hour Fast ONCE! when I was younger and I think I cheated near the end with some broth. But I always had the option to eat. I've <i>been </i>hungry but I've never <i>known </i>hunger. I know Loyalty. I can buy into that easily.<br/><br/>I'm Canadian. I've <i>been </i>cold (on job sites where it's a requirement) but I always had the option to get warm. I don't <i>know </i>cold. But I certainly know the desire to go home. That's one instance where I think I worded it right - as opposed to "Giving Up" which carries a definite negative connotation.<br/><br/>Cold and Hungry should be infused in the game through words: omni-present; encoded in the language. But "desire versus need" should present both as desirable. Sitting comfortably around a table with snacks, Cold and Hungry seem distant and poor motivators. Again I will site the story, where-in our sympathy is clearly with the Dog and we don't feel much for the prideful and foolish Hunter. That should be one possible outcome but not the only one.<br/><br/>In negotiations arguements should be equally viable for both sides of the coin. Physically, there should be words/phrases present but in what form, I don't know: character sheets/pamphlets<i></i><i></i>/ cards. I'm afraid I can't help there. <br/><br/>In short, all of this is simply to say that I think you have  the germ of an intriguing game and I hope something grows from it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Domon" title="Domon"><img alt="Domon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forumtgmonline.futuregamer.it/customavatars/avatar10232_0.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Domon">Domon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419535/#Comment_419535" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-04T02:22:32+00:00" title="August  4, 2013  2:22AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the fact that no dialogue is involved (though i guess dog and wolf could talk, and it would be a game were the human is silent except for barfing orders and warnings to the dog, while the beasts talk.<br/>Om too-much-locked roles.
