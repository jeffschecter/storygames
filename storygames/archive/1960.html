                    So in the "Everybody's too Consensus-y Groupthink-y" thread (<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1951&amp;page=2#Comment_45681" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1951&amp;page=2#Comment_45681</a>) some dudes are like, "Hey we don't get satisfying arguments anymore."<br/>
<br/>
And--though I've stayed out of the discussion mostly--I'm like, "Well, okay, what do you want to argue about?"<br/>
<br/>
Which is another way of saying: <b>"What don't you (you, anybody) understand about gaming yet?"</b>  Because odds are, nobody else really understands it either.  I used to have a professor who said, "Make the easy questions hard, because really they are hard."  And I think that applies.<br/>
<br/>
So--I'm curious.  This is a thread for anyone, from n00b's to gaming to old-timers, to ask a question that they don't understand about gaming.  And then, people can split that off into other threads.  But mainly I'm curious to see what's on people's minds.<br/>
<br/>
For me: "I don't understand what a role-playing game is.  How is it different than playing with toy soldiers?  How is it different from collaborating on a novel?  Is Mechaton, as Vincent, Emily and NinJ are playing it, a role-playing game?  Is Dungeons &amp; Dragons?  (where's the difference)?  Is Universalis a role-playing game?  How is it different than collaborating on writing a novel?"  (I have a theoretical answer, but that's best saved for a full thread devoted to this.  This thread is just, 'What don't you understand?')<br/>
<br/>
For me, also: "What makes a good setting?"<br/>
<br/>
And for me also, "What makes a rich character?"                </div>

                            Hey James<br>
My take on your 3 questions<br>
"I don't understand what a role-playing game is. <br>
 A RPG or Role Playing Game is where an interactive story of some kind is being told. Either with words, with computer games, etc, some sort of story made up by everyone involved is being created for entertainment. <br>
"What makes a good setting?"<br>
 A good setting is one, for me, where I want to go to, want to be in, want to live there, or at least go and visit, it has something there that I like. <br>
 "What makes a rich character?" <br>
 A Rich Character is one that seems like it could be a real person. Or in many cases, more real than the people you work with who seem so mono-dimensional in the workplace.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Hey, James, were you seeing us just posing the questions here? And discussion of each one can be spun off into other threads?<br><br>- How, in people's brains, do 'character thoughts and decisions that leap out at me' get separated from 'rules of play.' Sure it's all system, yeah yeah. But at least for "immersive" play, there's some psychological difference. Is it a real difference? Can the two work together?<br><br>- What's up with the player goal of "just tooling around in a world, and fiddling with equipment lists; make minor tactical decisions but also long-term ones that alter the course of the campaign.' How do I analyze that method of play? I know why Ron's CAs can each be fun...why is that one fun too? Is that merely poor, limp play; a relic of patched-up wargames cum RPGs? Or is it something that's solid and respectable? (Should I stop looking down on it?) Could really focused games -- like we've been doing around here -- be made to support this (maybe making it respectable)?<br><br/>- What was that thing I did as a kid running around in the woods? I think that's RPing somehow. Can RPGs as we work with them now do that kind of play?                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            Yeah, this is meant as a compilation thread of things (anyone) doesn't understand, so it can be spun off into other things.  If you really want an answer to your question, I'd suggest starting a new thread specifically for it.<br/>
<br/>
Mainly, I'm being a bad citizen here in a way, and very passive-aggressive, because it seems ridiculous to me that there's a 124 post thread (and counting) about how there's nothing interesting left to discuss.  Starting a valuable discussion on the Internet is easy: confess genuine ignorance, and wait.                        </div>

                            My main question is why the worry about the differences between old school (like me) and the SG/Forge stuff. <br>
Actually I dont get the why the antagonism exhibited towards the existing game systems driving the urge to just keep making more and more outre' stuff all the time.                        </br></div>

Jonathan, just for clarification's sake, you're talking the Anglo RPG design community, ie, the medium for RPG distribution is commercial here, and it's non-commercial elsewhere?  You're not talking about Angle RPGs and equipment lists?  (Or are they the same thing?)                        </div>

<br/>
JD--there was actually a pretty good SG thread about the distinction between "task-" and "conflict-" resolution, maybe 1-2 months ago?  I think it was called "intent-relevant play" or something.  Somebody had an awesome chart they busted out, it explained a lot to me.                        </div>

                            Here's my big one:<br/>
<br/>
If I'm using a bunch of new techniques -- conflict resolution, shared narration, all that stuff -- and my roleplaying is undoubtedly more intellectually rigorous and honest (in terms of protagonism, access to system, share of the load) then what does it say if I don't have as much fun as I used to when I played in an unexamined way?<br/>
<br/>
Do I not want what I think I want?<br/>
Do I misunderstand the techniques?<br/>
Is it just a side effect of ageing?<br/>
Is it because I'm not gaming with the same people I was when I was in the "sweet spot" a few years back?<br/>
Or is there something else out there that I need to learn still, and add to the mix?<br/>
<br/>
Complementary to the above question:  If I spent a bunch of time playing (and mainly running) games that were <i>fun</i> and it later turns out that there are various, totally valid, intellectual critiques of the techniques I used to run those games, then what should I learn from that?<br/>
<br/>
Curious,<br/>

                            OH, hey, JD, the conflict/task res thing is here: <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1728&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1728&amp;page=1</a> but it gets pretty lengthy.  There's a fair amount of back &amp; forth before people realize that "task" and "conflict" are sorta opaque, BS terms and they switch to using 'intent" instead, which I find a bit more helpful.                        </div>

                            Something I don't understand: Color. How does it get generated in play, how do multiple players converge on a shared library of appropriate and interesting Color, how does Color get transformed into/leverage the other elements of exploration? I know - sort of - how that happens in my own play experience, but I think there's a lot of complexity and diversity in other people's answers, and I don't really <i>understand</i> what is going on when I am doing it.                        </div>

                            I don't understand the marriage of game (in sense of boardgames, which I perceive a lot of the new small press roleplaying games paying homage to) and roleplaying. I think I understand how and even some of the why, but from personal perspective I don't understand why players want to retain the sense of playing a game and their role as players, instead of adapting a role of a fictional individual in a fictional enviroment. I think it's a similar kind of lack of understand I have with american football; I like soccer, both games have a green field and a ball, but I just don't get the former, despite the similarities. <br><br>That's the main lack of understanding. Most of the others emerge from that one - I don't, for example, understand the role of game designer, neither in the sense of re-inventing wheel ("traditional" roleplaying design regarding the rules) or in the sense of designing these new, boardgame-like games (where a game designer kind of takes a role of a Super-GM, establishing the setting and crafting a tight set of procedures that dictate the flow of the game). This is confusing; from where I come from, there's a gaping hole regarding the procedures, very little emphasis on the mechanics, and the person or persons taking the role of GM do everything from setting design to, usually, character design. I do understand the role of game design as concept designer, though.<br><br>I don't understand where all the horror tales of dysfunctional play and all the stuff about GM authority suppressing players originate from. I suspect that I'm living in a comfy barrel.<br><br>There's a lot of things I don't understand but I think those form the crux of it.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

RE: 3. What would a RPG look like that didn't portray the PCs (or all the PCs) as the protagonists?<br/>
<br/>
  A lot of games sort of enable this kind of play (D&amp;D and most White Wolf for instance. White Wolf enables this through the emphasis on signature chars). And, frankly, its not very fun. I mean, if the Protagonists can do it, what do you need me for?<br/>

                            What I want to know is, what took me so long?  I came to gaming pretty late, when I was 26, after having been intrigued by D&amp;D and the like for ages.  I had friends and brothers who gamed all along, but for some reason I never thought to say, "Hey, can I try this?"  And it never seemed like something, as a completely inexperienced person, I could organize on my own.  That's kind of sad, because ever since I started gaming earlier this year, I've found an outlet for creative urges that I'd almost forgotten I had.  It's been a blast, and I've made some really great friends in the process, too.<br/><br/>Related to that (and I think someone said something similar earlier, but I can't find the precise post), we all know that being inexperienced in RPGs doesn't keep someone from "getting it" and being a great player.  Can someone who's inexperienced in RPGs be a good GM?                        </div>

                            My current question is this: what quality distinguishes a game (story, role playing, etc) from a social gathering, sitting around telling a story together?  This question arises from the hypothesis that some purported games do not in fact possess this quality in a decided way, which has been my experience over the last year.                        </div>

                            One thing that I've always had a problem with is finding the right people to game with. I've tried some of the open gaming season deals at stores and the people there were so different from me that I had a hard time relating. Probably just me though. How do you find a group that's cool? On a side note (boy these questions probably make me look dysfunction or something) how do you get over that fear of gaming with a new group? And cons, for those that go, how do you deal with gaming with all those new people -- who you don't know and have never gamed with before? I guess the only times that I've felt good about gaming with strangers is when playing games that aren't role-playing. The only time I won at Diplomacy was when I only knew one other person at the game, and that didn't bother me. It seems like the step into role-playing is more intimate and brings with it more fear or something for me. Anyone else like that? Perhaps it's just some type of irrational fear.<br/><br/>I've really never understood the GNS theory stuff. Shrug. Not sure why it's even important.<br/><br/>Never understood the rpgpundit guy. Is he for real or is he just Rush?<br/><br/>Why aren't there more rpgs that combine role-playing with board games?<br/><br/>Why a character sheet? Why not just a bunch of play aids, tokens, score keeping devices, and cool forms not dealing with characters?<br/><br/>Why not a group of characters played by everyone who moves them to some sort of player goal?                        </div>

                            1) I don't understand why it's so much fun to design a character. I mean, JUST sitting and fiddling with characters without any immediate intent to play them, maybe not even any <i>eventual</i> intent. It's not so fun in, like, Dogs or PTA, which are for sure geared for <i>playing</i> the characters, period. But in D&amp;D, GURPS/Champs/BESM, etc? Oh yeah.<br/><br/>2) I don't understand voluntarily doing boring stuff. OK, that's subjective as hell, but what I mean is fiddling around with describing and adjudicating really unimportant things that don't get us where we all want to go in the game. Not "roll to cross the street," but damn close sometimes.<br/><br/>3) I don't understand Simulationism. Like, the desire for verisimilitude, sure. But how it dfits in the Big Model, I still don't get. Is it the Beeg Horseshoe, or what? The only reason I've been able to sit comfortably with the Theory is 'cause i'm so Nar-happy, but now I'm starting to worry over Sim again.<br/><br/>Y'know, I'm impatient and I'm just gonna start threads on all of these right now.*<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>*OK, more accurately , I found myself <i>writing</i> a virtual thread on each item, so I'm just copying and pasting. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Why are so many people still trying to shoehorn D20 to fit their needs rather than actually try out a new game system <i>in toto</i>? I'm thinking about recurring things like, "Hey, I could use <i>Universalis</i> to generate backstory for my D&amp;D game!" (Hey, you could just play <i>Universalis</i> instead of D&amp;D, it's more fun!) or "Using conflict resolution/kickers &amp; bangs/whatever in D&amp;D." (Uh, use a game based on conflict res from the ground up.) or "Hey, this new $35 D&amp;D supplement is like <i>Sorcerer</i>! (Uh, play <i>Sorcerer</i>.)<br/><br/>Why is the vast huge market share for RPGs still focused on the (dilute) "fantasy" genre? Is there some inherent high-crossover personality trait between fantasy junkies and roleplayers?<br/><br/>What's the deal with Forgotten Realms? Are you people really that oblivious to the interrelatedness of real-world cultural, philosophical, and economic structures?<br/><br/>High-Exploration Sim is theoretically something I want to get into. Why, in practice, does it suck so much?<br/><br/>Why are people still conflating Ephemeras with Creative Agenda when there's a body of information already available that explains these things?<br/><br/>Why on earth is anybody afraid/resentful of the Forge?<br/><br/>What is the simplest, most concise explanation/object lesson to cut past years of entrenched gamer baggage ("role-playing is <i>this</i>") and open the minds of one's gamer friends (emphasis on the friends) to the full spectrum of possibilities that these games have to offer?                        </div>

                            Larry, <br/><br/>As for your first point, I know several folks that do that. For some of them it's fear of doing something totally new. For others its the fact that neither D&amp;D nor Universalis (or whatever) fills their needs. So they want to cobble two things together in order to get the end result they want when neither thing alone does it. For some it ends in disaster, for some it ends in brilliance. (I've a friend running a Mage game that they set up the world for with Universalis and that has a PTA screen presence and season mechanic, but that uses Mage rules for resolution of conflicts. Flying in the face of everything I thought about the universe before hand, it's working out brilliantly.) <br/><br/>For your last point, the one that's worked best for me is playing Dogs. Then talking about it. Then letting it stew for a couple months. Then playing TSOY. Then sending them to GenCon and having them go to the Forge booth. <br/><br/>Of course, this is neither concise nor easy, so if someone comes up with a quicker way around it, please let me know. <br/><br/>What I don't get is, aside from a desperate need to feel that your choices are validated by everyone else liking exactly what you like, why the fuck is it so hard for RPers to honestly say, "Well heck, that's not what I like, but if it works for you then awesome!" <br/><br/>Also, why is it that so many RPers seem to get more fun from tearing shit down and trying to destroy each others games, conversations, and communities than they do from actually playing the games?                        </div>

                            Brand, regarding your last two paragraphs:<br/><br/>I'm genuinely interested in why people enjoy something that I don't. Maybe <i>I'm</i> the one missing out, and should be persuaded to their point of view. I am quite willing to risk coming across looking like a contentious ass in this pursuit, and similarly willing to overlook occasional jerkishness in others for the same. (Yeah, I know that probably wasn't directed at me specifically, but uh, hopefully I'm not the only one whose motivations are similarly positive.)<br/><br/>Geez, man... why do <i>human beings</i> get off on tearing down others instead of advancing their own constructive contributions? Are RPers really more virulent in this regard than people in general? (Not a rhetorical question! Maybe they are, I dunno.)<br/><br/>Also, I wanna see some AP on that Mage/Uni/PTA!                        </div>

<div class="QuoteText">Why does Panty Explosion require a GM (Superintendant)?</div>
</blockquote>
<br/>
It dosent. You can play Panty Explosion perfectly well without a Superintendenmt. So why dosen't it say so in the book? Well... We had intended to present the game with several different options, one of which was playing without a Superintendent. We never really got around to it, although we'll likely put up some information on that on our site at some point. Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
As to why PE ended up with a GM, I can't really say for sure. It just sort of evolved that way. Both Matt and I mostly play in gM-less games, so I guess thats kind of weird. I think PE is pretty GM light though. Ideally, the Superintendent is just the player in charge of the Demon. The responsibilty of creating a narrative lies as much with the Students as it does the Superintendent. More if your playing it "right" (the way I play it). Students choose their own Agendas, their goals that they want to follow through the game. They choose their relationships. They are responsible for narrating each others sucesses and failures. They can create scenes, and define elements of scenes created by the Superintendent. But the Superintendent, in a real way, is still calling the shots.<br/>
<br/>
Getting rid of the Superintedent is pretty easy though. In fact, if you simply make the Demon dice somthing that everyone can use to create conflicts and antagonistic situations then the need for the Superintendent disapears entirely. you'll have to sit down before the game and design your school together, but thats supposed to be something you do anyway, and you don't really need the Superintendent to guide you through it.<br/>
<br/>
If I ever go back and do a major revision of Panty Explosion I'll probably make changes along those lines.<br/>
<br/>
Does that answer your question in anty way what-so-ever?<br/>
