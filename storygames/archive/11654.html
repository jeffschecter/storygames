It was also my very first time running ToC. The experience has made me realize I am really, really bad at running prepared adventures.<br/><br/>I can't even remember the last time I attempted it. Might've been when I was writing for Deadlands. So, what, 14 years ago?<br/><br/>The entire experience is nearly alien to me any more. No looking for character flags, no leveraging Beliefs against one another, no thematically meaningful improvisation around an organically evolving plot. On the other hand, hey, it's all right there and the detail (esp. in Black Drop) is exquisite.<br/><br/>I think that, last night, my biggest error was not fully reading, studying and internalizing the adventure materials before jumping in. But all that reading/studying/internalizing sure seems like it qualifies as "prep". :-/ I'm wondering if I'm just better off putting that same time into doodling up my own stuff.<br/><br/>Does anyone have any good advice for squeezing the most out of a prepared adventure? More to the point, does anyone have any good advice for squeezing the most out of a prepared ToC adventure? Because it seems like the game is built for prep, I don't have time to prep, so if I'm going to be playing ToC I'll be running their prepared adventures.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259874/#Comment_259874" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-03T09:01:11+00:00" title="March  3, 2010  9:01AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you using pregens?<br/><br/>I find premade [X]oC games are just inherently better with pregens.

They're all tied to the adventure, one-shot style. We then went through and applied our own stats to things -- very nice approach, since the stat-giving step gives the players ownership.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259883/#Comment_259883" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-03T09:19:20+00:00" title="March  3, 2010  9:19AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm. So I think I'm missing part of your main thrust then. It sounds like things went really well.<br/><br/>I guess the main difference is a lack of emotional attachment to the pre-made mmodule then?<br/><br/>I mean, the prep is just different for the two, isn't it? I mean, the personalization comes in-game with the pre-made module, where there's a l ot of personal work and commitment with your own, home built game.<br/><br/>Think of it this way: If you did prep for both kinds of session, but one got cancelled at the last moment, which would make you feel more unhappy?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259891/#Comment_259891" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-03T09:37:31+00:00" title="March  3, 2010  9:37AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay so the problem I had was this: There's a mix of Keeper-only information and general descriptive information attached to each set piece. There aren't scenes <i>per se</i> already worked out; that's on the ToC Keeper to work out based on what he's given. This is, at least, how Black Drop is written. Dunno about other modules (although I also own Graham's Dying of St. Margaret's).<br/><br/>So I read through everything related to the given phase. It's not much, probably less than 1000 words. And then I find myself struggling to set up scenes that are grabby and evocative. That's the skill I've lost: read someone else's narrative and then repackage that narrative into something other players will be interested in. It's like the Telephone Game in a way: Jason tells me, then I have to tell my players but in an edited/spun way. It's a creative limitation on my part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_259904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259904/#Comment_259904" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-03T10:07:56+00:00" title="March  3, 2010 10:07AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah.

What makes you think that you should be setting up grabby and evocative scenes from the get-go?  In the actual Cthulhu stories, pretty much the first third of any story is almost a snorefest.  Nothing is really happening except the characters are going about their business and "oh that's odd".  Gaming jumps to the first "oh that's odd", but the source material really isn't a hammer hitting your face over and over, not until the end anyway.  <br/><br/>Having some not-much-is-happening scenes also helps people get into their pregens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_259920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/259920/#Comment_259920" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-03T11:38:45+00:00" title="March  3, 2010 11:38AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a couple of notes - Jason is right, The Black Drop does, indeed, have a deliberate slow build.

Different people run ToC different ways. It's about finding a way you enjoy running it. I realise that sounds impossibly broad, but that's the goal: not to discover the way Ken Hite wants you to run it; but to discover what works for you.</li>\n<li>You can totally respond to character flags, beliefs and so on. I enjoy Trail of Cthulhu best when it's about the characters. The mystery is just a crucible to put them under pressure, to show who the characters really are.</li>\n<li>It's good if players interact. If you can go and get a coffee, while they're arguing in character, you're doing something right. Encourage them to build relationships.</li>\n<li>Play the NPCs. Which Investigator would they like? Which would they distrust?</li>\n<li>If someone says "I spend a point of Reassurance", tell them to roleplay it as they spend the point. Interpersonal skills are cues for roleplay, not replacements for it.</li>\n<li>The preplanned scenario is a big sandbox to play in. It's like your group had decided to run an adventure in the Arctic, so you've gone away and learned about the Arctic, so there's something to bring to the table.</li>\n<li><i>The Dying Of St Margaret's</i> totally pwns <i>The Black Drop</i>.</li></ul>\nGraham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260080/#Comment_260080" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-04T10:18:19+00:00" title="March  4, 2010 10:18AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm thinking a "ToC Best Practices" thread might be interesting.
