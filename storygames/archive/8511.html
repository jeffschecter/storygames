So this is me attempting to catalog my thoughts on fiat and what it is and where we find it as kind of a foundation for talking about how to use it in different ways to accomplish different goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo first a note on definitions.  I\u2019ve got no problem with specialized jargon when the normal English word has tremendously nuanced and imprecise useage, like say \u201cGame\u201d or \u201cStory\u201d.  And I\u2019ve got no problem with specialized jargon when there really isn\u2019t a mainstream word for the concept and its clear that the word being used is unique jargon, like say \u201cNarrativism\u201d or \u201cAuthor Stance\u201d.  But I do have a problem with ascribing unique jargony meaning to a word that is simple direct and straight forward and immediately applicable to RPGs without needing to be modified.  Fiat is such a word, so here I will be using the normal English non jargony definition, which Webster\u2019s tells us is:<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cAn authoritative command or order to do something; an effectual decree.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nRandom House expands that to \u201can authoritative decree, sanction, or order:\u201d which I like because sanction includes giving permission to do something as well as originating it.   The definition of sanction being \u201cauthoritative permission or approval, as for an action\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nSo armed with this we can see a myriad of applications of fiat in any RPG.  I\u2019m going to look at just one set of examples, the use of fiat in resolution systems.<br/>\n<br/>\n(cont'd)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188682/#Comment_188682" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T12:24:33+00:00" title="January 16, 2009 12:24PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2009 12:55PM by Valamir.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Consider a common RPG situation where the players have just announced some clever plan that will allow them to circumvent some plot obstacle and the various ways.  The GM might respond:<br/>\n<br/>\n1)\t\u201cHmm, that\u2019s not really covered, ok, we\u2019ll used a modified version of the such and such subsystem for that.  Instead of rolling X &amp; Y skills you\u2019ll roll A &amp; B skills\u201d<br/>\n2)\t\u201cHmm, that\u2019s not really covered, roll a die against your Z Attribute to see if you can pull it off.<br/>\n3)\t\u201cHmm, that\u2019s not really covered, ok, roll a die, on a 3 or better you succeed\u201d<br/>\n4)\t\u201cHmm that\u2019s not really covered but it\u2019s a really clever idea, ok, it works.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nClearly, we can see fiat at work in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>.  But look a little farther and we can see that there is fiat in all of them, but in progressively smaller chunks.  In <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a> the entire resolution of the outcome is by fiat.  In <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> the outcome is left to a completely random roll, but the decision to make that roll in the first place and what to roll against was made by fiat.  In <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, the outcome is again random but its not completely arbitrary (presumably there\u2019s some connection between attribute Z and the current effort), but again the decision to resolve in that fashion was by fiat.  In <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, the resolution is largely handled in the same way as the book directs other resolutions to be handled but the decision to modify the system was made by fiat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we postulate a <a href="/forums/search?Search=%230&amp;Mode=like">#0</a> where no modification was necessary and this situation was completely addressed by the rules in the book, one could say that the GM did not exercise fiat here because presumably using this particular rules text was a group consensus and not a decree.  One could go on to say that there is designer fiat at work here as it would be the non present designer decreeing \u201cin this situation use these rules\u201d but for simplicity this example is only looking at GM fiat.  Further we can conclude that in most games there will eventually come a situation that the rules don\u2019t directly address and so some other decision must be made.<br/>\n<br/>\nLets, look again at <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> but change things up a bit:<br/>\n<br/>\n1b) \u201cHmm, that\u2019s not really covered, its kind of close to subsystem such and such, lets use a modified version of that.  What do you all think, how should we modify the skill use to get it to work?\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nHere, instead of deciding on the modifications by fiat, as in <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, the GM is soliciting collaboration / consensus, which is essentially the polar opposite of fiat (let\u2019s ignore for this example the possibility of the GM soliciting collaboration but, finding no consensus, goes on to rule by fiat anyway).  Is this example devoid then of fiat?  No, because the decision to solicit the input from the other players was made by fiat, and just as easily could have not been made.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more modification.  Let\u2019s postulate for 1c) that the rules actually instruct the GM when something comes up that isn\u2019t explicitly covered to use the closest subsystem and solicit collaboration and consensus for how to apply those rules to this situation.  Would THAT case be at long last free of fiat?  Philosophically, speaking I say no, because I tend to think that no decision can ever be made that you can't find fiat somewhere, but I think we\u2019ve at least reached an example where it would take a good bit more poking and prodding and additional details to find it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188683/#Comment_188683" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T12:24:53+00:00" title="January 16, 2009 12:24PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2009 12:57PM by Valamir.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here\u2019s what I take away from this series of examples:<br/>\n<br/>\na)\tThere is fiat present in every one of them.  In the ones towards the top of the list the fiat is broken into smaller pieces with smaller scale and scope, while in the last one the fiat is in one big homogenous chunk.<br/>\nb)\tEvery individual player / group will have a threshold below which they\u2019d consider the game to be low fiat, and above which they\u2019d consider the game to be high fiat.<br/>\nc)\tEvery individual player / group will have a preference for how much fiat the want / don\u2019t want in their play.  They might say \u201cover all this is a low fiat game, but its not low enough\u201d or \u201cYeah, this is a high fiat game, but there are places where I\u2019d like it to be higher\u201d or any other combination.<br/>\nd)\tThere\u2019s no such thing as a \u201cno fiat\u201d game.  There are only games where the fiat has been broken up into small enough pieces for the player to accept it.<br/>\ne)\tWe could repeat this exercise a bunch more times to cover player fiat, designer fiat, GM fiat over things other than resolution, etc.  We could take each of the kinds of GM authority that have been discussed (content authority, color authority, etc) and come up with a similar tiered example of big chunk vs small chunk fiat.  We could come up with a similar list for players and do the same, on and on.  In each case I think what we\u2019d find would parallel the above.  Some systems grant fiat over certain areas in large chunks.  Others break up the fiat into smaller chunks.  And every player / group will have a preference for what size chunks they like\u2026which may not be the same for each example.<br/>\nf)\tThere are lots of ways to break up fiat into smaller chunks.  Broadly speaking I think the three main umbrella categories would be:  1) falling on the rules as an authority (which is essentially breaking up / alternating chunks of GM fiat with chunks of Designer fiat), 2) having the buck stop somewhere else for certain things or at certain times (i.e. breaking up / alternating chunks of GM fiat with chunks of Some-Other-Player fiat, and 3) drive towards collaboration consensus as a way of avoiding a fiat based decision.<br/>\ng)\tAll of this is completely independent of Fortune / Karma / or Drama resolution as we could come up with examples of using any of these in any of the above.<br/>\nh)\tCollaboration / consensus may have the advantage of avoiding fiat (if we assume that there is no single personality so strong as to essentially drive the decision such that the consensus is only an illusion) but it has plenty of disadvantageous as well (such as breaking the flow of play and operating at a decidedly meta level).  So in situations where the disadvantages of collaboration / consensus are too great we must turn to decision by fiat.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately then the question comes down to this\u2026both from a design standpoint and an actual play standpoint\u2026who\u2019s fiat?

In all of your above examples you posit that something "outside" the scope of the rules has come up.  Something like Sorcerer's Currency avoids that though because there's always a little pool of dice lying around to represent the kinetic energy of what's happening.  Sure, "by fiat" you have to decide where exactly to direct that energy and exactly what it's lending narrative weight too but you never have to make up a new mechanic or jury-rig an existing one to "fit."  It's also usually fairly obvious from the context of play with very little chance of disagreement.<br><br>From that perspective my mind is much, much more accepting of "Player announces action and GM says what happens" as the totality of the system because it is indeed complete in that it treats everything consistently with no need to design new parts mid-game.  And it's a far cry more honest than giving the GM Fiat authority over whether the system gets used at all (i.e. Rule 0).<br><br>Jesse                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188687/#Comment_188687" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T13:04:56+00:00" title="January 16, 2009  1:04PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Ultimately then the question comes down to this\u2026both from a design standpoint and an actual play standpoint\u2026who\u2019s fiat?

The biggest problems I've seen with fiat regard unpredictability.  As a player, if you never know when the GM will exercise fiat, or at what scale, then you have no idea how to contribute in a way that'll yield meaningful results.  So, you get confused and disoriented, hopping from moments of fun to moments of suck, looking to the GM for guidance at every step.  If, on the other hand, use of GM fiat is consistent, then you get clarity (either "this is the game for me" or "this isn't the game for me") pretty quickly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_188705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188705/#Comment_188705" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T14:35:55+00:00" title="January 16, 2009  2:35PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph:  I worry that, at the point where you're saying that a GM who actively seeks consensus and solicits input is engaged in "fiat" because he <i>chose</i> to solicit input, you've wandered away from the plain-english definition.

What I mean is, ultimately all decisions at the table are really a table consensus where a sub-case is where the table agrees good naturedly to let one person make decisions. Until the decision is crap, at which point it gets re-negotiated. After all, the real-world players are likely not under anyone elses (at the table) authority (try fining your players real money some time) so they are always at liberty to re-negotiate power relationships.<br><br>I don't think fiat exists as you describe it as the authority doesn't exist. Which is why it can be toxic both when players refuse to acknowledge their real-world relationship (as free and equal) and when they refuse to surrender to the mock authority for play where it would be appropriate.<br><br>I think any discussion of GM fiat has to take into account the fragility of a GM's "authority". That's the wire the GM is walking all the time, and why she needs to be very careful throwing  weight around.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188719/#Comment_188719" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T15:56:17+00:00" title="January 16, 2009  3:56PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2009 3:57PM by David_Berg.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, all that depends on which frame you want to bring to the discussion, right?

All discussions of system start from the assumption that whatever system is being used is being used because everyone agreed to use it.  But that doesn't make the authority illusory...it just makes it revocable.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I'm the GM and you ask "what's the weather like" and I say "Its raining" and we're playing in a system where I've been granted the authority to make that determination, and you now accept that its raining...then a decision has been made.  The question is how did I arrive at the answer of "its raining".<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe we're playing in a published scenario and on this day in the adventure the scenario says "its raining".  So I'm just passing on information that was decided by Designer Fiat.<br/>\nMaybe I rolled on a table of possible weather in a game where the rule is "if the players ask what the weather is, then roll on this table"...again Designer Fiat to use the table.<br/>\nMaybe the table is one I made up and chose to use in which case it would be my GM fiat to use the table.<br/>\nMaybe I just said "its raining" simply because I wanted it to be in which case the whole decision was made by GM fiat.<br/>\n<br/>\nClearly I only have the authority because you allow me to (just as the scenario book or rules book only has authority because we allow it to) but as long as everyone so allows that authority is real and decisions made by me where I don't consult any other authority are fiat.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is this interesting?  Because from here we can see and identify lots of different patterns of how to use fiat in a game.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike:<br/>\n"What's the weather like"<br/>\n"I don't know, you tell me"<br/>\n"Its bright and sunny"<br/>\nWhere I use my authority to decree that you shall determine the weather, and using that authority you decree its nice outside.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr<br/>\n"What's the weather like"<br/>\n"I don't know, lets have a secret vote"<br/>\nWhere I use my authority to decree that no one person will decide the weather but we all will by the mechanism of voting.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr<br/>\n"What's the weather like"<br/>\n"I don't know, let's talk about what would make things most dramatic for the story"<br/>\nWhere I use my authority to decree that we're going to arrive at a consensus for the weather but we're going to do so using the criteria of story drama<br/>\n<br/>\nAll games apportion fiat authority in some fashion, but many do it radically differently.  Mouse Guard for instance has a very high ratio of decisions being made by fiat...but its done in a very unique way, its a great example of trading off GM fiat and Player Fiat with a healthy helping of Designer Fiat thrown in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188726/#Comment_188726" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T16:27:38+00:00" title="January 16, 2009  4:27PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So..."Fiat" = "Authority"?

I think the problem is with GM judgement.<br><br>It's pretty clear that the GM's authority comes from the group as a whole. And usually this works pretty well. It's always useful to have a final arbiter to resolve things, otherwise there isn't really any way of doing it except through compromise. If you can compromise, then you possibly don't need a GM to resolve this kind of thing (but you might for other reasons such as plot development, playing NPCs, creating surprises and mysteries). There are also other methods of resolving differences that use some kind of currency as decided by the rules, typically tokens or dice rolls.<br><br>So the GM is not indispensible for resolving differences, you can do that in other ways.<br><br>But if the GM's judgement is called into question you've got a problem. It's much easier to argue with a person than it is with a rule. There are no personal feelings or attacks with a rule (unless perhaps you've got the designer to hand, in which case you can call their judgement into question, and playtesting is designed to do this, to avoid it in play with finished rules).<br><br>So the players give authority over certain parts of the game to a GM or the rules or each other. I don't think any of these are poisonous or anti-player. They're just ways of playing the game. If the game ends up in continuous arguments between players and GM then you need to look at the way the social contract is working or the way the GM is exercising their authority, i.e. their judgement, or the way the players are reacting to the judgement. It's not anything that can't be sorted out between reasonable, and reasoned, people.<br><br>The bottom line is that this giving over of authority always exists in these games. It's also part of the fun. Without the constraints, you tend to move away from what many people consider a game.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188740/#Comment_188740" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T18:50:42+00:00" title="January 16, 2009  6:50PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>It doesn't?

In my mind it makes fiat hard to define. To me it seems GM fiat is simply when the social contract is such that the buck stops with the G.M. The games rules, your arguments of realism or fairness, and anything else, <em>only matter</em> if the GM decides they matter. So rather than trying to look at a specific instances of play to point at Fiat, you simply need to look at the level of social contract to see it.<br><br>Now how do you determine Fiat from non-fiat? Where does the group look to solve problems? The rules, arguments, consensus, or the G.M? If there's some mechanism for distributed authority then it's not Fiat. If there isn't a mechanism for distributed authority then it isn't. This can be hard to determine perhaps as something that looks like distributed authority could actually be officers of the court vying for the ruling to be in their favor.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188770/#Comment_188770" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-16T21:29:32+00:00" title="January 16, 2009  9:29PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>From that perspective my mind is much, much more accepting of "Player announces action and GM says what happens" as the totality of the system because it is indeed complete in that it treats everything consistently with no need to design new parts mid-game.

Knowledge of the role or roles to play is paramount for a role play director.  In our hobby it is not just the rules and world (or module) knowledge that is paramount to qualify as a good GM.  It is also knowledge of how the roles operate in relation to both the real world and the foundational fictive world or campaign setting.  <br><br>During a ballet rehearsal (a real world role playing exercise) the instructor can say "No! No! No! You're doing it wrong.  Like this!" and show the dancer how to perform the portion of dance.  A GM could do the same, but as learning through role play is more valued than showing by example, we typically don't stop gaming to have the GM show us how it's done. Instead we learn by trial and error.  The GM's expertise in judging the consequences of our actions are only necessary when the rules either do not cover the action under their simulation or the props/set cannot either.  However, by any of these means we gain feedback on whether we performed our role well or not.  If we perform well, we also score points, but those are usually secondary rewards to honing one's skills.<br><br>What I do count as GM fiat is when a GM bases the fictional reality off of no truth at all.  I don't mean the real world as in typical role playing.  I mean a plausible fictive reality to engage with.  For example, if the dance instructor was running a role play of the Tango, but taught their students the wrong steps, then they are at fault.  They do not have fiat over what the Tango actually is.  Role play directors are never without judgment themselves, so it is not entirely under their purview to decide what, for example, a Tango is and what it isn't.  The difficulty with fictional role playing is the role, the society that defines it, and the underlying world itself are entirely fiction.  But just as in computer role play simulation, someone must ultimately choose what the definitive statement of that fictional world and the roles within it will be.<br><br>The bond of trust given at the start of an RPG, in my opinion at least, is the GM isn't going to judge upon bias.  Certainly computer RPGs that offer different options for paying customers versus free play use this to their lucrative advantage.  But in each case (caste? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> there is a uniformity of possible achievement.  Scores are typically ranked based upon whether the character played is paid for or not.  <br><br>In face-to-face RPGs, that bias is potentially hazardous, especially if the bond of trust is never formed.  As role playing originated out of psychotherapy, that trust element was already implicit to the role of therapist.  But even teaching how to be a role play director in those cases meant extra training and practice before ever using it during  session (usually group therapy sessions).  <br><br>For entertainment-based or fictional RPGs, the GM's position requries objectivity.  Trust that the players won't cheat when making die rolls or the GM when making judgments is one of the most important element in RPGs.  It is trust in the GM that they will be objective and not judge without foreknowledge that keeps the act of role playing something more than a trading off of fiat on both sides.  The players are expected to play their roles and the GM to judge appropriately.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_188858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188858/#Comment_188858" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-17T20:31:24+00:00" title="January 17, 2009  8:31PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't get the impression that people who use the word "fiat" mean "decisions made...that I don't like." <br><br>I do think they mean, "using force to make my choices meaningless." If I fire my bow at an orc and say "I kill the orc!" and the GM says, "Don't bother rolling. You hit and kill it!" I don't think that's fiat. Yes, the GM just "let it be done" but you told him exactly what you wanted to happen. In a way, I am the one who "let it be done" and the GM voiced his consent. If he instead said, "No, you gotta roll to hit and do 13 hp damage and stuff," then I wouldn't get mad at him for using GM fiat. He hasn't used force to make my choices meaningless.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
