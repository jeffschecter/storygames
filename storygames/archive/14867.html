Ages ago, for instance, there was an RPG.net thread I saw that turned D&amp;D3e; into a sixties protest game.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore recently, a coment I saw about wondering what kind of ways d20 could be hacked popped up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so, I've been thinking about some kind of Story Games, maybe other places too, d20 hacking challenge! It could be some good outreach to more d20 oriented places, and I'd love to see the d20 get pushed and shoved in all kinds of crazy directions, like Jenskot did <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14865&amp;page=1#Item_10" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, well, I'm a little scared because I've never tried to coordinate anything like this before. And I'd like to gauge interest before I attempted it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking, it would propbably be judged, although I have no prize to speak of, but because systems push stuff in interesting ways, criteria I was thinking about was<br/>\n<br/>\n*completeness<br/>\n*Amount of OGL content used<br/>\n*Compatability with other d20 games<br/>\n*Complete incompatibility with other d20 games.<br/>\n*Innovation<br/>\n*Style<br/>\n<br/>\nJust stuff to make it interesting, and maybe push away from just grabbing the core mechanic and writing something wholly unrelated.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestions?

In general, I would love to see the Story Games community do more with OGL content.<br/>\n<br/>\nPelgrane Press is taking their Gumshoe system and creating a plugin version that works with Pathfinder. I've love to see more of that!<br/>\n<br/>\nFATE is also OGL. You could mix Pathfinder and FATE in different ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a lot of design advice on how to hack OGL content based on running hacks with hardcore D&amp;D; 3.5 and Pathfinder players. For example, XP as reward is a pretty weak motivator. Hit Points on the other hand is killer, especially if you remove healing potions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338113/#Comment_338113" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T17:38:45+00:00" title="August 10, 2011  5:38PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I totally forgot.  I had a campaign idea I called <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/dawnoffire/" rel="nofollow"><b>Dawn of FIre</b></a> - mashing up the post-apocalyptic movie <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reign of Fire</span> and with-the-apocalypse movies like "Dawn of the Dead" or the new "Rise of the Planet of the Apes".  <br><br>The premise is that on a typical D&amp;D world, suddenly the surface is taken over by an enormous number of dragons.  To survive, a band of people seek deep underground areas for shelter.  This means that while you have adventurers coming into dungeons, they are coming in there to find a place to live for themselves and the other survivors coming with them.  For example, gold is worthless - what they will be looking for is food and water.  I thought it could be an intriguing twist on the concept, that I might well adapt for Pathfinder.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338138/#Comment_338138" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T20:57:33+00:00" title="August 10, 2011  8:57PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be interested in participating.

I'd be more interested, almost in having rule source requirements than ingrediants, because i'd love to see what folks could come up with. But ingrediants make good seed material, too, so it could make it easier to write.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea is to be kind of game-chefy. I'm intersted here because A)I've gotten interested in the design of 'Trad style' games and B)I'd like to see how non-trad d20 could get pushed into given some cleverness, and C) It's really too bad how the OGL lets people do all this stuff with the system and it's mostly people's home campaign settings and endless feat lists.<br/>\n<br/>\nJenskot's amazing d20 hackery has been very inspirational to this project, I'd love to see how far we can stretch D&amp;D.;<br/>\n<br/>\nBut yeah, if ingredients were something people want, that could be part of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339463/#Comment_339463" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T11:09:29+00:00" title="August 18, 2011 11:09AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I first saw Wilderness of Mirrors it immediately got added to in my DnD game years ago. Basically, make a skill check compare to a Narrative Control scale like in Wilderness of Mirrors and go from there. Every time a player did something cool or created a complication they got an action point (which was an extra d6 they could roll for anything). Rewarding for good RP worked really well for that group. It was still basically DnD, but played drastically different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark" title="Captain_Thark"><img alt="Captain_Thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/674/nQDB5F77NZR8N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Captain_Thark">Captain_Thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339467/#Comment_339467" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T11:21:51+00:00" title="August 18, 2011 11:21AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *suddenly remembers this thread*<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, stuff like that. Exactly. My idea was seeing if folks would be interested in a more formalized, game-chef style thing where people would try and mess with the d20 system in interesting ways. It's happened on the fringes, it's popped up here and there, but I think there should be more of it. I mean, why not? People have done cool stuff with other open source things before, why not push the limits a bit more?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd still be interested in running such a thing if people would be interested, but I think the 'd20' label on top of the thread might be scaring people away, it seems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
