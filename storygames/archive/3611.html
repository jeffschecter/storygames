Interesting. Could you give some examples of conflicts? That'd really help.<br/><br/>See, I've seen Best Friends work really well. So clearly, somewhere, the idea of "how to play Best Friends well" didn't get communicated by the text.<br/><br/>A couple of things...\n<blockquote>But doing stuff together wasn't really an exciting option. Characters can't help one another face adversity. </blockquote>\nYes...external adversity in Best Friends isn't, in itself, interesting. For example, if someone takes down the big villain, that's not really interesting. (It gets interesting when the external adversity has an effect on the characters' relationships).\n<blockquote>What was not in the rules was that you were trying to win stakes and to do so you either went for the direct approach, challenging other players with their weakest hatreds, or a more subtle goal of drawing out your friend's chips and collect all you can (for a max of five). In trying to accomplish this the game ran cleaner and the challenges got crisp, challenging, engaging and ugly.</blockquote>\nMmm. In my experience, Best Friends doesn't have to be <i>competitive</i> to be fun. The characters are friends, but they have issues with each other. So it <i>does</i> need to stay focussed on relationships between character (which, I'm guessing, is why the competitive thing worked well for you, because competitiveness has that focus on relationships) but it needn't be tooth-and-claw fighting.<br/><br/>So that helps with another point...\n<blockquote>The second issue was a question of sexism...all agreed that the combination of the two - being fiercely competitive and unilaterally supporting negative stereotypes - was just a little too much to make the game fun for them.</blockquote>\n...I don't think it's all about competition and negative stereotypes. It's more about relationships (positive and negative) and, although I've seen stereotypes, they're usually affectionate. <br/><br/>So...by saying all that, I'm not saying Here Is How It Should Be Done. I'm trying to say that there's a particular way of playing Best Friends, which works well, and the text clearly didn't convey to you.<br/><br/>Interesting review. Thanks. I'm sure Gregor will be along shortly.<br/><br/>Oh, wait, you asked for feedback on the review. I'd like more examples of conflicts and some idea of how the game fiction progressed, if possible. Otherwise the style's great.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81204/#Comment_81204" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-14T07:01:49+00:00" title="July 14, 2007  7:01AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don,<br/>I'd like to provide some feedback on your review (only because you requested it, normally I take or leave a review).<br/><br/>I'm assuming the review is for all role-players (that assumption is purely based on my belief that the Story Game community should try to bring in players from all play backgrounds).  If I'm incorrect and the review was written solely for the enjoyment of the community here at Story Games forum, you can stop reading now.<br/><br/>So with that in mind, here is my feedback for the review as it relates to being a review of the game for all gamers.  Its a quick read for the SG community using phrases and concepts they are familiar with (even stated as if the reader knows exactly what scene framing and setting stakes are).  For a trad gamer, the review is incomprehensible.<br/><br/>The review was more of an Actual Play report than a review.  Reading it, I found out how you tried to play it, but I got very little sense of what the game is about, how the mechanics work.  The fact that you felt compelled to add a Relationship Map made me feel as if you were trying to drift the game before you played it, which was an odd thing to read in a review.  There is only a brief description of the most intriguing aspect of the game (IMO) the character generation, where players give each other traits because of their petty jealousies.  I would have preferred a dial-in on this piece plus setting creation.<br/><br/>During the end of the review, you gave some good points for how you would improve the game.  This was the most interesting part of the review for me, it gave me context on why your group had problems with the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81216/#Comment_81216" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-14T09:14:36+00:00" title="July 14, 2007  9:14AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Don<br/>\n<br/>\nMany thanks for the review. I must say that I applaud the speed at which you've done this -- I think it's fair to say that the speed of the reviewing process for RPGs is generally of the order of years -- and so I'm thrilled that you have committed to doing this and completed it in a timely manner.<br/>\n<br/>\nConstructively, for your reviewing, I don't get a sense of what the book looks or feels like. There are small pieces alluded to in the review as it stands but they're not expanded upon. You say it's not complex in presentation and that it reads quickly, but you don't really tell me what's actually in the book, whether the bits are in a sensible order, what the art is like, the book size, etc. As a games buyer I think I would have liked more of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Rich has a good point in that it seems like a drifted AP report in some ways, though I don't object to such things in games reviews -- the open and detailed manner of your AP was excellent (though as Graham noted perhaps you could have detailed a conflict? That then allows me, the reader, to judge how my play style matches).<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe the review could have been split into three parts though: (i) what the book is about and what it physically contains, (ii) how you got on playing the game, (iii) conclusion and points of note.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that was all as someone who enjoys reading reviews and buying games. I guess as designer I ought to make some comment on the content of the review and how your game went.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm in two minds over whether I'm happy your group won't play the game again, or not. In one sense I'm unhappy because, hey, we like to think that we've written something that people will play and have fun with. On the other hand I think I'm glad actually. I get the sense that on many levels: this is not the game for them. And that it is good that this is communicated to other similar groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my view Best Friends is not a competitive game. On the contrary it is a supportive game. It does not in any way sustain conflict with things outside the group, unless that external conflict is reinforced by the group. There is no winning in Best Friends by accumulating friend-chips. Its aim is to allow you to create fun characters, who are simultaneously each other's greatest pillars of strength and also each other's greatest adversity. And with those characters you create stories. They have stuff, but ultimately it's just stuff. They have nonsense, but ultimately it's just nonsense. They have Best Friends, and ultimately they are your Best Friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also deeply believe that the game is not in anyway negative about women. In fact, I would say that the game is, if anything, a cheapshot at men. I'm curious, were any of the players women at all? Did they have a similar impression?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I did sum up what I find enjoyable in the game in the phrase "you and your friends all play girlfriends and try to do stuff together, while secretly hating each other..." but that didn't work for your group, which is fair enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am in the process of putting an Appendix online that details a conflict and I hope that you'll find that handy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again! I'm always glad to see the game reviewed.

I have every intention of making changes to the review based on what readers want to see more or less of.  Not that I would otherwise say that the game was better or worse but to give someone interested in learning more about the game a solid picture of what they are to purchase and to focus on the points that help them make their purchasing decisions.<br><br>Graham, after this post I am going to write another about the sexism we percieved and start a discussion about our conflicts to better inform my review.<br><br>Rich, excellent points in describing the game to non-story-gamers.  I am definately of the camp of "jargon should not be used to explain an experience, rather it should be explained in plain english to get the most complete understanding."  My goals were to write it to be short and accesible and I wonder if those two things might be mutually exclusive.<br><br>As far as not going into exactly how the mechanics work I feel I may have erred on the side of caution.  I find that many of these smaller games, like Mortal Coil, Best Friends and Contenders, I should be brief and suggestive when spelling out the mechanics.  With a more clear review and a few Actual Plays someone may not ever have to buy the game and that is counter to my goals.  I am trying to give an idea on the premise of the mechanics and show how they related to my game play without spelling out exactly what they are.  The goal is to give the reader an experience that sheds some light on what the game is about to make the decision on whether they might be interested in buying it or not.  With a game like Exalted or Weapon of the Gods this isn't a big deal because I'd have to list detailed descritions of charms and lores and hordes of weapon porn and disertations on manga to spoil the game.<br><br>I really am of two minds about this.  I'd love if everyone could help me reason it all out.<br><br>The relationship map.  Now please realize that I am not trying to be defensive of your critique.  I am simply trying to get a better picture of how I should approach my reviewed games.  That being said, I don't see how a relationship map is drift.  It's a tool.  Gregor doesn't go into whether to use pens or pencils on his character sheets.  There are no instructions that the GM should use accents or voice inflections to better bring out an NPCs personality and help players differentiate between them.  Does that mean that if a GM does it's drift?  What if I wanted to make a form that helped me keep track of scenes and their conflicts.  Is using such a devise drift?  <br><br>Gregor, I would be honored if you linked the review to your site.  I hope it will gain a little more meat in the coming days after a little more discussion.<br><br>Thanks again, guys.

So let me try to map out why my players came to the conclusions they did and hopefully I can get them to comment here as well:<br><br>So, after a brief setting description, the game focuses on developing the characters hatreds.  Why do I hate my best friends?  This keyed players into certain dynamics right from the outset.  You can only play girls.  These girls are friends, and all that it implies, yet they have some petty differences they have to work through.  Who's prettier?  Who's tougher?  Who's smarter?  When I asked if this game as written would work if we played as men, we all agreed that it would not.  Now, in my experience, this comes with the prejudices of the players as well.  If you percieve that there are some differences between the genders about these issues then it's your own perceptions that are saying "there is an inequality that is being exploited here."  My players would contend that it was more that there are some underlying stereotypes at play - the negative stereotypes that women are more likely to be petty, vindictive and mean.  They recognized that the stereotype existed, do not agree with the stereotype and thus reacted to say "I don't like what this is saying about women."<br><br>The conflicts described in the book and the conflicts that we had played to some very peculiar ideas for them.   That was the idea that these women could not set aside their petty differences even when important stakes were on the line.  One example in the book was women trapped in a cave and one is keeping another underwater longer than needed to show how much tougher she is.  That's rough and not supportive in any way.<br><br>In what way were your games about being affectionate or about supporting one another?  How was that explored in the mechanics?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81279/#Comment_81279" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-14T21:31:32+00:00" title="July 14, 2007  9:31PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2007 9:33PM by Graham.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mmm.

First of all your characters are built around Hatreds.  I realize that you mean for them to be played out as Envy or Jealousies, but by calling them Hatreds there is naturally a subtle cruelty built into the characters.   <br/><br/>That cruelty (at least in our game) was then highlighted by the conflict resolution system.  Yes, your game doesn't sustain conflict with things outside the group - which means all the conflict is within the group.  To me that's pure competition:  which girl kills the bad guy first, which girl swims through the tunnel without almost drowning, which girl fixes the communication array so we can contact another ship.   Using the system as written means <i>all conflict is competitive</i>.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gregor Hutton</cite>Its aim is to allow you to create fun characters, who are simultaneously each other's greatest pillars of strength and also each other's greatest adversity. And with those characters you create stories.</blockquote>\nThe character creation part was loads of fun and we created some rockin' characters.  But were they "... each other's greatest pillars of strength..."?  During our game I didn't see how that was being played out.  <br/><br/>It wasn't until today, a week after our game and after an evening of my putting thoughts together in order to reply to this post, when I realized one way we could have made our friends our strengths.  Mechanically, when you 'push' you are harnessing an other friend's strength.  If in our conflicts we had described how that was happening (sort of like how a player introduces new traits in a Dog's conflict) we would have been reinforcing our friendships.  But, that isn't how 'pushing' is described in the rules as written, nor did I read anyone's actual play reports before sitting down to the table.  With my blank slate, petty hatreds were just that - hatreds.<br/><br/>Another problem I had with the conflict resolution was the aparent lack of 'helping'.  Today, after reading the book again Eruditus found a helping mechanic as a tiny sidebar on page 14.  If we had realized it was there, I'm certain we would have seen this in play during our game and that would have made the game seem a bit less focused on one-on-one situations.  However, it's still a tiny sidebar and not treated as an important mechanic to you the author.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joanna" title="Joanna"><img alt="Joanna" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joanna">Joanna</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81302/#Comment_81302" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-15T09:17:55+00:00" title="July 15, 2007  9:17AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2007 9:18AM by Joanna.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            edit: deleted repeat post                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81306/#Comment_81306" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-15T09:51:17+00:00" title="July 15, 2007  9:51AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Joanna<br/><br/>Thanks for your reply.<br/><br/>I'm afraid that pure competition in Best Friends is a lost cause, as your group found out. There is no way of 'winning' over the other players in a competitive sense. Everyone has given out and received the same number of Hatreds, and the number of Friend-chips is fixed. When in a conflict you can only push once, so even if you want to win as long as more people push back against you then you can't.<br/><br/>The group you're in played the game competitively, and cruelly, and sure enough the game is not sustainable to that sort of play. I think that is a good thing. I wouldn't want to write a game that encourages you to be cruel and to "win" by screwing your Best Friends at every turn.<br/><br/>I'll try and explain how I see the system as being supportive. When we disagree about what happens next at what point do we stop disagreeing? The rules say that the person with the higher hatred wins (since we effectively as a group gave them that power when we made the characters). We can push to change that and win over the higher hatred. The person with the higher hatred can then push back against that to re-assert their victory. At this point does anyone else in the group want to support one or the other? Once everyone has pushed once or decided not to push the rules say the conflict is done.<br/><br/>When creating these stories when do you choose to support a Friend? Did any of the characters stick up for each other in your game at all? Or were they always finding things to conflict over and disagree about? Did you ever say "Oh! You're the Smart one you'd fix the communication array." or "You're the Toughest and you'd get over the wall quicker than the rest of us."?<br/><br/>Maybe it's a bit like in Dogs when you choose to "Give".<br/><br/>Most games I've played have been quirky and offbeat, with the characters helping and hindering each other to create a fun and impishly humourous story. Sometimes it has been more serious and sharper in tone, and that works too. But normally the cruel portraits have been drawn of the menfolk in the story, who are just Stuff.<br/><br/>I'll probably have an Appendix PDF online on Monday and it has a fairly detailed conflict in it. I'd say that would clarify how I see the system as working, but it sounds like the subject matter and system really aren't for your group, which is fair enough.<br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback, much appreciated.<br/>Gregor<br/><br/>-----<br/>Oh, and just a short note that I forgot to put in earlier -- I don't see a Relationship Map as really a drift, I think there's a line in there that says "Drawing a map of the relationships between everyone can help too." But that's as far as I go to mention it.<br/>-----                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81307/#Comment_81307" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-15T09:58:54+00:00" title="July 15, 2007  9:58AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2007 10:07AM by eruditus.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay so here was the first conflict:<br/><br/>I framed the scene where we were all getting together to see, for the first time, that there was no planet left.  There was some fun role-playing as Matt's character, Tara, regretfully pointed out the ill fortune.  My character flips out.  We figure that my panic attack should somehow threaten the ship in some way.  After some deliberation we come up with the idea that I would be slamming on the "comm controls" in the observation platform we were all on and the holographic displays would distract us from a peice of debris hitting the ship.  Tara is trying to calm me down.  If I succeeded then Tara would miss the signs of the impending collision and something vital would be damaged on the ship like oxygen would start to get vented (cool).  If Matt wins then Tara calms Sabrina down and turns off the hologram in time to avoid the collision (cool).<br/><br/>We tie.  I push to Tara who I think is cooler than me and Matt pushes to Cadence who Tara thinks is cooler than her.  Still tied.  So we dictate that as a tie Tara noticed the giant boulder about to his the ship and at the last minute steers the ship remotely so that the collision affects a non-critical system like the communications array - something that needs to be narrated in future scenes.<br/><br/>This worked well.  It took us a little time to work out how we thought it would be interesting but in the end we were happy with the story there.<br/><br/>In the next scene Cory's character, Alli, wants to fix the array but has no way of getting out there.  Cadence has a designer space suit and offers to help.  Cadence points out that she has to go out (even though she has zero smart) because Alli's hips are too wide to fit in the suit.  So Alli walks Cadence through the procedure.  They bicker appropriately during the scene.  Then it's time to find a conflict.  Both want the array to be fixed but want to be seen as responsible for accomplishing it.  So we figure that if Alli is successful she is able to keep Cadence's bumbling on track long enough to fix the array (cool of zero).  If Cadence succeeds, Alli loses her temper and Cadence is able to figure it out on her own (smart of zero).  Both pushed and again it's a tie, thus we decided that the array did not get fixed (which I though became an interesting variation on the prisoner's dilema (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma</a>).  <br/><br/>Scene after scene went like this.  We didn't see any intriguing way to get out of the cycle where we challenged each other's lowest hatred or inevidably tied.  If we didn't do that then we were just pushing chips around and the mechanics didn't really mean anything (especially since the text never suggested narrarating the effects of pushing or how someone might have helped you).  If another player ever tested Alli's smart of 3 then it would have gone something like "Alli is face to face with the computer monitor and has to figure out the ships password to jack into the security system.  Uh, she succeeds..."  If Alli frames the stakes similarly it's equally flat.  <br/><br/>Now I realized later that a small sidebar (I always expect sidebars to be option rules or clarifications, not actual important baseline rules so I must have glossed over this the first few readings) others could work against Alli if she did this.  Sure it would have been interesting if she made Sabrina look dumb by framing a scene that pitted their smart against one another and the others could have pushed to help Sabrina if they thought Alli's stakes were too high.  At three to zero, or actually four to one with pushes, all three other players could have pushed for a tie.  I am not saying a game about comprimises isn't cool.  I'm just saying that any way I look at it I still see a competitive game about women being mean to one another.<br/><br/>Could someone describe for me an experience you had where this supportive nature you speak of was not at the detriment of another character?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81308/#Comment_81308" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-15T10:08:11+00:00" title="July 15, 2007 10:08AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Don<br/><br/>I'm a bit confused.

Meaningless external opposition can be easily overcome with a push (and that's fine for things like "Oh, I want to buy a house" but you don't have enough Rich, so you just push), it's when its bound up in the Nonsense that it becomes adversity and then it you can find the strengths of the relationships between these characters.<br/><br/>Looking at Alli and Cadence they're actually pretty mismatched across the Hatreds with Cadence having the edge in more of the conflicts.<br/><br/>If it's Pretty then, sure, they're tied. (Alli 1, Cadence 1)<br/>If it's Cool then Cadence wins. (Alli 0, Cadence 1)<br/>If it's Smart then Alli wins. (Alli 3, Cadene 0)<br/>If it's Tough then Cadence wins. (Alli 0, Cadence 1)<br/>If it's Rich then Cadence wins. (Alli 1, Cadence 2)<br/><br/>Whether Alli or Cadence wins, the other can choose to push and win instead. At that point the original winner can push back to re-establish their superiority, or let it go.<br/><br/>If Alli pushes on Tough the chip goes to Cadence (so Cadence might allow Alli to win and get a chip gained), and if Cadence ever pushes on Pretty the chip goes to Alli (so Alli might choose to not push back and just keep a chip in that case). With other pushes the chips go to other characters.<br/><br/>And if they've both pushed once then another Friend can push in on the conflict too and help one of them out.<br/><br/>So a conflict has to be about one hatred, say Pretty, rather than having Pretty of one character matched up against Tough of another for instance.
