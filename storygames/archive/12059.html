At one point, I had actually taken bits from three different systems to cobble together a functional, balanced supers game...to no avail.<br/><br/>Of all that I have seen, these are the notable ones:<br/><br/>Wild Talents/Godlike for the actual power creation. They managed to boil it down to superattributes, superskills, attacks, defenses, and "useful" stuff, leaving the exact details to the individual's imagination.<br/><br/>Scion for dealing with superattributes, as well as a very genre-specific way of dealing with powers. Basically the WOD mechanics, with superattributes adding automatic successes, as well as other abilities. The dice mechanics is also quite possibly my favorite, as it really lends itself to superheroic action. When you are superpowered, you really feel like you can perform amazing feats, while still having that hint of failure to keep you on your toes. (my next mash-up will be a mix of Scion mechanics and Wild Talent powers)<br/><br/>Marvel Super Heroes (a real oldie) for dealing with broad and expansive powers very much in the vein of the comics, and the Karma mechanics are a good way of enforcing and rewarding more heroic action. (unfortunately their Universal Table shows signs of its age...my friends and I just abandoned a Marvel Super Heroes game because it took over two hours to handle what should have been a fifteen minute combat, because we had to keep flipping through the book and looking at the damned Universal Table).<br/><br/>Marvel Super Heroes SAGA system for making characters EXTREMELY easy to make. Seriously. Only Capes lets you make characters faster. And it has a good way of dealing with power stunts, limitations, and weaknesses. The card-based mechanics were kinda broken (not nearly as badly as the SAGA Dragonlance game), but also served as a way for determining durations and events, which was really nice.<br/><br/>I kinda like Capes, though I have never had a chance to play it. But its interlocking system is quite inspired.<br/><br/>Uh, let's see...what else is there?<br/><br/>Silver Age Sentinels (which was one of the inspirations I used in my original Super Hero mash-up, along with the Unisystem rules), until the Wild Talents book came around, had one of the best set of rules for building powers, since they were defined as effects, rather than predefined thematic powers. Still, Wild Talents trumped it. Severely.<br/><br/>Oh, and Mutants &amp; Masterminds offers a ruleset that may not be exceptionally inspirational, but works as a good, generic D20 ruleset that can handle anything from swords &amp; sorcery to full-out superheroes. The only thing I really, REALLY like about it is the damage system. I've run regular D&amp;D that uses the Mutants &amp; Masterminds damage system which makes for a more action-movie style game.<br/><br/>As for DC Universe from WEG...well... they have Batman. And a Catch skill (I say, sarcastically). And rules on using capes (I say, sarcastically, again). But at least it has Batman. (And is soon to be brought under the wing of Mutants &amp; Masterminds, thank goodness)<br/><br/>I have more than a dozen other superhero games, none of which really are worth mentioning (even Chaosium's Superworld was kind of an afterthought, in my opinion).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/%5BDeleted%20User%5D" title="[Deleted User]"><img alt="[Deleted User]" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/%5BDeleted%20User%5D">[Deleted User]</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270010/#Comment_270010" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T00:51:23+00:00" title="May  5, 2010 12:51AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seeing as I'm partial to WoD for dice-based rules, I can highly recommend Abberant and \xc6on: Trinity.

Basically every single power that gave you an attack ability was cross-referenced with every single power that gave you a defensive ability and gives you a modifier for how the two interact.  Note: some powers in V&amp;V had both active defense (ex. shooting bullets out of the air with flame power) and passive defense (ex. an aura of flame that melts bullets before they hit you).

Masterminds for character creation and powers. I like how it encourages you to think about the difference between the effect (snare) and the trappings (webbing, bat rope, growing vines, etc.)<br/><br/>With Great Power for the way that it encourages you to have bad stuff happen to your character so that you can have good stuff happen at the end.<br/><br/>Marvel SAGA for the way that the card mechanic encourages you to be creative and simulates the last ditch heroic effort seen in comic books all the time. To say more; this is actually one of my favorite mechanics of all time. For those unfamiliar with it, instead of dice your randomizer is a hand of cards. They are suited for strength, agility, willpower, intelligence, and DOOM! If you are attempting a strength action and play an agility card the value of the card is added to your strength score. If you play a strength card you add the values and then draw from a common deck and add that value as well. If the card you draw is also a strength card you draw another, until you stop drawing strength cards. This is referred to as trump. But what happens when you are Spiderman and all your abilities have agility as trump, but you are out of agility cards in your hand? Well, then the mechanics of the game force you to be creative. You could just play a non-trump card and hope. Or, maybe you play a strength card and hit the bad guy with a car. Or you play an intelligence card to deceive him so that you can slip out the side door, etc. I think that it really captures how characters react at the end of a fight when they have been pressed to exhaustion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270269/#Comment_270269" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T12:05:39+00:00" title="May  6, 2010 12:05PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a big Truth &amp; Justice fan for capturing that comic-book feel.

Mega-Charisma was devastating with the right setup.<br/><br/>MSH for Power Stunts. Also for the way you gained new powers: use a Power Stunt 10 times and you don't have to pay to use it any more; it's a new power. M&amp;M does Power Stunts better (though the use of Hero Points to buy a feat called Alternate Power), but doesn't explain that nearly as well and doesn't have the learn-a-new-power application.<br/><br/>Godlike for the fact that when someone <i>shoots</i> you in the <i>head</i> with a <i>gun</i>, you fucking <i>die</i>. Wild Talents surpasses Godlike in just about every way. Both have excellent setting advice, with Godlike being more atmospheric and WT being more widely applicable.<br/><br/>GURPS Supers and HERO let you customize absolutely everything. Good for when you want to build <i>precisely</i> the right power. They're effects-based power creation at its most detailed. Again, Mutants &amp; Masterminds probably does it better these days - less fine-tuning, but also less time and less hassle.<br/><br/>Truth &amp; Justice is notable for being one of very few games on this list that has cause-based rather than effects-based powers. (The other is MSH.) You can have powers like "Super-Strength" and then do all the crap that super-strength should let you do, rather than buying dozens of extras/stunts/edges/whatever to let you do it. T&amp;J also has the wonderful "I'll get punched in my Relationship With Aunt May stat" rules, which I cannot recommend highly enough.<br/><br/>I've heard good things about Villains &amp; Vigilantes' initiative system, but really know nothing about it.<br/><br/>I have nothing good to say about Heroes Unlimited.<br/><br/>To my chagrin as a superhero RPG collector, I've never played Capes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nocker" title="Nocker"><img alt="Nocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://sites.google.com/site/angrynocker/_/rsrc/1306682518924/jdr/images.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nocker">Nocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270329/#Comment_270329" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-07T05:51:32+00:00" title="May  7, 2010  5:51AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Capes in fan-tas-tic !<br/><br/>Since I discovered it, I never played another S-H rpg.

Successive actions happened on each 15th (10th? it's been a while) phase after that.  So A fast character would act on 53, 38, 23, and 8.
