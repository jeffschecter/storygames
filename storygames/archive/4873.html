There's a whole year to go until the event, so there's plenty of time for things to be decided and whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not me organising it, but I live close (ish) to the venue and know the guy who's doing most of the work.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's aimed as small(er) press publishers and gamers who want something slightly off the mainstream.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen: Friday 7th November till Monday 10 November 2008 - 3 day event with on site accommodation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere: Holbourn/Naish i.e. same venue as Conception.  This is a great venue and pretty ideal for this sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrices are TBA, but if Conception is anything to go by it's likely to be of the order of 200 for a really nice 4 room (6 bed) lodge or \xa3100 for a 2 room (3 bed + sofabed) chalet.  (Having said that, those are the conception prices which are for 5 nights. Might be less for just 3?) Plus of course, whatever if costs you to get to Dorset on the south coast.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you're in the UK (or want to travel to the UK for this event) please come along!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're a publisher from outside the UK, this might be a good time to think about if you'll be represented there and how.  I mean, you can probably get a fan to turn up and demo your game if you ask nicely enough.  You've got a year to plan though, so don't panic.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
