Gary Hobson gets tomorrow's newspaper today.  Jaye Tyler hears animal knick-knacks giving her advice.  Ned the Piemaker can bring the dead back to life for one minute.  Usher's mad crime of burying his sister alive literally tears his house in half. The Red Death manifests itself physically when the contagion can't enter the palace. Early "Dial H for Hero" was also like this, with only one superhero (albeit a magically empowered superhero who didn't know what powers he would have until the right moment) in the whole world.<br/><br/>This has some connections to magical realism, but in much of that genre, magic suffuses the real world thoroughly.  (It's not just that Remedios ascends into the sky while folding laundry, Melquiades dies in Singapore but is too lonely while dead, so he comes back to his family, Pilar lives to be 145, and so on.) <br/><br/>Some challenges I see for gaming are:<br/><br/>- Often the magical effect revolves around one person. Spotlight time is difficult to apportion. Close ties must be bought into and worked, sometimes past the point of plausibility ("You gave the paper to Chuck again?!")  <br/><br/>- The creation of new material around the magical effect is difficult to sustain over even a modest campaign length.  In particular, much of the fun of the technique is following the ever-widening effects of just a tiny touch of magic, which requires a high degree of planning and investment.  ("Lick the light switch!")<br/><br/>Some good things I see for gaming include:<br/><br/>- In the "extended" versions of this, such as comics and TV, the characters often screw around with the magic effect in the same ways gamers always do - Jaye tries not to listen to the animals, Gary tries to throw the paper away, changes things in the paper, tries to play the stock market with it, and so on.  This actually adds to the fun, and shows depth and curiosity on the part of the characters. Curiosity and exploration are a big part of these subgenres, even the horror ones don't come to any kind of conclusion until the character understands the drive behind the horror.  Samara haunts you because her mother drowned her in a well - OH NO WAIT her mother drowned her in a well for haunting people and killing them with her mind.<br/><br/>Any thoughts on this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_206846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206846/#Comment_206846" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-12T00:24:13+00:00" title="May 12, 2009 12:24AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like this idea, Jason!

They don't understand the magic thing fully, and they usually have no resources beyond direct experimentation to work out the rules that apply to it.  Most of them ask the question "Why ME?" and are torn between a sense of responsibility (to use the magic thing wisely and well) and a desire to be normal.  The one-magic-thing story is a personal story, dealing with desires and obstacles on a personal level: if you have the one magic thing, you don't topple world governments or reshape societies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg" title="madunkieg"><img alt="madunkieg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/madunkieg">madunkieg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206992/#Comment_206992" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-12T19:08:51+00:00" title="May 12, 2009  7:08PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another possibility is that the one magical thing isn't inanimate, but something that can act of its own accord, such as a person or creature.

This may seem blatantly obvious, but some rpgs are so caught up in individualism that they don't actually have such rules!<br/><br/>Okay, more ideas, but not necessarily as good ones:<br/><br/>- The "thing" requires everyone in the group working together to activate. There are some hooks that could come out of this, but it could easily go horribly, horribly wrong. Less stringent cooperation (needing only some of the group) might work a bit better, but brings back some of the spotlight problem.<br/><br/>- The magical "thing" is really there to be symbolic more than useful.<br/><br/>- 2 participant (1 player + 1 gamemaster) rpg<br/><br/>- the thing is a responsibility, so they have to keep it, but it causes problems, not benefits, so it gets passed around                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207003/#Comment_207003" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-12T21:11:55+00:00" title="May 12, 2009  9:11PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2009 9:18PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: madunkieg</cite>If the magical "thing" acts of its own volition, then everybody gets a chance to react to it and it can move from person to person as you need to give attention to different PCs.</blockquote>\nYou know, looking at source material like "Early Edition," this is something that seems to be a feature of the one magical thing: it's not something that you choose to get, it's something that chooses you.<br/><br/>Of course, in TV shows you have to have a star, so generally once the main character gets chosen, the thing is his forever.  But there's no reason that the thing couldn't choose again, and again, and again, at whatever pace best suits the game.  (And sometimes the thing DOES choose again on TV -- Eli Stone from the show of the same name had visions that guided him to take on cases that would make the world a better place, up until the season finale where he decided he didn't want them anymore.  And then his brother got the visions instead, along with the potentially fatal aneurysm that went along with them, until Eli volunteered to take the burden back on himself.  That's how things go with the One Magic Thing: if it chooses you, it's because you're the kind of guy who'll keep it.)<br/><br/><br/>I totally dig the "cooperation required" concept, too.  Usually whoever has the one magic thing needs a lot of help and guidance and support to actually accomplish anything -- Gary had his friends, Ralph had his friends, etc. -- but making the thing's mojo itself require multiple characters, that's a nifty idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207037/#Comment_207037" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-13T05:20:50+00:00" title="May 13, 2009  5:20AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jason</cite>How does the "One Magic Thing" differ from a Shock?</blockquote>\nThat's what I was thinking.

It's implied right from the start of that show that there's a LOT more than one magic thing going on in the life of one person. TONS of people have this magic thing and it's a giant problem. It's about midway between the science fiction idea of a technology that has impact on the whole of society and what I'm talking about here - it doesn't affect everything, but it's a lot more widespread than one thing. <br/><br/>When I say one thing, I literally mean one thing.  Greatest American Hero - there is one alien super-suit, that's it, in all the world there is only one.  If Heroes was like that, with one and only one person having powers, that would be what I was talking about.  <br/><br/>If a second person is introduced who has some Magic Thing going on, it's a huge plot twist or just something else that our protagonist has to deal with.  See Joan of Arcadia's second season, or when Gary Hobson meets "the New York guy", the guy who gets tomorrow's New York Times today.

As you suggest the exaggerated-ness of the power is important, but that is only because in our society there is almost no amount of individual, personal power that can give one true, unlimited <i>agency</i>. I think from this perspective -- which is definitely not the only angle on the concept -- what the One Magic Thing does is that it forces the character(s) to take on a level of agency that most people simply cannot handle. (The 'counter to reality' otherness is important because it means the power has not already been accounted for by the existing power structure -- it's not the same thing as, say, becoming President of the United States, because even though you are not currently President there <i>is</i> currently a United States, and all its power relations will remain in place no matter who takes over.)<br/><br/>Now agency doesn't actually mean responsibility, it's just that that's where our society tells us to take it (with great power comes great responsibility? Um, not really, no.) The way the One Magic Thing forces change is simply by giving the protagonists enough power that their actions have real, obvious consequences. This is already true of everyone of course but our society has been built in part to allow us to hide this fact from ourselves. <br/><br/>Being able to know the future or kill anyone by looking at them funny reminds you that what you do actually matters, and for most people that requires a significant shift in perspective. I mean imagine, for example, that one day Superman got even more ridiculously powerful. It wouldn't matter. He wouldn't change at all, he'd just be Super-er-man. He'd be more effective, sure, but that's the thing -- he's already effective. Superman never gets to hide behind not being powerful enough -- all his most meaningful struggles are with figuring out what to do, not whether or not he can do it.<br/><br/>(It may be useful to consider this same dynamic in relation to say, Dogs in the Vineyard.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207712/#Comment_207712" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-16T08:27:48+00:00" title="May 16, 2009  8:27AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>The way the One Magic Thing forces change is simply by giving the protagonists enough power that their actions have real, obvious consequences.</blockquote>\nIn the case of Gary Hobson, the newspaper doesn't grant him power so much as it <i>directly</i> makes obvious the consequences of how he's already acted or failed to act.  It is up to him to figure out what was done wrong, what must be done to make things right, and how he can go about doing that using his own powers and sensibilities.  Everything but the knowledge of the consequences comes from him.<br/><br/>Aren't there also cases where the OMT makes the consequences obvious by <i>taking away</i> power from the protagonist?

Even killing himself (repeatedly!) doesn't change anything about his situation. He can't affect the world at all in any fashion that lasts more than the day. Ultimately, this serves to highlight the consequences of his actions on himself, thus causing him to grow and change. By the end, he's going around doing nice things for people without any expectation at all that it makes a difference - every day, he saves the kid who falls out of the tree. Every morning, his action the previous day is rendered moot as far as the kid is concerned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207725/#Comment_207725" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-16T11:39:02+00:00" title="May 16, 2009 11:39AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great insight, Eric.
