For example <b>Tale</b>, a fantasty rpg with some very interesting illustration and a solid project design. Though in conversation with fans of fantasy rpgs <b>Low Fantasy Gaming</b> is well worth having a look. Well, and I consider the design the game <b>Queste</b> nice.<br/>I am not as much smitten by the looks, but by the science fiction setting and game system of <b>Termination Shock</b> by Greg Stolze. The setting should be accessible to new players and the idea to read several information from one roll, looks enticing. I am considering backing it. <b>Nibiru</b> is more to my taste in visually, yet the system isn\u2019t exactly what I am looking for, though I do think it is working and solid. Check it for yourself.<br/>I found it difficult to categorize the two games which I sorted under \u201eRPG-adjenct games\u201c. On the one hand there is <b>Situations</b>, which sees players collaboratively creating a story, though without feeling like an actual rpg or even story game rpg. <b>The Noticeboard</b> is somewhat of a more traditional boardgame, yet according to its creator, with quite some options to utilize it for tabletop rpg.<br/>Next to those I got somewhat intrigued by <b>Into the Wyrd</b>, a horror setting for D&amp;D.  With <b>Nile Empire</b> you\u2019ll find a supplement for Torg and <b>Vagabond\u2019s Cyclopedia</b> one for Vagabond\u2019s of Dyfed.<br/>Though there are many, many more supplements, adventures and other cool projects:<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>2 Science Fiction Role-Playing Games<br/>2 RPG adjenct games<br/>3 Settings<br/>2 Supplements<br/>4 D&amp;D Supplements<br/>5 Adventures<br/>8 Dice Projects<br/>2 Apps &amp; Tools<br/>2 Card Projects<br/>2 Notebooks<br/>3 Maps &amp; Tiles<br/>1 Various RPG Project<br/>2 Various Games<br/><br/><b>Spanisch Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Adventures<br/>1 Map Project<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>3 Role-Playing Games<br/><br/><b>Italian Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/><br/>Blog-Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/12/09/crowdfunding-collection-89/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2018/12/09/crowdfunding-collection-89/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teylen" title="Teylen"><img alt="Teylen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teylen">Teylen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479389/#Comment_479389" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-31T11:55:03+00:00" title="December 31, 2018 11:55AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I present to you the new <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/12/31/crowdfunding-collection-90/" rel="nofollow">Crowdfunding Collection no. 90, including every tabletop project started between 12/09 till 12/31</a>.<br/><br/>Welcome to the last Crowdfunding Collection of 2018.<br/>In regards of the projects I am enticed by <b>They Came from Beneath the Sea!</b>. The game offers a pulp SF setting along the movies and narratives of the 50s. I had the chance to play the game during GenCon and it was quite some fun, plus I do consider the author very reliable. Thus I recommend it even though I couldn\u2019t yet squeeze it into my budget.<br/>If you would rather prefer fantasy games you might like to check out <b>Map Maker Adventures</b>. Fans of a more fantastical Rome should take a look at <b>Maelstrom Rome</b>.<br/>In regards of game books you\u2019ll find that <b>Choose Your Way Micro Action Booklets</b> does offer some small adventures. While I personally felt tempted by the <b>Silent Titans</b> OSR adventure.<br/>If you fancy a look across the plate, maybe check out the <b>Record of Dragon Wars</b> project by the German Uhrwerk publisher. It\u2019s their take on a Record of Lodoss Wars setting, with a OSR inspired rule set. Fitted to be suited for beginners.<br/>There are plenty more projects to take a look at, thus go forth and slide comfortably into the new year.<br/><br/><b>German Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/><b>English Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>4 Role-Playing Games<br/>1 Gamebook<br/>3 Supplements<br/>4 Adventures<br/>4 Dice Projects<br/>2 Coin &amp; Token Projects<br/>1 Enamel Pin<br/>1 Soundscape<br/>3 Various RPG Projects<br/><br/><b>Spanish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>2 Role-Playing Games<br/><br/><b>French Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Gamebook Collection<br/><br/><b>Swedish Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Role-Playing Game<br/><br/><b>Italian Crowdfundings</b><br/><br/>1 Setting<br/><br/>Article: <a href="https://teylen.blog/2018/12/31/crowdfunding-collection-90/" rel="nofollow">https://teylen.blog/2018/12/31/crowdfunding-collection-90/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
