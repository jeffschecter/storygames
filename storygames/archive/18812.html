But it's something that's got my mind abuzz a bit since reading through Pathfinder for a game that's starting up soon.<br/><br/>The most engaging element of the system, for me, is the fact that it follows <i>Magic: the Gathering</i>'s "Golden Rule" (the same rule also followed by CCGs): "specific cards trump the general rules of play". The entire game is premised around the fact that there's a relatively simple set of core rules, and a large number of specific options which bend those rules in different ways. Playing Magic means that you can find ways in which those rules combo, and that's where the fun of the game is--in building and then playing out a deck designed to synergize and defeat an opponent. It's one of the reasons, I think, that I hopped into messing around with CCGs--you bring together a diverse collection of abilities that click into a cohesive "engine" that does what you want it to.<br/><br/>It's also cool, because so long as everyone's on the same page, you can play a CCG at a high-tier competitive level, but you can also play it on a casual level that still makes use of fun combos--it's just not completely optimized.<br/><br/>The way I see it, 3.5 and Pathfinder scratch that same itch, but allow for more character flexibility, and for the introduction of a story element. They let you build a deck <b>that has character and story</b>, not limited to the narrow goals of a card game, and that's pretty cool in my mind. I definitely notice that 4th Edition cut down on the "intricate combo" aspect, in favor of giving character options more raw power. Being effective is no longer a matter of finding the right tricks, but rather of finding the right bonuses to make you effective. It's an interesting shift, not objectively worse, just not as much to my preference.<br/><br/>(On the other hand, 3.P's major flaw is that the "combos" which define many caster classes overshadow the other combos and render them redundant. That's its biggest flaw, and it's a pretty big one, and that's the one thing I'd love to see fixed about it. A lot of this observation is along the lines of "3.P is theoretically like this, but in reality...it falls short of the ideal".)<br/><br/><i>Mythender</i> is the only indie game I've actually played which delves into the concept, with various Gifts giving you different abilities, letting you stack and combo them together for better effect. I hear <i>Anima Prime</i> is a bit similar in that regard.<br/><br/>Any other games out there I should know about? For this purpose, I'm not so much interested in something like Fate; I love Fate, but Stunts are meant to be taken in isolation, ways of giving you small bonuses in specific situations. It's very good at character diversification and specialization, but that's not really the niche I'm wondering about.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421542/#Comment_421542" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-16T08:35:58+00:00" title="September 16, 2013  8:35AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought you were going to talk about games based on "do unto others\u2026" (the Golden Rule)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421543/#Comment_421543" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-16T08:58:17+00:00" title="September 16, 2013  8:58AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2013 8:58AM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I thought you were going to talk about games based on "do unto others\u2026" (the Golden Rule)</blockquote>\nHaha, yeah.

It's basically the game that pushes this principle through a couple of envelopes in the service of dramatic storytelling. That's at least why I'm fascinated with the game, that it takes the 3rd ed. D&amp;D principle of localized rules (localized into individual character builds, specifically) and lets players loose to do whatever with it. Most importantly: unlike 3rd edition D&amp;D in its fruitless quest for "game balance", TSoY mandates that it is up to the campaign to <i>discover</i> where the game balance lies: whichever combination of the legos proves supreme, whether it be half-ogres with spiked chains or whatever else, that's the story we are telling now, how the half-ogre and his chain saved the world. It helps immensely that there are no "builds" in the game, so that whatever discoveries you make about combining various rules, it'll necessarily happen at least mostly in play, through play, for play, instead of being a vapid exercise in armchair wish-fulfillment. (Yes, I have Opinions about 3rd edition D&amp;D...)<br/><br/>In a more general vein, almost all games that feature localized subsystems necessarily play by the rule that specific-trumps-general; it's just CCGs where an idiot-proof rules-writing paradigm has taken root. I mean, I haven't heard anybody suggest that e.g. FATE characters shouldn't be able to use their special knacks because those knacks break the rules. Of course following the "Golden Rule" doesn't mean that these games have too much in the way of combo friendliness; in that regard I can't think of a game better than TSoY.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/XanatosChimera" title="XanatosChimera"><img alt="XanatosChimera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/XanatosChimera">XanatosChimera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421548/#Comment_421548" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-16T09:49:20+00:00" title="September 16, 2013  9:49AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Apocalypse World kind of does this with Moves, right? </blockquote>  I haven't read Apocalypse World, but from the descriptions, yeah, the Moves seem to parallel the function that 4e's Powers have.

Sometimes it's like "when you Speak Truth To A Mob, trigger this move." Of course anyone can speak truth to a mob, but only you get to trigger a move and therefore have more control.<br/><br/>However, the moves are usually Big Deal things that aren't necessarily made to set up character builds and combos, if that's what you're looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421555/#Comment_421555" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-16T11:45:32+00:00" title="September 16, 2013 11:45AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't read TSoY <b>yet</b>.

But they're not exactly what they're looking for. Scrape is right about *World games--the moves are varied, but they're all distinct entities for specific circumstances. Cortex Plus sorta has it, but Distinctions and Abilities and such are rather independent; they're a form of hyper-specialization that lets a character have access to particular things. In my experience, they don't generally work in tandem, though I could be wrong. (It's more or less similar to Fate--I like the game, but it doesn't fit <i>this</i> niche for me.)<br/><br/>4E is probably a good example of how tight my calibration is on this; I don't consider 4E to quite fill the same niche. It shifted in two strong directions. One, it's less about finding cool combos and more about picking options that out-and-out give you raw power. Two, more of the tactics are in the middle of play, as opposed to having a good portion of the tactics and game during character build. 4E is, in my mind, <i>almost</i> there but not quite there.

I'll accept as true that you believe Magic's creation of specific trumps general is better than D&amp;D 4e.  I don't accept it as true as an objective assessment.  I'm not sure what the substantive difference in creating new powers and creatures for a CCG is from creating new powers and creatures for an RPG is, in any case.<br/><br/>The second two you list as differences are true, but incomplete.

The Tiefling's Dimension Door is an example where you can use it to reposition yourself.  Positioning influences bonuses later on, but there's nothing that says you can't use it to take yourself out of the line of fire instead, gaining no bonuses but avoiding an Opportunity Attack.

Although why the Bard can slide an enemy that missed an ally and not the bard doesn't quite make in-game sense either... unless there's some restriction on proximity for that power.  Why should the bard be able to slide the enemy one target if the miss occurred 10 feet away from the bard's position?<br/><br/>Under D&amp;D hit-points are usually presented as an aggregate of one's ability to defend oneself.  A bard trades on inspiring and rallying allies with tunes and song, so taken that abstract idea of hit-points, this actually makes in-game sense for the bard.  The bard encourages and inspires the ally with a song or chant or whatever, and the ally in question rallies and fights better for a while.<br/><br/>C again makes in-world sense for a bard.  When the bard lands a hit he taunts and angers the enemy in to focusing on the bard meaning the bard's allies have a better situation to score hits on that creature.<br/><br/>Now, if your example A. stipulated the enemy being slid has to be adjacent to the bard, then it's an interesting power, and it makes sense in-world.<br/><br/>Magic has the same thing: <br/>When X occurs select an opponent's creature and tap it (example A)<br/>When one of your creatures goes to the graveyard this creature gains (+X/+Y), (example <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/><br/><br/>So, I don't think I'm missing your point.

"A" is good because it changes the basic rules. Normally, you can only move yourself. "A" breaks that.<br/><br/>The benefit of this, design-wise, becomes more obvious if you instead look at these powers as if the opponent have them. A big monster is attacking the party. You will learn during combat that it can move one of you once per turn. This is something you will have take into consideration and adapt to. The monster also have combat advantage (+2) against you all the time. This does nothing. At all. For anyone. The monster itself could had started with two extra in attack instead. You will never notice it. The power gives no ripples. No synergy. It's bad design. Sloppy. Lazy. If you instead had a power that granted combat advantage and another person had a power that makes the opponent prone (=can't move) if it grants combat advantage, then those powers got synergy. They coexist. Then "C" is good.<br/><br/>Incrementalism is the lazy man's design. Designing for breaking the basic rules isn't. Giant Growth in Magic is a +3/+3 instant. It's can be used as a reaction to the other person's move - and both knowing that creates a synergy between the two players' actions. If GG were instead a sorcery, then it would be a badly designed card. Pure incrementalism. Designing Magic cards is to design with synergy between the cards but also the players, and that takes effort.<br/><br/>And that kind of thing is what I think <b>CarpeGuitarrem</b> is after.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421573/#Comment_421573" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-16T15:15:02+00:00" title="September 16, 2013  3:15PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The board gamer in me is itching to point out that Cosmic Encounter did that first. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>On a more serious note, isn't this really just a question of presentation?

One example, for instance, was a Rogue talent that let you put a bleeding effect on your Sneak Attack. You normally deal damage when you hit someone with an attack. Bleeding continues to damage them at the start of a round. (Furthermore, it also interacted with the number of Sneak Attack dice you had, which lets you involve another facet of the rules. Which in its own way is incremental...but...it's still different, in a way.) I like the idea that there's a lot of hooks in the game, that you can deliver a vast array of effects which all can be acted upon and otherwise leveraged.<br/><br/>Making better use of conditions, for instance, might be an example of this.<br/><br/>Upon musing: a *World game could do this, if you could chain together moves--one result of Move A triggers Move B, one result of Move B triggers Move C, and the result of Move C is probably very, very good. But that more or less runs counter to the spirit of the game, because it's so incredibly intricate.

All about "finding the right bonuses"? Have any of you ever even played a controller, or (especially) a defender? Or built an effective party with two or even three defenders? I mean, I guess if you have, and that's how you played it, it would not be very satisfying. But there's quite a bit more to 4e than stacking +x, +y, +z to damage or whatever.<br/><br/>It's true there are unexplored design frontiers of 4e. Powers that make use of counters never existed, for example, but there's no reason they couldn't.<br/><br/>But I think, really, to some extent we're comparing apples and oranges. 4e is cooperative, MtG is competitive. 4e is designed with a view to making sure everyone has a fair chance to participate. A lot of effort went in to ensuring there are no crazy out-of-control game-breaking Pun-Pun type combos, and PCs of the same level are all generally within a certain margin of effectiveness in their roles. At the same time, the goal of 4e encounters is very simple: get the enemies down to 0hp as quickly as possible, keep your own side above 0hp as long as possible. The strategic fun is all about how you do that <i>as a team</i>, and what happens before you get there.<br/><br/>MtG is designed with a view to making sure players can sometimes win, sometimes lose, and that they can get better at winning by building a smarter deck. It's totally okay for there to be some super-powerful combos, as long as they can sometimes be countered or disrupted. A player should be able to completely dominate <i>sometimes</i>, as long as the opponent can feel like it's fair, like if he got better at the game, or had a better deck, or even slightly better luck of the draw, he might have had a shot. (Sorry if I'm talking out my buttinski here\u2014I have only a little experience with MtG, and more with 4e.)<br/><br/>So, I mean, I think it would be helpful to evaluate games partly with a view to those sorts of considerations, and whether their use of power combos contributed effectively to an overall view of design and gameplay.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421647/#Comment_421647" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-18T11:19:49+00:00" title="September 18, 2013 11:19AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's worth pointing out that 4ed shouldn't be a target here, and no one should feel like they have to defend it or anything.

Because you've got the wrong tools for fixing it; making them more effective just makes things worse.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421894/#Comment_421894" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-24T21:06:33+00:00" title="September 24, 2013  9:06PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 24, 2013 9:07PM by Scrape.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not about the +3s, those are just bonuses, not <i>combos</i>. A combo is, like, the Battlebabe's Dangerous &amp; Sexy, with Impossible Reflexes, and then take the Skinner's An Arresting Skinner. So if you're threatened, you start stripping. Enemies can do nothing but stare at you. While they're staring, you make eye contact. <i>That</i> triggers your Dangerous &amp; Sexy and now they can't break eye contact and you're nearly naked, which gives you +Armor from Impossible Reflexes.<br/><br/>Now <i>that's</i> a <i>combo</i>, a series of moves interacting and triggering off one another to be more than the sum of their parts, and not just giving a higher number to your roll. So yes, they exist in AW, but not to the degree that the system is built around them, y'know? There's only so many Moves and it seems like we're after a game with <i>lots</i> of them, yeah?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_421896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421896/#Comment_421896" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-24T21:17:43+00:00" title="September 24, 2013  9:17PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, defs!<br/><br/>AW has lots of combos because of 1) simple core mechanics and 2) fiction first. I.E. <i>Moves Snowball</i>. But even the example you gave still just makes you good at: fucking people up, or maybe fucking with people. What the postapoc needs isn't better sociopaths, but like, community-builders.<br/><br/>It's just that what you usually need in AW is shelter from the snow, not an avalanche. <br/><br/>So, combos are really neat but my point is how meaningful they are is relative to their ability to help you achieve your goals as a player. So, sure, AW has lots of combos for "kill a dude" but not really any combos for "make a community peaceful and resilient." <br/><br/>[don't get me started on the Solace and the Touchstone]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_421919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/421919/#Comment_421919" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-25T08:39:32+00:00" title="September 25, 2013  8:39AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I keep forgetting how flippin' tight Apocalypse World is designed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422189/#Comment_422189" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-30T06:34:20+00:00" title="September 30, 2013  6:34AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to hear about the Solace and the Touchstone...
