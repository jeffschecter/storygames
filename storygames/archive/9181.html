In fact, it's pretty safe to say that with my local group, if we're not playing a GM-less game, I'm the GM.  Heck, I'm even the GM (in the sense of the person who teaches the game and will probably be the deciding factor if there is a rules dispute) even for GM-less games.<br/><br/>I don't like giving out experience.  It would probably be okay in versions of D&amp;D when experience is awarded for very straightforward, by-the-book things.  You killed this monster you get 100 xp.  Easy.<br/><br/>But for the traditional games I usually get into, like White Wolf's stuff, the xp is handed out at the end of a session, and it's supposed to be based on crap like whether someone "roleplayed well."  I hate that.  I hate feeling like I'm judging that kind of thing.  I often end up copping out by just giving the same lump sum of xp to everyone at the end of every session.  But that's boring.<br/><br/>I've never played TSoY but I've always loved the idea of Keys.  So I was wondering, has anyone ever used Keys to replace "traditional" xp systems, like that in White Wolf's games?  If so, how did it work?  Were there any problems?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203143/#Comment_203143" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-22T12:10:13+00:00" title="April 22, 2009 12:10PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The xp system is a mess in those games in the first place, I wouldn't give out xp at all. By this I mean, the notion of characters being developed via a reward cycle resource makes no sense for the goals of the game (as I understand them).<br/><br/>WW games <i>do</i> presume developing characters though (characters progress in the social structure by gaining power), so what I'd do would indeed be either a key system (and accepting that I am not actually playing a WW-style storyteller game anymore, but rather something character-driven) or just doling out advancement based on in-setting facts. The latter goes hand to glove with what most Storytellers seem to be trying to do with the game, so I imagine it's mostly player expectations that are holding them back from just saying that for this next part your character gets two new dots and five new powers due to the time-jump or whatever.<br/><br/>And then there's the chance that the group really just wants to play vampire superheroes, in which case both of the above are stupid ideas. The sort of xp system I'd recommend would be completely dependent on what the group was trying to do with the game.<br/><br/>Also: if you don't like doling out xp based on those sorts of criteria, perhaps you should loosen up a bit. I don't do those games myself anymore, but if I did, I can imagine how I'd make a big show of it and reveled in the unjust powers provided to me by the game's charter. Players would get frank critique of their play during the session, and the best players would accumulate sick amounts of xp compared to the worst. It'd all be in good fun and for constructive purposes, except for when little Joe doesn't appreciate me calling his character an useless cunt, at which point he'll go crying home and my game crashes. But it'll be worth it anyway, it's the best part of GMing when you get to feel like the biggest cock in the roost by hazing the other players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203146/#Comment_203146" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-22T12:12:45+00:00" title="April 22, 2009 12:12PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haven't used it myself, but here's somebody's insights...<br/><br/><a href="http://www.lawfulneutral.com/sweet20/xp.html" rel="nofollow">Sweet20 System</a><br/><br/>I think this sort of assumes a 3.5 edition outlook, as "individual" experience is sort of frowned upon in 4e.

In truth, I see no problem with Keys as long as you can accept not controlling the plot in the traditional manner. It sucks pretty heavily if the GM uses Keys, you get to choose them yourself, but the GM determines what happens in the game so strongly that you can't drive towards those Keys. So combine Keys + player driven game and you're good to go.<br/><br/>Also, consider Key Scenes, those will be majorly useful for players not used to character-driven games. There need be no GM fiat with these, either, especially if you just put down the list of prepared key scenes at the start of a session and let the players drive towards them or not, as they will.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203185/#Comment_203185" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-22T15:08:13+00:00" title="April 22, 2009  3:08PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ludanto</cite>Haven't used it myself, but here's somebody's insights...<br/><br/><a href="http://www.lawfulneutral.com/sweet20/xp.html" rel="nofollow">Sweet20 System</a><br/></blockquote>\nFor what it's worth, a few years back, I ran two D&amp;D campaigns (3rd Edition) using Sweet20 (which hacks TSoY's Keys into D&amp;D). I would call the results mixed to unsatisfying, since adding something like that to a D&amp;D game gums up the works in may ways. (It did, however, get both me and a couple of the players into the idea of playing a more story/character kind of game.)<br/><br/>I think Keys are awesome, and I think they are powerful enough to really change your game. For that reason, I don't think they qualify as just a new way to give out XP. Ideally, if you decide to use them, the players should know what they're getting into and be excited about a new kind of game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203206/#Comment_203206" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-22T18:13:31+00:00" title="April 22, 2009  6:13PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>as long as you can accept not controlling the plot in the traditional manner.</blockquote>Oh god!  i don't WANT to control the plot in the traditional manner!  i'm sick to death of all the "homework" that comes with GMing a game that way.  if i do a traditional game of any sort, it's going to be very player/character driven.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203212/#Comment_203212" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-22T19:26:10+00:00" title="April 22, 2009  7:26PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm. NWoD actually has some explicit conditions for getting XP, not just "Award some number for good roleplaying!" It wouldn't be too hard to turn these into actual keys. "Oh, snap, he's not really a vampire? Pinging the key of Learning." "Man, that was a hard fight. Pinging the key of Danger." Admittedly, one of the things they suggest rewarding is role-playing (but only on a basis of once per session, and they advise to not be "stingy" with it).

The only place that it's really been successful is in the Cthulhu Mythos score and its relation to Sanity in Call of Cthulhu.  That is a pretty sad statement.  Keys are interesting, but there would have to be a very specific set of keys tailored to the specific sort of horror/suspense experience you wanted to create.  I am really not sure, reading:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>.  If someone really wants to play an idiotic coward (and that kind of character isn't ruining the game for anyone else) I think I like the idea of letting him get xp for failing to learn obvious and important truths and avoiding danger.</blockquote>\nthat this is really a feasible thing to expect a horror/suspense game to support.  Cowards in horror/suspense stories are either rogues who are knowingly getting out of Dodge because things are too much, Renfields who join up with the bad guys long enough to stay on their good side, or cannon fodder who panic when the zombies pound on the door.  Of course the development of the idea of cowardice versus fear is a key element of horror fictions too, so I agree with you that there ought to be something there, but I am not sure character-capability-developing XP is what we want to get there.<br/><br/>Have you considered Aspects? "Cowardly Lion" is a great Aspect in FATE - it has both positive and negative elements, and changing that to, say, "Discretion Is The Better Part Of Valor" could mark an important advancement for the character? <br/><br/>Anyway, I would back the heck up and try to think about what you want XP to do in your horror game before you work on the right way to give it out.  A lot of times the "boring lump sum" approach to XP is a good one because it permits the pacing of the introduction of new challenges and new strategies to cope with them.  But it doesn't - can't be expected to - do more than that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_273226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273226/#Comment_273226" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T18:01:15+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  6:01PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread is about a year old by now, so Brian's probably no longer in the market for a xp solution.

Each player had, say, three tokens to spend during play or at the end of the night (as they liked), thereby awarding XP to their fellow players. The effect was, in practice, not terribly unlike Keys. Though, yes, it's subject to abuse and the occasional hard feeling when a player wonders, "Why wasn't that worth XP?" The good thing, though, is that (my) players tended to award XP for things that seriously impacted the character in question, whether it was progress in roleplaying/storytelling goals, or a lesson presumably learned from a real bad (or highly successful) roll. Get no successes on a 13-dice pool and someone was likely to award you an XP for that.<br/><br/>The thing is, this sort of works backwards. The XP award was an implicit statement that this-or-that event should be worked into the character's tale or arc. As a result, it often was.<br/><br/>My play group was pretty good, though, about spending XP on things that either had seen play or as a way of saying, "I want this development to take place 'on screen.'" In my experience, guiding questions and a bit of peer pressure get that done just as well as mechanics. As the ST, ask things like, "How did your character learn that dot?" or "How are we going to explain where this new dot came from?" It works.<br/><br/>I had advancement-by-narrative mechanics I intended to work into <i>Vampire</i> down the line\u2014things that would explicitly give the ST the go-ahead to award Merits largely through play, instead of an XP budget\u2014but I never found a book for them to live in. They weren't much more than guidelines for people to point to and call "official," anyway. <br/><br/>Sorry to hear that <i>Changeling</i> didn't pass muster for you, Nathan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273240/#Comment_273240" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-26T19:12:33+00:00" title="May 26, 2010  7:12PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The premise is fucking amazing and is easily the most interesting thing WW has done with their new line.
