The closest thing to a GM is the episode's current guide, who makes sure all the episode's events occur in the right order. It is not a narrative driven by choice and randomization, like most story/role-playing games; it is a narrative you experience and act out in the first person, and is much closer to a <i>play </i>than a game.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>As an example, in the first episode, the Guide has this on his/her episode sheet (among other things) - the tick box is just for keeping track of how far the episode has progressed:\n<blockquote><i>[ ] Ask participant 3 to read the starting situation.</i></blockquote>\nParticipant 3, who portrays an elderly tailor named Sendel, has this on his/her sheet, and reads it out loud:\n<blockquote><i><b>Starting situation: Read this out loud when the guide tells you to</b><br/>We were woken in the middle of the night by someone pounding on our door. It was the police. They ordered us out of the house. A police inspector waved a paper at us and shouted: "Sign it! You're being deported!" We were put in police cars and driven to the station. I looked out the window while we were driving. The streets were black with people. They cheered and shouted: "Out with the Jews! Go to Palestine!" This morning, on the Sabbath, we were put on the train to Neubenschen, a small place near the Polish border. We haven't eaten for two days. We don't want to eat the German bread. The police are saying we're being sent back to Poland. I don't understand why they're saying "Back". We've lived here for 27 years now! We're Germans, not Poles! Rivka says we have to start a new life in Poland. But I'm tired. I don't know if I have the strength for it.</i></blockquote>\nThe next thing the Guide has on his/her sheet is this:\n<blockquote><i>[ ] Read the following text, and wait for the participants to end the scene before you continue.<br/><br/><b>The German border</b><br/>You get off the train in Benchen, close to the Polish border. The German soldiers tell you to get in line. Everyone in front of you gets searched, one by one. Now it's your turn. Sendel and Rivka, you're standing in front of a German border guard.<br/>Sendel, Rivka and the Border Guard are present in this scene. The Border Guard has the first line. You end the scene with the Border Guard sending Sendel and Rivka on.</i></blockquote>\nSo, at this point, the participants are role-playing freely, and can decide how long they want the scene to last. When they've finished, the guide goes on to the next point.<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>Feel free to post questions on this thread.

I don't know, I'm not a teacher. I'll ask around among my teacher friends and see if they're even still in use.<br/><br/>Fun, kind of. Definitely thought-provoking. This was maybe 7th or 8th grade. There were all kinds of meta-issues having to do with social standing and such among the kids. I couldn't tell if that interfered with the ethics-oriented content of the "game" or if that was indeed part of the game by design.<br/><br/>I remember participating in several, but the one that really stood out for me was a branching choose-your-own-adventure style game based on surviving a nuclear war. The class, maybe 30 kids total, broke up into 6 colonies of 5 kids each. Each of the colonies were fed two things each turn: a situation (different for each colony), read by the "colony leader" (chosen from among the 5 kids by any means necessary -- some took it by social force, others voted) and a "radio update" that was played on, I kid you not, an 8-track. Everyone got the radio update at the same time, and it was the same radio update. This gave everyone context about the outside world.<br/><br/>So on any given "turn" (called months), each colony would have its own thing to deal with. Typical events: you discover your water has been contaminated and the colony will be out of potable water in 3 months; a family of four arrives at the door of your bomb shelter -- they have fresh supplies with them but one of them is sick with a contagion; the weather has cleared enough that you can safely travel to any other colony; men with guns arrive outside your bomb shelter, offering to trade livestock for ammunition. Really wrenching what-if stuff for 7th graders.<br/><br/>I believe there was some method by which the teacher could tie each colony's outcome into the "big picture" for some purpose. Also, the "radio updates" had a potent impact on how we perceived our decisions.<br/><br/>I don't believe there was a win/lose condition to the game. After six months, we came together and talked about the decisions we made. Some colonies went totally Lord of the Flies; others maintained high ethical standards but suffered the worst losses.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Santtu" title="Santtu"><img alt="Santtu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Santtu">Santtu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97510/#Comment_97510" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-19T10:28:37+00:00" title="September 19, 2007 10:28AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now I'm intrigued :) Please if you can find sources post them here. <br/>\n<br/>\nI've wrote few "games" for teaching purposes, first two to 4th graders and 6th graders and the latest for polytechnics (average age was 24, I think).

But the situations you've developed share a lot of similarities to what the more intense/serious "story games" are aiming for. I'm sure you're deriving a lot of value from talking about it here.<br/><br/>Granted, in the big wide world out there there's probably less than 1000 human beings, total, who give even the tiniest shit about Big Model Theory, various warring factions among the main RPG discussion boards, roll v. role, etc. I guess my question boils down to, are you concerned at all that someone will raise a fuss that could damage the success of your project?<br/><br/>(Confession: I still have clear memories of the intense firestorms surrounding White Wolf's "roleplaying game about gas chambers" debacle, and I wonder if there's any way around having that happen again.

That's several questions/issues right there.<br/><br/>First, Story Games. I'm here because this is the most interesting place to talk about role-playing games, for me, right now. The format is looser than at the Forge, but people are more serious about their gaming than at RPG.net. So I'm interested in hearing what people here, as individuals, think about the project. I'm not concerned about whether or not it'll be associated with Story Games or not - I have discussed an earlier incarnation at The Forge; I've also tried discussing it on theRPGsite and at RPG.net; and I've talked about it at Knife fight. So... just because I talk about it here doesn't reflect my thoughts on whether Kristallnacht is a game or not, for instance.<br/><br/>I am concerned that people will raise a fuss, because, frankly, I hate being the center of negative attention, and it will make working on the project stressful for me. However, I've always been aware that the project might be controversial. Right now, though, my point of view is this: If someone has problems with a role-playing piece about the Holocaust... it's actually their problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97860/#Comment_97860" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T11:24:29+00:00" title="September 20, 2007 11:24AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've also spent a lot of time working through my own feelings about this, and I've changed my mind on a wide range of issues. My take on the controversies comes down to:<br/><br/>* Most complaints seem like they boil down to issues of taste (is this tacky? does it pander?), propriety (does making this a "game" trivialize the issue?), and trust (does the designer have any business addressing the issue?). Personally I believe these are all valid concerns any serious designer-slash-designer-of-serious-games must address. I'm sure there's room for reasonable disagreement here.<br/><br/>* There's a full-on hate out there from folks who view this sort of thing as pretentious. Totally invalid issue. Probably no getting around it.<br/><br/>It's a good project, Matthijs. What sort of research have you been able to do into the mindset of the Nazis themselves? I'd be curious about how to write their scripts so they're sympathetic without drawing criticism for being "too kind" or whatever. I married into a family of refugees (new mother-in-law escaped in '43 or so, IIRC) and we've talked some about the national mindset at the time. <br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97873/#Comment_97873" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T11:39:18+00:00" title="September 20, 2007 11:39AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good categorization of complaints, Paul. Personally, I think Kristallnacht is not tacky - but, of course, I can't judge that. I'm certain it's not improper or trivial. Whether I have any business addressing it - whether people can trust me to do it right... Do you really think that's a valid concern? I don't necessarily mean in this specific case, but in general: If someone writes a good novel about a war, should we be concerned about who the author is? I know we <i>are</i>, but I don't know whether we <i>should be</i>.<br/><br/>With respect to the Nazi mindset: I'm focusing on individuals in specific situations; I don't believe it's possible, or even useful, to generalize over a whole group of people. So I'm not trying to portray the Nazi mindset, but I do portray some individual officers and soldiers. They are, however, mostly used as part of a story - the narrative of the Jews deported to Poland, for example.<br/><br/>However, it might be interesting to make one of the other pieces about how and why people commit atrocities. The last piece is supposed to be about how easy it is to turn a blind eye, to not intervene - however, I might change that.<br/><br/>My belief here is that most people can easily do evil things. It just takes the right situation. However, showing that in a role-playing piece can be difficult. Participants can easily resist factors that real people can't ignore. Peer pressure, hunger, economic hardship, propaganda, cultural heritage... And it's almost impossible to mimic the effects of <i>constant, daily influences</i>; reading daily about how a specific group are a lower form of being, for example, <i>will</i> have an effect on real people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97879/#Comment_97879" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T12:06:45+00:00" title="September 20, 2007 12:06PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2007 12:10PM by PaulB.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well...a war novel written without solid research would be torn to shreds by enthusiasts/armchair experts about that war. History geeks are almost more vicious than RPG geeks. The editing process would, presumably, catch the most grievous factual errors. A good editor would also spot biases that were either historically inaccurate or politically incorrect. Then it'd be up to the free market to elevate the work or to sink it. <br/><br/>I think the issue of trust and responsibility is heightened when there's a teaching or awareness agenda involved. <i>Schindler's List </i>was a terrifically entertaining movie, but Spielberg also had an agenda beyond entertainment. Much has been made about his work with the Shoah Foundation (IIRC, might have that wrong) and the research involved. I'm sure folks still had issues with it despite the work, but at least there was a strong public perception that he'd done his homework, and that the novelist of <i>Schindler's Ark</i> had done his homework. He earned the trust of his audience. He'd also had the benefit of a body of respected work (<i>Empire of the Sun</i>, etc.). Interestingly, the Wikipedia entry about Schindler's List also discusses Spielberg's uncertainty about his own maturity in dealing with the project.<br/><br/>Is trust a valid concern? I think it is. This isn't about you, personally. But yeah, being clear about your sources and your process would IMO put people at ease about voluntarily delving into difficult material. Personally, I wouldn't want to get involved in emotionally difficult stuff only to find out I'd had my strings pulled by a doofus who didn't know what he was talking about.<br/><br/>"The Nazi mindset" -- sorry! Should have been clear that I was talking about the Nazi characters in your scripts, not the Nazi Party or whatever. I do think it'd be very interesting to explore just how slippery a slope atrocities can be. Also totally agree that that's very hard to simulate. It's very easy for us to judge bad behavior when we're well fed and protected.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97893/#Comment_97893" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-20T12:53:03+00:00" title="September 20, 2007 12:53PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>My belief here is that most people can easily do evil things.
