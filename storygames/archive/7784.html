I've never met them before in my life. Let's say I'm GMing them at a con. I've got four hours to give them an unforgettable gaming experience. Maybe they're new to gaming, maybe they're new to story games. They're not familiar with theory and such stuff, and not used to communicating their preferences. Let's say we're playing a game that can do many different things, like PTA or maybe IaWA.<br/><br/>What do I do? What info about these people do I need to know to give them something they'll enjoy? And how do I get that info in the first half hour of play? I'm looking not so much for general advice (though if you have some, shoot), but more for specific things I can throw at them. "Do X. Does anyone of them react by doing Y? In that case, that player is into Z, and you should make sure to do, uh, Q, during the session."<br/><br/>Of course, it'll be generalizations, but there's got to be some good play advice to squeeze out of this subject.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172596/#Comment_172596" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T08:52:47+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  8:52AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Best way to get to know them fast is to tell them a bit about yourself first.

Give them an open-ended problem right at the top and watch what their knee-jerk reactions are. But don't you run the risk of finding out what they're USED TO rather than what they're INTO, at least if they're trad gamers who have never tried story games and don't know what you can do with them?<br/><br/>Jason M: Learn what? What should I look for when shaking hands with them and going through the rituals of civility, and how should I use it to provide a better game for them?<br/><br/>JDC: Good point. It's usually easier to identify what you hate than what you like, probably because it's a much stronger emotional response.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

It seems like a simple thing, but I think it sets an important socializing tone for the next few hours of play.  And it's amazing to me how many people show up at a convention table and simple start with character sheets.  Hello!  We're going to be interacting with each other for hours!  Even the guy who tests you at the DMV introduces himself!<br/><br/>Second, I use games where what the player is interested in will end up on the character sheet.  <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, <i>HeroQuest</i>, <i>Pendragon</i>, <i>Sorcerer</i> or <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i>...  I do character creation at the table for this very reason (no pre-gens), walking the Players through the opportunity to create character with issues or abilities or traits or Kickers that interest <i>them</i>.  When you write, "....and not used to communicating their preferences" all I can think is, "Who cares about that?  Let them just write it down!"<br/><br/>Now, sometimes people spit out cliches or whatnot... and I'll call them on it.  I'll say out loud, "No.  What interests <i>you</i>?"  I pay attention to when people are really getting engaged.  It's not that hard to tell when someone is thinking through ideas that engage them.  They tend to perk up!<br/><br/>Listen.  You're not going to get to know <i>anybody</i> quickly.  You can't.  But you can -- depending what game you're using -- get data on what they'd like to spend the next few hours focusing on as everyone creates a tale.  And then, when they write those things down, use them!<br/><br/>You won't hit every cylinder of the person's Fun Engine. But got knows you'll be hitting a few.  It's a convention game.  You'll be doing better than average on delivering the person fun.<br/><br/>Don't worry about tossing out pop quizzes is my view.  <i>Just let them tell you</i> want they want to focus on for a few hours.  And then do it.<br/><br/><br/>Also, this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon_Pettersson</cite>I've got four hours to give them an unforgettable gaming experience.</blockquote>\nYou might want to take some of the pressure off yourself.
