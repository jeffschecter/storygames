<p>A recent game of Dogs in the Vineyard brought to mind the idea of Giving Up as a mechanic and how it usually plays out.</p>
<p>Obviously I'm thinking of Dogs, but also the Vampire: Mind's Eye Theatre rules.  Both systems work better (to varying degrees) if players relent before they're exhausted, but the tempation I've always seen is to hang on to the bitter end.</p>
<p>I can see a few reasons for this behavior.  One is psychological: people (self included) don't like to give up.  It's like, until you give up, you still have a chance at winning, but when you give up, you lose.</p>
<p>Another relates directly to the fact that we're resolving something.  If I give up, I'm giving up something that I care about.  Especially in conflict resolution, and even moreso in games with stakes and couterstakes: if I give up, I really am yielding what I wanted, and accepting what I didn't want.</p>
<p>As an aside, one of the hidden brilliances of The Shadow of Yesterday is that the setting of stakes becomes part of the strategy of a conflict: if you want to get your stakes, make them palatable to your opponent, you're you'll have to fight it out to the bitter end.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I do like mechanics where one contestant yeilds, (and I love bidding games, partly for this reason), but they rely a lot on being played "right."  And correct play (meaning, relenting before being forced to) can be really difficult for some people to get - and my experience is that they wind up not liking the game as a result.</p>
<p>Is there any way to make early bow outs more agreeable?  That's my question.</p>

                            Games like For Sale are good at this; if you get something Win or Lose, but you have to pay something to win... you'll tend to balance the two-- winning when it's useful, but saving your currency when it's not important.  [For Sale works particularly well in multi-sided conflicts.  Basically, each person bids X to stay in, or passes and gets the worst reward.  Everyone but the player who wins the bid gets half their bid back, but the winner of the bid has to pay it all.  So there's a strong desire to be #2-- getting not quite everything, but not spending as much as the winner either.]                        </div>

                            There is also another issue in that a lot of us are trained by previous RPG experience. <br/><br/>In many RPGs, especially illusionist or gm-whammy style games, there is always a way for the players to succede at something if they really, really want to or the GM wants them to. Its just a matter of fighting hard enough, long enough, and finding the magic dingus that will make all your dreams of victory come true. <br/><br/>If you want into the room, you just have to roll your lockpicking enough times. Or you just have to do the insane jig the GM wants you to. Or you just have to go back to the village and talk to the little old lady that you didn't talk to the first time despite the fact that the GM was clearly saying she was cool and you should talk to her, so that you can get the key and get into the room. Or whatever. <br/><br/>Things you can't do, you usually pretty clearly just cannot do. If you want to go over the bridge into town, the bridge falls down there is a storm and a dragon eats all the boats on the river and then God comes and tells you to go into the wilderness. <br/><br/>You get a lot of this even in a certain style of gamist games, where the question is always: how do we overcome this challange and never should we even bother, or is there a way around? You know you have to kill the dragon to save the princess, and as that is the point of the game, you're going to kill the dragon. Its just a matter of finding the right strategy to kill the dragon, which obviously must be possible or else the GM is cheating. <br/><br/>So when we get to games like Dogs where you really have to question if you can win this fight -- at all, ever -- or if you even should be having this fight, we often come up short. Part of our brain is thinking about how to find the magic key to victory, about the right strategy to kill the dragon, when by the logic of the system we need to be thinking things like "is this worth dying for" or "what does it say if I quit now" or even "um, why the hell did I pick this fight again?" <br/><br/>The only way I've found past that particular block is to stick to the guns as a GM and talk to the players OOCly. Show them, over and over and over again that they can give and that they can't win every conflict and shouldn't expect to win every conflict. Show them that their choices actually do matter. <br/><br/>In addition to that, getting good at making small, givable stakes is pretty key. This can be in the Dogs sense or the "win or lose either way makes for fun play" sense. If someone's first exposure to giving is on a conflict that will kill their character, you gotta know that they're going to go tooth and claw. If, otoh, the first time they come up against the out-gunned wall is when the stakes are something along the lines of "make Sister Prudence think I have kind eyes" or "if I win I marry the princess, if I lose I have a hot affair with her sister in her bed" then giving might be more tempting.                        </div>

                            Obviously, Dogs has the Cut Your Losses mechanic to soften the blow of giving.  Unfortunately one die doesn't count for much in a followup where you can bring in six or eight traits on your sheet.                        </div>

                            Unless you have a 7 or higher sitting there in conflicts made up mostly of d6s. <br/><br/>The reason that Joseph beat your ass in the one conflict was because he went into it with a 10 from his previous give.

<p>Sydney calls it "Name that Tune."  The moment when you take stock, realize that you <em>could</em> keep fighting, but that the extra resources you'll spend are no longer worth the chance of victory.</p>
<p>We'll be going along, fighting back and forth, and he'll take a long look at where things stand, and say "Right.  Name that tune."  And then we'll tell him how he suffers.</p>

<em>All you have to do is be willing to lose the first conflict.</em><br/><br/>Yeah, but is that really a conflict?  My take is no, not really.  It's sort of the player-side "Say Yes or Roll Dice" -- if you don't care about it, don't call for conflict. =P                        </div>

                            It depends on the stakes though, doesn't it. <br/><br/>If the stakes are "You fall in love with Joseph because he's so hot" how fast are you giving? <br/><br/>As with all things, the utility of the solution depends on the preasure of the situation. <br/><br/>And yea, if you don't care for it don't call for it. So in order to get those 10s you do have to be giving something you cared about in the first place. <br/><br/>Which is exactly why I don't have a problem with it.                        </div>

                            Ah, see, you're talking about stakes coming from the NPCs.  If I'm starting conflicts and setting my stakes with no counterstakes, maybe with a little negotiation in there, ain't no situation I can't set stakes I don't care about giving on.<br/>

                            Sure, but if you do that Josh I just say "yes." <br/><br/>So you say "I start a conflict to see if she gives me lemonade" I just say, "No conflict, she gives it to you." <br/><br/>I'm a bitch like that.<br/><br/>Hell, at that point the whole thing can be a good way to keep the GM from obfuscating and pulling crap on you. If you are able to take advantage of conflicts that don't matter, then the GM has more reason to make sure to be saying yes and only rolling dice when it really counts.                        </div>

                            I wonder how much a slight gambling application might play into this with players who see the "winning" portion of continuing to roll against something.  ("But I KNOW I can get that perfect 17!")  [snort]  <br/><br/>(In discussion with my husband on this, he says there's probably a similar adrenaline rush with the goal of accomplishing task/whatnot.   On the other hand, I seem to roll dice just to see how unlucky I end up being...)                        </div>

                            On reflection (and re-reading) I remember that a really excellent example of this appears in _The Shadow of Yesterday,_ in Bringing Down the Pain.<br/>
<br/>
If, when I Bring Pain, I set stakes that are utterly unacceptable, my opponent is unlikely to yield.  "If I win, you die."  Since there's no real difference in those cases between yielding and losing, you fight it out to the end.<br/>
<br/>
What I'm looking at is the crucial understanding that sees that, on the one hand, if I set my stakes so that they're not as bad as fighting on, I just get them, and on the other hand, sometimes bad stakes are not as bad as fighting on.  And I've experienced the epiphany of getting that, and I've watch people *not* get it.  <br/>
<br/>
Given how satisfying it is to play games where stakes are set, and someone gives into bag stakes, I'd like to make that more accessible.  Is there a way to file down that hump of understanding, so that anyone can get it?  For instance, _Shadow_ puts the whole bag on the table with the players all at once, and _Dogs_ kind of tucks it away in the system - there's enough going on that the Fight On impulse is stoked pretty well. <br/>
<br/>
It might be that there isn't a way to make this easier to learn.  After all, I think this is also one of the big hurdles for Americans in learning Go.<br/>
<br/>
(But maybe there's the hint: what if by Yielding you get a free turn somewhere else...hrm)                        </div>
