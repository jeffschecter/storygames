Two men enter, one man leaves... such is the law of Thunderdome.<br/><br/>So, in certain <i>other</i> threads you have heard scandolous rumours, outright lies, and misinformation posted by a certain Justin Jacobson. He <i>claims</i> to have incriminating photos of me with the ambassador, but I say that I have never been near Sweeden and besides which I am allergic to peanut butter...<br/><br/>What?<br/><br/>Oh. *clears throat* Heh. Wrong insinusations. Wow. That could have been embarrasing.<br/><br/>So, uhmm... maybe less grandstanding. Here's the deal. In the game designer challenge thread, Justin Jacobson/ i.e./aka/ Justin D. Jacobson requested a challenge. Taking time out of my busy schedule I crafted a challenge for him. This challenge was no ordinary piece of writing... it was a work of such eloquence and beauty that even the most untalented RPG designer would have been inspired and enabled to write the greatest game ever written.<br/><br/>Despite this, he refused the challenge and insulted my honor.<br/><br/>Now the next part is a little fuzzy... because I am pretty sure that I challenged HIM to a game-design duel, but he is claiming otherwise. Treacherous dog that he is. Hmmm...yes... anyway.<br/><br/>We hammered out the particulars; Moderator Graham solicited and decided on the particulars and announced them in this <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2900&amp;page=1#Item_5" rel="nofollow">thread</a>.<br/><br/>Like my oponent, I will be using this thread to post ideas, solicit feedback, and generally question the legitimacy of his parentage and his utter lack of manliness. Because I am a sporting sort, I let him post the first salvo... take the first shot, if you will. But now that the battle has begun in earnest, I will hold nothing back!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66319/#Comment_66319" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-01T09:27:02+00:00" title="May  1, 2007  9:27AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, for those keeping score, the terms of the duel were set to be -\n<ul>\n<li>Genre: Film Noir [excellent, I LOVE film Noir]</li>\n<li>Theme: Travel [easy to fit in... doesn't require too much extra work]</li>\n<li>Mechanics: Musical Scale [easy as...uhh.... oh crap, I don't know anything about music</li>\n</ul>\nSo, I have been doing a lot of thought on that issue. Like my opponent I too have done a large bit of preliminary research... mostly starting with Wikipedia. First I reviewed a lot of classic Noir films and read some critical essays on the essential elements of Noir. Following that I began to learn about musical scales. And I just have to say...<br/><br/>Holy crap, music is complicated! I had no idea.<br/><br/>After extensive research though (unlike my oponent who appears to have decided that musical theory was beyond his feeble understanding) I think that I finally have enough down to cobble together something of a system. And that will be the cornerstone of a RPG that I have named "Sweet, Sad, Song".<br/><br/>Which, incidentally is a far more Noir appropriate name than "MacGuffin"... which frankly makes me think more about Mel Gibson mooning people and shouting 'Freedom' that it does about the black secrets and dirty lies of the urban jungle. <br/><br/>Once I knew that music was going to be the cornerstone (rather than something shoehorned in, like some people seem to be doing) I decided to base it on a particularl style of music. So, the core of the game is going to come from my (sadly) small knowledge of bebop, a form of jazz which plays as the background to many Noir movies. But why bebop?<br/><br/>Simple, 'improvisation'.  Jazz is, at its heart, about the collaborative muscial 'storytelling' of a group of musicians without playing off of a set script. If this isn't roleplaying then I don't know what is. At the same time, even though it is freewheeling, as music it is also constrained by a set of pretty strong rules... which led me to my next design 'thought'... the importance of harmony and discord. Let me explain:<br/><br/>So we have a musical scale that can hold any one of 8 notes. What if each of those 8 positions had a special type of storytelling significance, in line with our noir sensibilities say...\n<ul>\n<li>Position 1: Crime/Money (and its inverse 'Law')</li>\n<li>Position 2: Sex (and its inverse 'Loyalty'.... I realize that this is weak <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/> )</li>\n<li>Position 3: Violence (and its inverse 'Honor'???)</li>\n<li>Position 4: Power (and its inverse 'Alienation')</li>\n<li>Position 5: Secrets (and its inverse 'Exposure'?)</li>\n<li>Position 6: Enclosure (and its inverse 'Freedom')</li>\n<li>Position 7: Insanity/Addiction (and its inverse 'Apathy')</li>\n<li>Position 8: Cruel Fate (and its inverse 'Random Chance')</li>\n</ul>\nNow these aren't quite "there" yet, but hopefully you can see where I am going with each category and how they relate to the whole Film-Noir 'mythos'. I am thinking of jettisoning the whole list and just plugging in the seven deadly sins (modified a bit, of course). But what do those positions have to do with anything?<br/><br/>So, lets say that the title Noir detective is currently interviewing a leggy blond. As the 'leader', I decide that I want to have a ganster crash in through the front door (introducing some elements of violence). In order to do this I would need to roll some dice to place a note in Position 3 (currently an E note) [the mechanics for being allowed to do this are not currently in place].<br/><br/> Simple enough, right? Well, here is where it gets weird: the other players have the opportunity to produce a 'chord' and contribute to the information that I have already established. They can either play in 'Harmony' (elaborating on my idea) or in 'Discord' (by establishing an element that complicates the original intent).<br/><br/>Now to make things more complicated (to match music theory), there are only certain positions that produce harmony They can either place a note in a 'harmonic' position (either 3 [Enclosure, here]above the note or 5 [Cruel Fate] above the note played). Harmony is 'mechanically' easier to perform... but an entirely harmonious song is rather boring.<br/><br/>Discord notes, on the other hand are the way to introduce conflict into the equation.  The 'discord' note can be any other note, although there is a reward for playing the 7th postion (because of the 'Blues Note'). Here is the thing though... once discord/conflict has been introduced, you have to quickly resolve it (through a harmonious cord).<br/><br/>Mechanically speaking, discord is the way that one player tries to rest narrative control from another.<br/><br/>So there is a whole lot more involved in this system that I am looking at (including shifting keys, and chord progression - which means that for a series of notes you must include at least one note from the previous cord or break the note sequence, creating a new scene).<br/><br/>My big worry right now is that it may prove to be too complicated and so I am looking to pare some things down without losing some of the actual musicality of it all.<br/><br/>Thoughts are always appreciated <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66323/#Comment_66323" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-01T09:36:55+00:00" title="May  1, 2007  9:36AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not to be outdone by the foolish scribblings of my laughable opponent, I too have a 'cover image' to guide my development (note how much more detailed and genre appropriate mine is):<br/><br/><img alt="Image Hosted by ImageShack.us" src="http://img186.imageshack.us/img186/7986/detective3553gv9.jpg"/><br/><br/>So, if you slogged through the last (lamentably long) post... you might be curious about the 'travel' element since I didn't really talk about it.<br/><br/>Well, I actually have four takes on where to go with that... and I am trying to hash it all out before I actually sit down and begin writing.\n<ul>\n<li>Either I go with a more traditional Noir mythos, with the proviso that all of the characters are 'about to leave' (because of whatever demons pursue them)... and have all stories take place on the cusp of that moment of travel</li>\n<li>Or, I could narrow the focus and force all characters to be in an enclosed setting that is literally traveling (a number of good noir movies take place on a train although a ship would also be appropriate)</li>\n<li>Or, going a more traditional 'party of players' route, I could go Steam-Punk with it and have the players acting as sort of traveling 'troubleshooters'... who are in and of themselves all haunted and hunted people.

I would really like to honor that spirit by having the mechanics reflect those sensibilities in a way that is distinctly RPG.<br/><br/><b>German Expressionism </b>- If you have read the Wikipedia article on Noir (and haven't we all?) you know that the sort of twisted representational world of the 20's German films is strongly reflected in the Noir visual aesthetic. More important though, for my purposes, is the conceit that the environment should be reflective of the inner conflicts of the character. If his life is a mess, his environment should be messy. If he is violent, everything is coated in red with sharp, hard, angles (etc.). <br/><br/>I would like to reward that by providing in-game incentive for people to make suggestions on how scenery elements and events can reflect the inner personality (most likely as part of the harmony system discussed above)<br/><br/><b>Visual Obscuring</b> To reflect the hidden nature of a characters personality or the twisted demons running through their psyche, Noir uses a lot of methods of visually obscuring a character (shadows mostly, but also shots through mirrors, projections onto characters, shots through glass, etc).<br/><br/>I want to reflect this by visually obscuring parts of the character sheet. I also think that when players propose certain elements to be added to the story, they will propose only the initial 'visual' element (probably by writing it on an index card) but an additional 'internal' element will be suggested at the same time as well but initially kept hidden (on the back of the card).<br/><br/><b>Camera Tricks</b> Noir uses a lot of bizzare angles, mostly to represent the power of one character over another or a character's domination of the scene. In addition they have some specific lenses designed to emphasize the mental turmoil or insanity of a character (wide angled fish lenses and tilted angles).<br/><br/>I am leaning to representing these with dice... so that when a character is dominating another character he literally uses bigger dice (hopefully done in a way that avoids a death spiral for the dominated character). For the insanity angle, I am ensivisioning some way of switching what values of the dice matter (for instance, if high numbers are normally important, then when under the influence of a 'bender' you might be looking for low numbers).<br/><br/>Just thoughts though... we'll see how it all works in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_66341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

It is not really important for the player to know (although I hope they will) that they are placing an 'E Flat' note, so much as it is that 'Violence' game elements go on slot three of the musical scale chart (which I am thinking will be in the center of the gaming group).<br/><br/>Here are the other rules that I banged together (elaborated a bit from what is above). Let me know if they sound too complicated.<br/><br/>So a player puts down a Base note wherever he wants...<br/><br/>Other players can put notes in the same vertical line as him with the following results - <br/><br/>Harmony (the following positions bring harmony):<br/>Base Note +3, Base Note +5, Base Note +9<br/><br/>Dissonance (the following positions are dissonant):<br/>Any non-harmonious notes are dissonant, Bonus for using Base Note +7<br/><br/>[If a number goes off the scale it cycles down to the bottom]<br/><br/>Once the chord has been placed (a cord can have up to five vertical elements), there needs to be some cord progression. The next 'cords' base Note has to be one of the elements from the previous cord.<br/><br/>I am thinking about specifying some traditional 'basic' cord progressions to represent certain types of stories.<br/><br/>Now, I was going to do a whole thing about keys and rearranging of notes, but I think I may nix my more complicated idea and sort of constrain it to 'major' and 'minor' keys (one being more 'happy' scenes and the second being 'sad' scenes). I also had a wierd idea about using the key progression to indicate the length of the story... but I am not 100% on that yet.<br/><br/>On a side note, reading this again it sounds bloody complicated, here is hoping that you have developed something cleaner <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66359/#Comment_66359" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-01T11:15:50+00:00" title="May  1, 2007 11:15AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I think Adam is on<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the</span>a right track with his thinking around harmonic and disharmonic notes.

Rarely have the words poured forth from my brain with such intensity and such drive. I look in the direction of my opponent and laugh... LAUGH, I say... for he has no idea of the level of awesomeness that I am capable of bringing to the table! <br/><br/>Unless he is reading these design posts... in which case he probably has a pretty good idea.<br/><br/>So, I think that I have a pretty firm version of the 7 intervals/notes (based, as you will note, on the seven deadly sins). The positive versions are much rougher but they are starting to come in as well:\n<ul>\n<li>Line 1: Money (greed) / Soft Spot</li>\n<li>Line 2: Sex (lust) / Love</li>\n<li>Line 3: Violence (wrath) / Cool</li>\n<li>Line 4: Secrets (envy) / Innocence</li>\n<li>Line 5: Corruption (sloth) / Loyalty</li>\n<li>Line 6 Power (pride) / Law</li>\n<li>Line 7: Addiction (gluttony) / Hope</li>\n</ul>\nYou\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll note that they are pretty much the same as the last version (dropping one and with some tweaks here are there) but I am much happier with it. Of course, apart from their narrative use, I am note sure exactly what purpose these things serve on the character sheet\xe2\u20ac\xa6 yet. <br/><br/>I am kind of looking at a token system where depending on your raiting in each note, you recieve a number of tokens to perform somthing that bends the rules (more on this later). I like this angle because I can allow attacks or temptations to result in an exchange of tokens (which brings in some negotiation to the game) and allows a character to become much better at one thing at the expense of all his other skills.<br/><br/> Other than that, I could do a whole note/half note/ fourth note/ sixteenth note system to indicate the character\xe2\u20ac\u2122s proficiency in that general area. Specifically if we are rolling with some sort of dice pool system, that very nicely seques into how many dice a character might get to roll (4/3/2/1.)<br/><br/>Now to start thinking about improving those virtues\xe2\u20ac\xa6<br/><br/>Part of the problem, of course, is that the dark and bitter world of Noir provides so few positive virtues (especially in the male characters); so, things like \xe2\u20ac\u0153not being a criminal\xe2\u20ac\x9d end up practically making people into saints *shrug*<br/><br/> So, everything in this world (locations, characters, actions, the plot, everything) is going to be made up of a series of \xe2\u20ac\u02dcpositions/notes\xe2\u20ac\u2122 from those categories above. To broaden things a bit, each \xe2\u20ac\u02dcnote\xe2\u20ac\u2122 has a positive and a negative side (sharps and flats, respectively). Although I want to constrain the use of sharps\xe2\u20ac\xa6 otherwise that should nicely constrain things within a Noir frame of mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

You are correct that noir film characters aren't exactly known for their virtues.

This is good news because my opponent still seems to be operating in a land of dreams and fairies where everything will mystically take shape at the last second! Your long "thinking" walks will not save you Justin D. Jacobson!<br/><br/>Anyway, for those keeping score, here is the outline of the music system\xe2\u20ac\xa6 it is pretty wordy (what? me? Never!), so my sincere apologies. <br/><br/>So, the basic sheet/scale has seven lines (we are counting the black lines as seperate white spaces) and they are labeled from A to G. On the left side is a column where a counter can be placed indicated which note is the \xe2\u20ac\u02dckey\xe2\u20ac\u2122 note.<br/><br/>When framing an initial scene, the bass player (who functions sort of like the producer in PTA) sets the 'key' note as an indication of what the scene is going to be about. For instance, the players might request a confrontation between the harried hitman and the corrupt policeman... at which point the bassist could call for something like a scene in the Key of C (Violence) indicating that this is going to be a bloody conflict, or he could call for a scene in the key of D (Secrets) indicating that perhaps everything was not as clear cut as it seemed...<br/><br/>Basically, when introducing a story element or performing an action, the closer you are to the key note the easier it is to play (lower difficulty). <br/><br/>However, part of the conflict (seperate from harmony and discord) will be the ability to change the key note\xe2\u20ac\xa6 which in practice will change the availability and ease of certain options. When changing the key, you will also have the ability to introduce sharps and flats by going into a \xe2\u20ac\u02dcmajor\xe2\u20ac\u2122 or \xe2\u20ac\u02dcminor\xe2\u20ac\u2122 version of the key (you can play those notes at any time, anyway\xe2\u20ac\xa6 it is just easier to do so if they are placed on the scale).<br/><br/>Originally I was going to maintain the actual scales and their placement of flats and sharps but I think that I may just abstract the whole thing and say that playing a major or minor scale puts a sharp or flat (respectively) on the key note and the notes that are +/- 3 away. It is less correct but it is easier to remember.<br/><br/>I am pretty sure that eliminating the importance of relative positions on harmony and discord is a good idea (suggested up thread) and so I think that the person who is playing the base note of the cord will determine whether an element is contributive or destructive (and base the conflict on that). <br/><br/>Other than that, the rules concerning harmonious cords remains\xe2\u20ac\xa6 ie. you are required to contain at least one note from the previous cord in the next one to remain harmonious. Otherwise you introduce discord (exactly as if you had played a discordant note in your original chord). Discord must always resolve into a harmonious cord.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_66902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/66902/#Comment_66902" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-04T10:10:16+00:00" title="May  4, 2007 10:10AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Justin D.

There was a very cool article linked off of Wikipeida that talks about how Noir characters fiercely cling to their one bit of virtue... especially since it is the only shred of decency they have left.<br/><br/>I really like the idea about using virtue to counter a use of vice, although if that is how they are resolved mechanically I would need to change the names to make them more directly opposite.

Hillariously enough, this line of thinking actually came about through the original challenge that I issued\xe2\u20ac\xa6 which caused this duel (namely, creation of mystery plots with an ACTUAL answer that could be investigated without resorting to a centralized GM type figure). <br/><br/>Of course, incorporating this into my game will not only prove the brilliance of the original idea (so rudely snubbed), but will also make my inevtiable victory oh so much sweeter. I can taste it now... it tastes like... utter anhiliation.<br/><br/>*cough* Anyway, as I see it, most Noir plots have so many twists and turns that it is almost silly to expect a single person to come up with them. Famously in \xe2\u20ac\u02dcThe Big Heat\xe2\u20ac\u2122, shooting ground to a halt because no one (Raymond Chandler included) could figure out who had killed a particular character. So I thought to myself\xe2\u20ac\xa6 "self, you should let EVERYONE come up with plots (this is for detective noir specifically, for dramatic noir things are a little different)".<br/><br/>So, I have this vision of people each creating one of a series of notecards at the beginning of the game\xe2\u20ac\xa6 each divided into a specific set of categories, say:\n<ul>\n<li>Suspects </li>\n<li>Motivations </li>\n<li>Places </li>\n<li>Crimes </li>\n<li>Clues</li>\n</ul>\nFor each card the player should give it a name and assign it one to three notes (along with the standard Note Aspects\xe2\u20ac\xa6 which I probably haven\xe2\u20ac\u2122t talked about yet) <br/><br/>For instance, if I was writing a \xe2\u20ac\u0153Clue\xe2\u20ac\x9d, I might put on my index card:<br/><br/>\xe2\u20ac\u0153The Scent of Perfume\xe2\u20ac\x9d - Key Note: Sex (B) "Expensive and yet trashy"; Chord Notes: Corruption (E) "A faint smell of sweat and desperation"<br/><br/>When writing suspects down, characters CAN be suspects (there needs to be some benifit to entering into the whole shebang) and in a one-shot or traditional Noir story they will be. Although, in a long running game, they did not necessarily do it\xe2\u20ac\xa6 in which case they should be entered as Red Herrings(see below).<br/><br/>Once all the cards have been written, the players put them down in a series of seperate piles. Then they draw a card (preferably one that they didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t write, but if they get shuffled up then that is okay) from each stack. Then they put their initials on the back of each of those cards. This represents a single line of \xe2\u20ac\u2122cause\xe2\u20ac\u2122 and effect.<br/><br/>In \xe2\u20ac\u02dcClue\xe2\u20ac\u2122 terms - Through the Clues, we learned that Suspect did the Crime in the Location because of Motivation.<br/><br/>What about connecting it all together? Well, I am imagining that once that is done, everyone will mix the cards up again and draw a whole new set. On the front of that card they will either write their initials or the initials of the person listed on the back of the card.<br/><br/>They will probably also create two new cards with JUST their initials on the front (or the initials of one of the other cards they have). These are red herrings and not connected to any of the real crimes.<br/><br/>Everything is placed back into their seperate piles.<br/><br/>The person who is playing bass (superficially he is sort-of the GM, but his main job is to force conflict, settle disputes, and keep things rolling rather than express creative control) then gives a general structure to the whole shebang by organizing how they are revealed and helping close up faulty interpretations.<br/><br/>Basically speaking, until you have \xe2\u20ac\u2122solved the card\xe2\u20ac\u2122 (and flipped it over) investigative questions will be resolved by the person with initials on the front of the card. He can give you the truth or lead you to other cards.<br/><br/>Sounds confusing right? Well that is Noir for you.<br/><br/>I am thinking of allow characters with a high \xe2\u20ac\u02dcSecrets\xe2\u20ac\u2122 score to be able to unravel some of this mess (by flipping cards and revealing the underlying murder that they are connected to). I am also thinking that knowing who 'did' a particular crime will give you 'Power' over them and help you twist them into doing some horrible other task for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70075/#Comment_70075" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T14:15:16+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  2:15PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So alright... I have been biding my time, refining my design, getting closer to a final draft, waiting for the next big hit from Justin... but nothing has come, so I thought to myself that it is time to ramp up the intensity a little bit as we ride ever closer to that 29th deadline. After all, if he resigns from the competition because he can't pull things together... well... I just can't stand to see a guy that embarrassed. So consider this some pity-related pep.<br/><br/>How do you ramp up intensity? Trash talk, of course.<br/><br/>So, here are a series of completely false allegations concerning Justin D. Jacobson... in the spirit of fairness, I invite open discussion of these allegations so long as there is no disagreement.<br/><br/>1. Justin's game 'MacGuffin' is currently 21 words long. It reads: "Everyone makes a character in the style of Noir. Everyone uses the rules to play an awesome game." What are the referenced 'Rules' he is referring to? They read thusly... "Rules: Magic Happens".<br/><br/>2. Justin is widely suspected of being the second gunman on the grassy knoll. And not the kind of gnoll that might give you some worthwhile XP... the bad kind of knoll. The kind that has ties to Majectic-12 and the CIA/KGB.<br/><br/>3. In a recent press interview, conducted by Ryan "Master Plan" Macklin... Justin chose not to be interviewed at the same time as me citing his reasons as "overwhelming fear of my opponenent and his mastery of game design".<br/><br/>4. Justin D Jacobson dislikes cute kitties. Also, puppies. I mean, what kind of monster dislikes fuzzy animals?<br/><br/>So, if you were a betting person... the Vegas odds are pretty heavily in my favor. I am young, hungry, and willing to hit below the belt to win this thing! <br/><br/>With that being said, I wouldn't dream of posting more rules stuff until Justin catches his breath <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
