Lots of fun for gamer and non-gamer alike. It's local so I don't know if it will be showing in your area or not but if you get the chance it's worth having a look. If not, the film-maker was saying that they will be on NetFlix and some other VOD places later this year.  <br/><br/>Trailer &amp; more info here: <a href="http://www.unicorncity.com/" rel="nofollow">Unicorn City</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
