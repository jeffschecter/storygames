Please EMAIL me (click on my name for my profile page which lists my email) to let me know if you're interested in playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nDetails: TONIGHT (Saturday night US/Sun AM Japan), 9PM EST/6PM PST. Will last approx 4 hours. Characters are pre-generated, complete with a little story infusion in the form of a "secret".<br/>\n<br/>\nIt will be over SKYPE, so before you say yes please go ahead and test out your mic/headphones/skype to make sure you can commit (would hate to have tech problems at the last minute).<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease email me rather than whisper here, because I'll be spotty checking SG today, but will have access to email. Also, might take me up to 2 hours to reply to email.<br/>\n<br/>\n===============<br/>\n<br/>\nShinobigami (God of the Shinobi) is a contemporary-set story game of warring ninja clans in modern day Tokyo (think World of Darkness, but with ninjas instead of vampires). There are six clans, each with their own goals. Four ninja must work together to overcome a dark challenge, and yet their goals will be at odds with each other. There will be dramatic tension and even conflict/combat, but not "Muy Macho I stab you in the face and burn you to death!" style hardcore PVP. It's a Japanese RPG currently being translated for publication within the next year. The feel is anime-ish, but semi-serious as well. Not no-joking GrimDark hardcore world of darkness, and yet not silly Maid or slapstick-like play either.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rules will be explained as we play. It's a simple 2d6 skill system, but there's a lot going on with character secrets and the rules for relationships and how those secrets get revealed. The focus is on narrative story, but there are some cool light combat moments and the like as well. I've wanted to play it for evars. Matt's run it several times, the rest of us have never played it. Plus, while I know Matt and Alex, no one else has really met anyone else here, so you're not walking into Old Friends' Land or anything like that, new folks are totally 100% welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nTonight's roster is:<br/>\nMatt Sanchez (the translator, will be GMing from Japan!)<br/>\nMe<br/>\nAlex from Yellow-Menace.com<br/>\nEd from Yellow-Menace.com<br/>\nGrant from MiniENT had to back out due to illness<br/>\n(insert one more here)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's some links to Shinobigami:<br/>\n<br/>\nMatth talks Shinobigami on J-RPG: http://j-rpg.com/talk/discussion/48/shinobigami/p1<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter Sheet: http://d66roc.wordpress.com/2010/11/11/shinobigami-character-sheet/<br/>\n<br/>\nRules Translation Preview: http://d66roc.wordpress.com/2010/11/09/shinobigami-final-translation-preview/<br/>\n<br/>\nA blog post about how drama scenes work: http://d66roc.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/shinobigami-drama-scene-emotional-bonds/<br/>\n<br/>\nThe original Japanese page: http://www.bouken.jp/pd/sg/index.html<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_335830">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/335830/#Comment_335830" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-23T22:33:37+00:00" title="July 23, 2011 10:33PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet!
