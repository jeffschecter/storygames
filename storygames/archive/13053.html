I lost a bit of time with my formatting because i didn't set tabs but GD also killed any *bold* text.  There's likely a right way to export for Google preferences but i hadn't had to do it before and was a bit crazed because of the deadline.<br/><br/>So, some time blows by in editing that.  Fine.  And then i need to export that document, now edited, back into my system as an InDesign document.  The new formatting is wiped out.  And since I'd like to use a few different typefaces, and in some instances Smallcaps, then i'm taking it in the head on formatting again anew.  This time as i'm setting stuff up on the final Sunday.  <br/><br/>With graphics programs, i hold on to the original doc and just export to different formats.  With game text i'm not sure what constitutes an original and how best to preserve the work flow.  I mean, right now... the pdf is the best edited version which means i need to get that bad boy out of InDesign and back into some sort of regular document program.  Right?  Or do i just work in ID?<br/><br/>Anyway, for those of you who have done this before and wrestled the beast and it's many insufferable heads: how do you manage your work flow and property?  I'm seeking to learn from your wisdom.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294225/#Comment_294225" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-21T19:43:29+00:00" title="September 21, 2010  7:43PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once I move to InDesign I usually stay there, even if I moved to early.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294226/#Comment_294226" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-21T20:43:27+00:00" title="September 21, 2010  8:43PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience the best bet is to not do any text styling before your text has been edited and is ready for layout. For this to work your book design and text editing departments have to be fully integrated with the layout department, which works fine for me, being how all of those departments are just myself, and I've never had trouble coordinating with myself.<br/><br/>Write early drafts as simple text files with ASCII or similar simple encoding. Use custom tagging for commenting and notes that are needed later. For example, [I use brackets for meta-commentary that is supposed to be removed later], /slashes/ for emphasis, *asterisks* for bolding and so on, but it's all essentially arbitrary as long as your layout/editing department knows what's going on; this stuff is not primarily intended for machine processing, as it's going to be removed and replaced by proper formatting in the first typographic layout pass. Nothing stops you from writing [sidebar] at the beginning of a paragraph to signify that it's going to be a sidebar, after all.<br/><br/>If the nature of the project requires tidy drafts on paper for external consumption, I generally go immediately into a layout program, distribute pdfs and request edits as pdf comments. External commenters do not need editing access to the text in a normal project, so a pdf suffices; if you need to give somebody editing access, then you either make sure they use the same programs you use or it's no longer the integrated editing/layout workflow I specified up in the first paragraph.<br/><br/>It's notable that my way of working pretty much removes the modern text editor software from the process - Word is too complex for just writing and too simple for doing layout, so there's rarely a reason to risk it. The theoretical role of the program in work flow would be in creating internal office documents that don't need high-grade layout or typography, but this being a one-man office, I only use Word to write up grant applications and such. Another theoretical use is in splitting up editing and layout: you could do the editorial stage of the work in Word, text formatting and all, and then push the result into the layout program. I understand that this even works reliably nowadays in some combinations of hardware, operating system, text editor and layout program. I started doing this stuff early in the decade with QuarkXPress 4, and as importing from text editors was a total crapshoot at the time, I learned early to simply skip the essentially useless step in the workflow; as you're going to have to go through the text with a comb in layout anyway, you might as well do all the styling then.<br/><br/>So the short answer is yes, stay in InDesign once you move there. If you absolutely hate doing text editing in the layout program, have the program export tagged plain text with the program's own tagging system and edit that - at least in Quark that's a reasonably stable way of taking a text out of the layout format and later putting it back in without messing up the styling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294227/#Comment_294227" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-21T21:12:10+00:00" title="September 21, 2010  9:12PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FWIW, I find that when I don't format early, I regret it, at least for body-text. I basically do what Eero said when it comes to side-bars, and just bracket them, or something, to denote that they're different than the main body text. But when I don't use bolding, italics, tabbing, differing fonts, et al. in the original document, I end up spending a MUCH longer time having to fix it up later, because I have to read the entire document line by line to figure out what should be formatted how, which usually ends up with me trying to rewrite lines and phrases, even whole paragraphs, when all I was intending to do was format it consistently with the rest of the document.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do wonder if the problem you had with GD has to do with Pages, though. While GD doesn't recognize my preferred body font, it keeps all formatting inasmuch as it's capable when I copy and paste from Word. Lately, I've just being doing my basic composing in GD though, simply because I'm finding time and inspiration don't always collude when I have access to my home computer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_294243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294243/#Comment_294243" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-22T04:27:17+00:00" title="September 22, 2010  4:27AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do minimal styling for clarity as I work on a draft, then strip it out for the export and redo everything.
