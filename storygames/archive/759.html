I've seen this attitude before, that some premises are better for games, and some are better for books, and you don't find many that are both.<br/>
<br/>
Where did this come from?  It seems rather odd.                </div>

                            I think there are plenty of premises that could make for both good games and good books (or TV shows or movies).  I should have elaborated--I felt that the direction the discussion was taking, where after nine posts and an explosion of background/setting ideas nobody had yet mentioned even a hazy mechanic, sounded more like the development of a plotted story than a set of tools for story creation.  My apologies if I stepped on any toes.                        </div>

                            I think that in general you have to be centered on a team or group, while books can be much more easily focused on a single protagonist.                        </div>

                            I firmly believe that many amateur game designers running homebrew systems and railroading plots wish they were novelists. (I don't know if I belong to this group or not.) Whenever Judson and I discussed this phenomenon, we called it "<b>Game as Fiction</b>." Don't know if I'm reinventing the alternator here or not, but it was a useful shorthand term. Basically, if it looks like fiction, quacks like fiction, and has a saving throw, then it's probably fiction.<br/><br/>What's the difference between a good setting for a game and a good premise for a novel (movie, short story, etc)? I think it has to do with having a big plot and envisioning a definite end point. If there's no room for PCs to get involved and muck things up trying to achieve then objectives, then I don't think there's a <i>game</i>.<br/><br/>I know I'm not the only one who has thought this before.<br/><br/>MDK                        </div>

                            I think that pretty much anything that would make a good novel would make a good rpg, but not everything that would make a good rpg would make a good book. The reason is that character identification can be much stronger in an rpg than a book, so you can overcome otherwise weak setups more easily with an rpg. (For example, I would claw out my own eyes rather than read another generic fantasy novel. However, there's many a D&amp;D game I'd happily join.)                        </div>

                            I agree with Neel, with the caveat that it somewhat depends on (a) what the avenues for player input are in the way you're running the game, and (b) the fictive tastes and preferences of the players.<br/><br/>(a) often comes up in relation to protagonism.  If it's hard for the players to have any effect on the game except through a character, for example, then the RPG version of a novel which isn't character-focussed will likely be unsatisfying. I think that this is usually the problem at the heart of that hoary old "the GM should have written a novel instead" complaint. The problem isn't that certain stories are inappropriate for RP in any objective sense.  Rather, it's that there was a disconjunct between what the players were encouraged to focus their energies on, and what the system/GM kept trying to privilege as The Important Stuff.<br/><br/>I think Neel is right in his implication that the interactive aspect of RP can still often carry groups over a number of bumps related to (a), but some disconjuncts can't be gapped.<br/><br/>As for (b)...I have a good friend who considers the sort of games that I most enjoy "boring."  Then, he also considers the sort of <i>fiction</i> that I most enjoy 'boring.'  He himself reads exclusively action-oriented genre fiction, and his ideas about 'what makes a good game' reflect that genre preference.  <br/><br/>When it comes to those sorts of preferences, well, I think there comes a point where that's just...that.  I don't believe that my friend would ever be able to enjoy, say, "To the Lighthouse, the RPG," and really? That's okay.                        </div>

                            Sarah (SK), I agree with both your caveats. I wouldn't consider a game where the players can't touch/aren't interested in The Important Stuff (whatever it is) to be very good, and I was thinking of good games versus good novels. <br/>
<br/>
There are also novels which are such striking works of genius that I can appreciate them but can't really hope to reproduce them, but it still seems worthwhile to aim high. I bet there are games like that, too.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I probably should have realized that around <i>here</i>, caveat (a) goes without saying.  Heh, sorry, forgot where I was for a moment there.<br/><br/>I now find myself rethinking, though, mainly due to your own mention of books so good that you'd despair of trying to reproduce their virtues in an RPG, combined with my own example of "To the Lighthouse: the RPG."<br/><br/>I guess what I'm thinking here is: the particular skills of the game group probably have to be taken into account, and then combined with an understanding of what it is that <i>makes</i> a given novel so good, before you can judge whether the two types of quality are transferable.  <br/><br/>For example, if you wanted to play a game that would be like <i>To the Lighthouse,</i> I think that it would be relevant to ask yourself, honestly, two questions.<br/><br/>1. Can the people in your group narrate with anything even approximating Virginia Woolf's skill and elegance?<br/><br/>2. If you removed the scintillating prose style from <i>To the Lighthouse</i>, would you enjoy what you'd have left over?<br/><br/>Yeah.  So maybe there really are some types of premises that make for great novels, but are far more problematic for games.                        </div>

                            My rule goes like this: <br/><br/>If your premise tells one story, or presuposes the point, its probably good for a book. <br/><br/>If your premise opens up an area that lets people tell lots of different stories, its probably good for a game. <br/><br/>So, good book: two Jewish boys in New York learn how to deal with their own entraping history through the dream of a comic book character; good game: playing characters who have a real life and a fantasy in which they are heroes, and how they affect each other. Or, good book: For a lawman in the old west, temperance and even handedness is more important and likely to effect positive change than brutality or skill at violence; good game: You are a religious authority that comes into a town full of sin and must figure out how best to handle it. <br/><br/>But that's just me.                        </div>

                            I'll sort of echo what SK said.<br/>
<br/>
In a novel, with auteurship and centuries of technique to build upon, you can, with sufficient skill, pull off marvelously subtle and nuanced things.<br/>
<br/>
In a game, you're better off leaning towards melodrama and cliche, so that your fellow players have a common reference point from which to creatively build.<br/>
<br/>
It took me a while to figure this out.<br/>

                            Larry - I'm not so sure that gameing needs either melodrama or cliche to be good or fun. I think that we lean on both to make it easy to do the game stuff. That doesn't mean we aren't Nabokovs, it does seem to mean we take the easy way out for the sake of speed.<br/><br/>I wonder if Graham's Games of English writers might make something you would find a little less silly. I think we can do Faukner with a little effort.                        </div>

                            I don't think that I agree, Larry.  I think that some beautifully nuanced and subtle things can be accomplished in an RPG.  Hell, I've seen it happen.  If you aim for melodrama and cliche, on the other hand, you're unlikely to get anything much other than...melodrama and cliche.  Which is fine if that's what you want.  It usually isn't what I want.<br/><br/>What I meant was more along the lines of:<br/><br/>If the premise relies for its effect on the characters and players being <i>funny</i> - if it's a premise that doesn't achieve its effect without the humour - then you're screwed if you play with people who aren't very good at being funny.<br/><br/>If the premise relies for its effect on detailed elaboration of the characters' mental states - if it's a premise that doesn't achieve its effect if the narrative approach is purely external - then you're screwed if you're playing with people who are only willing to narrate from an external perspective.<br/><br/>And so forth.  Basically, what I'm saying is that the effectiveness of a given premise is dependent not only on the bare bones "whats" of the plot structure and such, but is also highly dependent on the "hows."<br/><br/>_Catch-22_ without the black humour isn't _Catch-22._  Remove the black comedy, and you don't really have the same premise at all, even if you retain the bare-bones structure of the plot.<br/><br/>I wouldn't try to play "To the Lighthouse: the RPG," because I don't think that I know anyone with the particular skills necessary to make that premise work.<br/><br/>If I played with Nabakov, on the other hand, then maybe I'd be willing to give it a try.  Then, I'd also be willing to give it a try if I played with my friend Eileen, who writes kick-ass internal monologues.                        </div>

                            On the "authors as good RPers" issue, I've played RPGs with NEA winning authors and poets, as well as professors of various types of writing (no one famous, unless you follow very esoteric literary circles), and I've honestly rarely been impressed with their RPing ability. The only ones who really did it were those who also did theatre or improv or the like. "Pure" writers aren't, in my experience, much better at RPGs on average than the norms.                        </div>

                            That doesn't surprise me, Brand.  I know that one of the reasons that I've migrated away from table-top and towards on-line RP over the past few years is that I feel so much more comfortable with my improvisational prose-writing skills than I do with my improvisational acting skills.                        </div>

                            A good book premise is one that tells you something that you want to hear.<br/>
<br/>
A good game premise insists that you tell others something that you want to say.<br/>

                            I think the distinction lies in the ability for the players, working with the GM in a dynamic way, to effect change once the actual game begins.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of the mistakes 'railroading' and such make are easily attributable to players simply not being able to effect the game world.  Something I've done for some time is to give the players a stake to have as theirs.  Command, factional politics, whatever takes player or GM fancy.   <br/>
<br/>
In telling the story of the game, the players should be able to be change agents.  A 'railroad' campaign denies players the opportunity to effect genuine change, and thus easily create a resentment.  The last few campaigns I've run, I've especially encouraged players to both weave their characters into the story, as well as have opportunity to create and modify existing story or 'premise' before play even begins.  It's all good for versimilitude, if players feel they as individuals (and as group participants) make a difference, then that's a good game.                        </div>

                            From my angle, it's all about audience.<br/><br/>A good premise for a novel is one that you can can entertain an audience with.<br/><br/>A good premise for a game is one that players can entertain each other with.<br/><br/><em>Slaughterhouse Five</em> would be, I suspect, a pretty abyssmal roleplaying game.  Vonnegut's habit of subverting his own storyline and repeatedly confounding expectations is highly entertaining when you're watching it happen.  It would be beyond frustrating to be trapped within it as a "player", with no foundation on which to stand and no authority with which to make assertations about the development of the fiction.<br/><br/><em>Dogs in the Vineyard</em> is a profoundly engaging game that, once you can get players past the initial oddity of the premise (we're Mormon Thought Police?  And that's supposed to be fun?) will grab most players by the throat because it turns out the game isn't actually about Mormon Thought Police and is in fact about the moral questions that the players really care about.  It facilitates the players connecting to the fiction by their creating it.  A <em>DitV</em> novel would be... really weird and disturbing and not engage its audience because, without that player input and the player-character avatar to negotiate the engagement, all you'd have is some wreck where some other guy's issues are thrown onto the page in all its bloody glory.  But you, reading the novel, wouldn't give a shit, and vast tracts of the novel would seem to be senseless violence.<br/><br/><em>Edit:</em> added dangling participle.                        </div>
