Some things here look "Yeah, duh, it's right there in the DMG" and some look "What, no, the DMG contradicts that".<br/><br/><br/><br/>So far, most RPGs I\u2019ve seen still require a bit of interpretation, almost annotation. I recently played in a game of Fiasco with a facilitator who had interpreted the game very differently from me (both ways worked). I\u2019m interested in writing down some of my house interpretations and even a few house rules for D&amp;D 5e. Feel free to follow suit with your own and/or discuss mine.<br/>This post is going to have some repeated stuff that I\u2019ve mentioned in other threads but it\u2019s like my official house rules document so that\u2019s why they\u2019re there.\n<h2><b>Interpretations</b></h2>\nAn interpretation is: \u201cThe RAW could be read this way, but it could also be read another way.\u201d<br/><br/><b>Feats &amp; Multiclassing</b> are optional and I disallow them. They are great so it feels like a shame to disallow them but that\u2019s where I stand right now. I sometimes look at charop forums and I want there to be a little more \u201cframes\u201d to your character. I don\u2019t hate charop but let\u2019s see what you can do within the existing classes. That\u2019s my take so far and this might change.<br/><br/>Same goes for <b>point buy</b>, the new system is very elegant but I\u2019m going with \u201croll or use the array\u201d.<br/><br/>The RAW says that the DM can choose whether <b>Monster HP and damage</b> is the listed average or rolled with the listed die combination, and that\u2019s the interpretation I\u2019m sticking with \u2014 I use the static numbers (so far all the time and I expect that to continue) but reserve the right to roll the dice. For HP, this has to be when monsters first take damage or when the players ask how many hit points it has, not later, but for damage it can change from swing to swing. I love the speed of the static numbers so that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to use, but I\u2019m not setting that for myself as a <em>rule</em>.<br/><br/>Character HP can represent <b>wounds and fatigue</b> and I\u2019m sticking with a broad interpretation of that. The rule that the top half is fatigue, the lower half is cuts and bruises and the 0-point cutoff is serious wounds I take as a very good guideline, not a rule and we\u2019ll riff on it rather than be stuck to it. The one rule is that the 0-point cutoff needs to be enough to make you unconscious.<br/><br/>AC represents both dodging and armor, both <b>whiffing and pinging</b> and I don\u2019t hold that the \u201ctop two\u201d points has to be your shield etc. Any miss can be described in any way, giving preference to whiffing on dex based characters and pinging on tanks.<br/><br/>Sometimes I see natural <b>high or low rolls</b> take a story component but I\u2019m deliberately trying to not include that in my own style. What do I mean? I\u2019ve seen groups that, when the die shows a 3, interpret the action as slapstick stumbling around like a dork and when the die show a 17 interpret the action as godlike prowess. The RAW supports misses, hits, and, on attacks only, crits and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going with. A miss, regardless of how low the natural roll is, can still be described as the character doing really well but because of some circumstance didn\u2019t inflict any HP loss on the enemy. Similarly, even a high hit is just a hit.<br/>I know the temptation <em>as a player</em> to add these things is big but here I am talking about what I aspire to do as a GM.<br/><br/>Speaking of misses, <b>failing forward</b> is something I\u2019ve experimented a little bit in games like Crime World and I\u2019ve chosen to not include it in my take on D&amp;D. I don\u2019t need a \u201c7\u20139 result\u201d. If you fail to pick a lock, go around. If you die, let\u2019s grieve (or take it as seriously or not seriously as you want) but make a new character.<br/>They way I see it, the point of \u201cfailing forward\u201d is to do just that, bring the story forward. But in my game, there is no story, there is only the world.<br/>And the point of partial successes such as PbtA\u2019s 7\u20139 or the equivalent in Fate Core is, if I understand correctly, to introduce some interesting bangs and story elements and twists. That\u2019s valid (and part of what makes PbtA tick). But, ideally, the world of D&amp;D is already interesting. Coming up with good 7\u20139 results is hard and I like it easy!<br/>That said, explicit stake setting is cool and if we (players and DM together) determine that success will mean \u201clock picked quickly\u201d and failure will mean \u201clock picked slowly, with consequences\u201d before a particular roll hit the table, I\u2019m onboard with that. But the default, if we haven\u2019t negotiated stakes, is hard failure.<br/><br/>The playtest rules had a section about <b>difficulty classes</b> that I vehemently disagreed with. It said that the DM could determine the DC after the dice had hit the table! That\u2019s not in my game and I try to make sure that the DC is known after you\u2019ve decided to roll (commited) but before the dice hit the table. Also, I need to have a very good reason to not make it 15. When I write prep, I have more flexibility and can choose between 10, 15 and 20 (for things such as locks), and commit that to paper.<br/><br/>Player\u2019s should remind me that <b>they get inspiration</b> (a good phrase is \u201cThat gives me inspiration, right?\u201d). You get inspiration for making meaningful choices in the game world that you wouldn\u2019t have done if you didn\u2019t have a particular characteristic. One of the clearest ways, but not the only way, to see that is that the choice got you into trouble.<br/><br/>Players <b>can give away their inspiration freely</b> within the group, provided that the recepient doesn\u2019t already have it. You don\u2019t need a reason.<br/><br/>Also, the action you <b>use inspiration</b> on doesn\u2019t neet to tie into your characteristics. It\u2019s just a reward, it can be used for any old boring roll. You should be trying to get advantage (from manipulation of circumstances and items in the game fiction) anyway so it\u2019s hard enough finding spots to use your inspiration.<br/><br/>The first two games I ran, <b>handling initative</b> was a confusing, messy affair. (We used the idea to have folded index card tents with names, placed in initiative order \u2014 the problem is that that idea still has to sort and somehow remember the numbers until the sorting is done.)<br/>Now I\u2019m using a piece of paper with 30 lines (descending) and jot down your character\u2019s first initial on the line that you rolled. Say you\u2019re Trym and you rolled 17 and have +2 init, I jot down a T on the 19th line. Then I can just see the order without re-sorting anything. That has worked great for a few sessions but I have another idea \u2014 I\u2019ll start a thread about it and maybe edit this post.<br/><br/><small>Wow, already remembered some more:</small><br/>For <em>social interaction</em> I try to (in my own head) keep in mind Laws\u2019 \u201cpetitioner/granter\u201d concept. If you have a strong reason/tactic/leverage, you get advantage and if you have a weak reason you get disadvantage. If you prefer to do the conversation more OOC, just roll the roll straight up. I\u2019ve seen \u201cpersuasion\u201d do some pretty far out things in other games and I want to be careful with this and need to think more about this.<br/><br/><b>Surprise rounds</b> and sneaking were great fun in Labyrinth Lord and I\u2019m happy with how the 5e RAW handles it, Dex (stealth) v Passive Wisdom (perception).<br/><br/>I don\u2019t like <b>asking for knowledge rolls</b> and it always looks jarring seeing in other\u2019s games: \u201cYou all make a history check. Oh ok, you, you and you know that this was founded in the year 1245\u201d. All of a sudden, characters know something that they didn\u2019t know before the dice hit the table. I don\u2019t value immersion highly, but these sorts of rolls are my big pet peeve (rather than a legitimate complaint). I have a hard time putting my finger on why they feel so weird. I might use passive rolls here, so I can say \u201cWizard, you know that it was founded in 1245\u201d. The skill is more useful for actually doing research.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438933/#Comment_438933" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-03T02:02:49+00:00" title="October  3, 2014  2:02AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 3, 2014 2:11AM by 2097.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Equipment and encumbrance</b> is interesting in this sort of game. Instead of abstractions like the \u201cgear\u201d in DW, I\u2019m experimenting with just using the shortcut in the raw that the Scholar\u2019s Pack, Explorer\u2019s Pack etc gives you. You need rope? Let\u2019s see what the book has listed for Explorer\u2019s Pack. Of course, that\u2019s only for my own characters and for pregens \u2014 other players can choose to use the shortcut or they can buy everything individually.<br/>For encumbrance, I\u2019m listing and adding everything in LB\u2014I\u2019m not, so far, using \u201cstones\u201d or \u201cslots\u201d here\u2014and using the \u201csimple encumbrance\u201d rule that the RAW offers. You can carry freely up to 15 times your strength. Heavy armor has strength thresholds. Encumbrance is important and interesting so I\u2019ll see if this simple rule is enough. The complex optional rule gives interesting choices of how much do I carry vs how fast can I move. The simple threshold rule just gives \u201cI can carry this much. What do take, and what do I leave behind?\u201d. I think that\u2019s an interesting enough choice, for now, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re using.<br/>The starter set pregens didn\u2019t have weights listed but I\u2019ve added that. My pregens do.<br/><br/><b>Pregens</b>, yes! I\u2019ve made a human champion, human life cleric, human evoker, dwarven champion, elven eldritch knight and hobbit thief. I went for the old school tropes. To that, you can add any background. I also of course allow and encourage building your own character if you have time but so far the pregens have seen a lot of use. Modifying the pregens \u2014 even rerolling stats \u2014 is fine, too.<br/><br/>As for <b>restrictions on classes and demi-types</b> I\u2019m looking sceptically at the dragonborn and the paladin. I\u2019ve never liked these two but so far I haven\u2019t made my mind up! I like some of the non-basic ones a lot, like tiefling, monk etc. I\u2019ll edit this when I make a decision. So far, the pregens I\u2019ve made have been an ok enough incentive to stick to the classics. If someone wants to go out of their way to make something else, that\u2019s just cool, right?<br/><br/>The <b>passage of time</b> is important. 5e uses minutes instead of 10-minute turns. I don\u2019t have this down yet. I need to practice this more with some more random-dungeon-generator solo play (which is what I\u2019ve used to learn a lot of the rules). I write down records of in-game days on A7-sized cards.\n<h2><b>Isomorphic changes</b></h2>\nAn isomorphic change is a rule that on the surface looks very different from RAW but is mathematically equivalent.<br/><br/>Here\u2019s what I do to speed up the DM\u2019s turn in the combat round. For each monster\u2019s attack, I pre-write the number that the dice has to meet or beat to hit a particular PC. For example, the goblin\u2019s scimitar hits Trym on a 10, Naeris on an 8 etc and deals 5 damage. I jot these numbers  down (or memorize) so I can quickly just use d20s and no further maths to see the results and spend my time describing the most salient hits.<br/>You can find these numbers by subtracting the to-hit from the AC \u2014 for example, Trym has an AC of 14 and the goblin hits at +4, so 14 - 4 means that any roll 10 or higher will hit \u2014 but I use another method that gives the same result. For the monsters, I\u2019ve noted <b>the tens-complement of the to-hit</b> (for goblins, that\u2019s 6 (because 10 - +4 = 6) and to find the meet-or-beat numbers I just add that six to the last digit of the ACs. So for Trym, it\u2019s 6+4 = 10. Since I jot that ten down anyway, the specific method doesn\u2019t matter much so this is kind of an unnecessary way of doing it \u2014 the point is to have the rolls noted so I don\u2019t need to add anything after the dice have hit the table. Really helps when I roll many attacks at once. (This comes from ACKS \u2014 I wrote about this in my thac10 thread.)\n<h2><b>Other changes</b></h2>\nHere I put out-and-out rules changes.<br/><br/><b>The 30LB limit</b> on the backpack has got to go since some of the standard pre-packed choices are over that. This seems like an oversight in the game \u2014 why would they give you a pre-filled backpack that would immediately burst. Until this is fixed, we just have to try to use common sense for backpack limits, keeping in mind the general encumbrance threshold.<br/><br/>Handling <b>chases</b> is easy in many newer games but difficult in D&amp;D because of the fixed speeds. Fate\u2019s \u201ccontests\u201d [which is great for chases], \u201cconflicts\u201d and \u201cchallenges\u201d division is one of the things I liked there, but here we don\u2019t have it. I need to look at how ACKS does it, because I remember that it was some unusual way but I don\u2019t remember how, and how other retroclones handle it, but for now, I have two ways. One is to simply do it in combat using the fixed speeds, dash actions etc. This hasn\u2019t been wholly satisfying but is pretty seamless from the fighting rules, which is usually when we need it. The other idea, which I thought of today, is to do that (fixed speeds, dash actions etc) but reroll initiative each round, perhaps using athletics or con instead of dex depending on the nature of the chase. It matters a lot who gets to use their speed first, and people aren\u2019t rolling attacks. The results of \u201cinitative rolls\u201d could be described in various interesting ways. We\u2019ll see.<br/>(My first idea was to, in chases only, change the fixed speeds with -10, +d20 so a speed of 25 would become d20 +15 but I\u2019ve fallen out of love with the idea. Too hard to teach, too unlike D&amp;D.)\n<h2><b>Playstyle choices</b></h2>\nSo far, especially in these pre-DMG times, 5e is a bit of a rorschach test. Here\u2019s how I want to run it.<br/><br/>Places, items, monsters and people should ideally be <b>prepared ahead of time</b>, not made up on the fly. The prep can consist of just making sure random tables is available, e.g. I can use a \u201cpocket contents\u201d table rather than specifying what\u2019s in every monsters pockets \u2014 the point is to avoid fiating it up on the fly, not to decide things in advance.<br/><br/>This is especially important for things with <b>numbers, such as monster stats</b>. These things should be determined ahead of game and not changed on the fly.<br/><br/>The prep can\u2019t cover everything and there will be gaps, but ideally the answer to any question will be in the prep. Paradoxically, I like it when the <b>prep is skeletal</b>. I don\u2019t need the whole life story of the 4 bandits in the room when I have a name table and pocket-contents-table available so I\u2019ll just write \u201c4 Bandits\u201d in the room and that\u2019s enough for prep.<br/><br/>Until the DMG comes out, I haven\u2019t settled on a canonical <b>stocking algorithm</b> for the locations in the prep. I\u2019m using my best judgment but eagerly anticipate the DMG for this. If that disappoints, I\u2019ll go to the methods from retroclones or older editions. For me, rules about what types of threats and rewards the DM can place in the world is super important. The fact that the players can go anywhere in the game world makes it less important, and less of a problem than in \u201cpath\u201d games, but it\u2019s still important.<br/><br/>So much for what should be prepped. I also have to note that <b>story should not be prepped</b>, and neither should any particular sequence in which the characters interact with elements and locations in the game world. My ideal to have many things which with the players can choose to engage or not.<br/><br/>I\u2019ll even go as far as to say <b>\u201cthere is no story\u201d</b> (yeah, I know the name of this forum) in my game. I\u2019m clutching hard to the \u201cexploration, conflict, interaction\u201d trinity, not story. \u201cYou\u2019ve entered a fantastic world \u2014 what do you do?\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean nothing is happening \u2014 LMoP\u2019s background and primary discovery is an ideal here, as are the borderland tags in Red Tide.<br/><br/>So far I\u2019ve found great help in Red Tide when it comes to prepping and I also have geomorphs that I\u2019ve used heavily. I have a long list of \u201cthings to get inspiration from\u201d such as random Magic or Everway cards, story cubes, the Dungeon Alphabet etc.<br/><br/>As for things in mind when actually running the game, my ideal, that I\u2019m so far pretty far from attaining, is <b>brevity and clarity</b>. Brevity means that I should be very careful with my time. I could go on and on to describe a cave in a moody way but you\u2019re here to play a game, not listen to my tales. And I\u2019d rather enter a question-answer dialog, make the game conversational rather than a monolog. The players are already competing hard for spotlight and talking-time so I must be careful. Clarity means that I should always list some options if it\u2019s unclear to the party what they can do, and prod them along with more info (or reminders) if they have trouble deciding. Even if they\u2019re talking in character, doing things is usually more fun than planning things especially if the planning is done in a quarrelsome way. Also: talk too much and the monsters hear you!<br/><br/>Have fun with D&amp;D folks!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438934/#Comment_438934" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-03T02:14:41+00:00" title="October  3, 2014  2:14AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For initiative, I roll once for the monsters to set the target number for the players.<br/><br/>Any player who meets or beats that number goes before the monsters.

We used group initative in the Labyrinth Lord games and that was great, so quick and so many synergies, and your twist on that is just as quick, but also rewards individuals with high init scores.<br/><br/>I love how it doesn\u2019t use any tools and how straight-forward it is and I\u2019m still having it in mind as a candidate to switch to.<br/><br/>But here\u2019s what my thinking on it is so far:<br/>In the group initative, all the monsters go at once, which is fine if they\u2019re just a bunch of goblins but less interesting if they\u2019re more varied types. (I\u2019m not sure \u2014 with your way, if I roll all the attacks at once and one of the goblins and one of the wolves hit, I can say just that and keep their round shorter and more salient, and that\u2019s great.)<br/>5e with all the lair actions and legendary actions really seem to encourage to switch it up.<br/>It\u2019s like the board games HeroQuest compared to Castle Ravenloft. In the former, all of the monsters go at once in a long boring overlord turn. In CR, the monsters are more divided up between players and that\u2019s interesting.<br/>If that\u2019s interesting enough to be worth the hassle of not using your simple rule, that\u2019s another story.\n<blockquote>What's wrong with paladins?</blockquote>\nFor me the paladins and the dragonborn have the same problem: it seems weird to me that a level 1 character has this.<br/>Paladins in my mind are still like the twelve best knights in the world, I\u2019m not used to the FRPG meaning of the word yet. And they kind of step on what I see the cleric as, this bad-ass van helsingesque tanky undead fighter. A paladin that you could become at like level 9 or so, I would be wholly onboard with that.<br/><br/>The troubles some people report with paladin\u2019s mechanical ties to lawful goodness being problematic I haven\u2019t encountered yet because I have actually never really seen one at a game table!<br/><br/>As far as I understand it, a paladin originally was a choice that became available if you rolled luckily on the stats.

When asked if I worry that players will cheat, I shake my head. If a player cheats, that's on them. It tends not to matter all that much anyway.<br/><br/>I like 13th Age's <b>interpretation of hit points</b> as "how not dead you are," so that's what I tend to use. I usually interpret loss of hit points as getting winded, losing tactical advantage, getting into a bad position, and so on. You're not necessarily bleeding till the very end.<br/><br/>I <b>interpret PC failures</b> as PCs doing awesome things but not succeeding, rather than them whiffing and looking stupid. For example, on a miss, the fighter slams his axe down and the hobgoblin catches it on his shield with a grunt. <br/><br/>Players <b>narrate the consequences of their attacks</b> most of the time. I'll say, "Nope, 15 misses. What happens?" and they'll describe their attack and why it missed. In a similar vein, we tend to do out-of-character description before the roll, and fictional narration after the roll. "I'm attacking the orc... 15, a miss. So I bring my sword around in a wide arc, making the orc sergeant behind me suck in his gut to keep from getting eviscerated, then I whirl around into a horse stance, guard up, as his axe comes toward me."<br/><br/>I always <b>determine difficulty classes</b> before the dice are rolled. That's just fair cricket.<br/><br/>I let players adjudicate their own <b>Inspiration</b>. I'm happy to throw down a ruling if a player asks me, but they really don't need to ask me. Players are free to award Inspiration to other players <i>as if they were the DM</i> (i.e., out of the bowl in the middle, and not just out of their own Inspiration). Inspiration flows freely at my table. Perhaps most controversial here, players can <b>spend Inspiration</b> after a failed roll to gain an Advantage reroll. Anything to keep Inspiration flowing is a good thing to me.<br/><br/>On a <b>natural 20</b>, we narrate really cool successes. On a <b>natural 1</b>, we narrate really cool (awful) failures. Other high and low rolls tend to be narrated normally, but we might interpret small damage vs. high damage differently in narration.<br/><br/>For <b>initiative</b>, I tend to keep a card for each player and sort them in order. I love Sandra's idea for passing around a numbered initiative sheet that players initial on the right line, but it's still slower than the other method I want to use. I roll one initiative for the monsters, probably based on the boss. We divide initiative into three phases: before the monsters, the monsters, and after the monsters. I'll be, like, "Who beat a 15?" They all handle their attacks in whatever order they please. Then I handle the monsters. Then everyone who didn't go yet gets their turns. Repeat until done. (Oh, you already talked about that.)<br/><br/>I <b>tell monster ACs to the players</b> so that combats go faster. Some players remember them, some don't and still ask me "does a 16 hit?" every time. It still speeds up things a little.<br/><br/>Depending on the setting I am running (always a homebrew), I might <b>restrict PC races and classes</b>. In my Lasthold setting, for example, Dragonborn just didn't fit. I added Mechanica, though, which are my setting's gearwork equivalent of Warforged. Elves and Dwarves are probably totally unsuitable PC races because they're The Enemy in this world. I interpret halflings as "half human, half dwarf," and gnomes as "half elf, half dwarf." Tiefling really don't fit at all in Lasthold. All the classes are available, and I'm working up a decent Artificer class.<br/>\n<h2>Play Style</h2>\nI tend to <b>make stuff up as I go</b> within any prep I may have done. I'm not great at prep but when I do, I stick to it. If I improvise an encounter, I probably base it on a "fair encounter" for the players based on environment and level. If the players have wandered into something above their heads, I give them clear warnings first.<br/><br/>I <b>don't prep story</b>, but I do consider possible outcomes. What if the party doesn't stop the gang lord? What happens next? What happens if they defeat his gang but don't kill the leader? <br/><br/>Regarding <b>brevity and clarity</b>, I read my table and if they're the kind of group that enjoys the moody descriptions, then I give them that. If they seem bored by it, I will only give them the important details in brief.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438954/#Comment_438954" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-03T09:50:02+00:00" title="October  3, 2014  9:50AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff, <a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a>, as always!<br/><br/>Oh, BTW, here's my crazy stat-rolling scheme: 12+d6 three times.

They work pretty well mathematically. And, although they seem counter-intuitive at first, they become natural very quickly (once you've performed the roll a handful of times).<br/><br/>Here they are:<br/><br/><br/>1. Roll 3d6. Once you see the results, take your highest die and change it to a "6".<br/><br/>If you already have a 6, just add the dice together normally.<br/><br/>For example, you roll 1, 3, and 4. Normally this would be an 8. Instead, you pick up the "4" and change it to a "6". Now your score is 10.<br/><br/>Minimum ability score is an 8, maximum is still 18 (and no more common than with 3d6).<br/><br/><br/>2. Set out a d4, with the "4" showing. Now roll 2d6+1d8. Look at all four numbers on the table, and discard the highest. The remaining three dice are your total.<br/><br/>E.g., you roll a 3, a 1, and a 5. Your d4 shows a 4. Discarding the 5 (the highest result), you get 1+3+4, for a total of 8.<br/><br/>Minimum score is a 6, with 13 and higher being close to (but slightly lower than with) 3d6. (For example, you have 0.35% chance of an 18 instead of 0.46%.)<br/><br/><br/>3. Roll a d4, a d6, and a d8.<br/><br/>Look at your highest die:<br/><br/>* If the d8 rolls the highest result, just total up the dice normally.<br/><br/>* If the d4 or the d6 has the highest result, change that die to its maximum value. (If they're tied, you can choose the d6.)<br/><br/>E.g., you roll a 3 on the d8, a 1 on the d4, and a 4 on the d6. You can change your d6 to a 6, for a total of 10.<br/><br/>Like method <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, above, but still allows for the occasional low score (minimum of 4).<br/><br/><br/>I'm not sure if any of these are appropriate for 5E, but I'll include them here just in case!<br/><br/><i>A potentially easier way to do this kind of thing, of course, is to make a custom deck, and "deal" hands for each stat. This allows you to generate exactly the odds you want, and means every character's stats add up to the same number (which may be desirable for some games).</i><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438962/#Comment_438962" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-03T12:01:26+00:00" title="October  3, 2014 12:01PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I was working on a D&amp;D variant for which I needed stats similar to a 3d6 spread, but with most stats falling in the 8-15 range, without changing the odds of higher stats too much.</blockquote>How about 4d4 + 1 ?
