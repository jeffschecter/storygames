For instance, Lesser teleportation allows one to teleport to a location no farther than a few hundred feet away and only a location he knows while Greater teleportation allows one to teleport himself and a great number of others miles away<br/>\n<br/>\nActions that require resolving are done like so...<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Choose one applicable Attribute, Skill and Power. If no Skill or Power applies, no biggie. You just won't be as proficient.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) You roll the appropriate Rank Die for both Attribute and Skill (if a Skill applies). Powers add a +1 per Grade if one is applied.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Dice Explode if the maximum value is rolled. Allows one to roll next Rank Die up. These dice can explode as well. When D12s explode, the value is increased by 1 instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if the range of numbers is too small... or if the mechanic just isn't interesting enough. The rest of the game intends to be pretty rules lite where Skills are created by the players.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny observations, comments, questions, criticisms and what-not are welcome. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232529/#Comment_232529" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-15T18:48:00+00:00" title="September 15, 2009  6:48PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So would you be using savage worlds 4 target number too then?

It allows folks who would normally be incompetent to rise up and do something heroic every now and again.<br/>\nThat said, if the static TN of 4 idea is used... I might just remove exploding dice altogether.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">[cite]Posted By: whiteknife[/cite]So would you be using savage worlds 4 target number too then? What about the "wild dice" to simulate "PC's are better than everyone else"</div>\n</blockquote>\nThat's not a bad idea. I've never played Savage Worlds before, only looked over the rules once. Does the static 4 TN work well? I understand there are modifiers and what-not. I wonder if I would need to change how powers work, considering that even a +1 to a roll is pretty major.<br/>\nThe way Attributes and Skills interact... it causes Skills to pretty much become the Wild Die except in this game if you have a Rank 5 Attribute and a Rank 5 Skill, you will be rolling 1D12/1D12 and taking the higher result. The way PCs rise above the rabble is with Powers and a Fate/Fortune Point system like that found in WFRP (renewable Action point resource that can be permanently drained in an emergency).<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Also, how are you going to determine the grades on powers?<br/>\nOne thing I find with those "powers grade" systems is that some powers you only need one rank of(once you can do it you don't need to improve it when you could be improving better things instead).

The setting revolves around folks that evolve rapidly due to an unexplained event. I'm keeping that part pretty generic as well... but what I'm trying to say is, since there are so few Powers I have rolled all of the 'utility' abilities into different powers. Thus, each should advance in an interesting way from one Grade to the next. Since the powers are limited each player is suppose to have to make 'tough' decisions regarding the placement of their Powers (though a solid character concept would make it easier!).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232560/#Comment_232560" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-16T00:00:41+00:00" title="September 16, 2009 12:00AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">[cite]Posted By: Zac in Davis[/cite]I'm kind of intrigued that keeping your rating low isn't a huge disadvantage: you have a 25% chance of exploding a Rank 1 ability, and (overall) about a 4% chance of exploding your d4&lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt;the d6 that comes next, and so on...<br/>\nSo yeah, I'm kind of intrigued by it, but I can't help but be intrigued by the math (this is me thinking out loud; I'm sure you've thought about it already ^_^)</div>\n</blockquote>\nYou've certainly put more thought into than I have, friendo. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/><br/>\nSee the above for the reason that I may bump the exploding bit off.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">On the subject of powers, I think letting multiple major characters possess the same kind of power would be wonky, unless it's the kind of super power that's pretty common (different characters with different levels of super strength wouldn't be too weird for me, but different characters with, say, different levels of teleportation seems a little esoteric unless they're wielding very different power sources).</div>\n</blockquote>\nCertain Powers are very generic...

If you're making a game that features humans suddenly developing magic/super/whatev powers, then it's all right to design something that isn't "comprehensive" - i.e. doesn't need to include the possibility of magic fire demons to be complete.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232624/#Comment_232624" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-16T10:35:53+00:00" title="September 16, 2009 10:35AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Its been a while since I've looked at Donjon. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/> Perhaps I'll take another lookie-loo and read up on precisely what you mean.<br/>\nMy original vision involved pre-wrote up powers that could be randomly generated via a table...

During Character Creation you either roll up two or choose two.<br/>\nRolling them isn't as painful as it sounds. You roll 2D20, and pick one for the X axis and the other for the Y axis. Then you do it once more. Gives you a small amount of control over what you receive.<br/>\n<br/>\n[align=center]<img alt="a9micp.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://i27.tinypic.com/a9micp.jpg"/>[/align]<br/>\nOnce you have your Key Words, you are allowed to create 3 Aspects (perhaps a better term should be used, Extensions maybe?). These Aspects must relate in some way to your Key Words, either one or both. Aspects must be narrowly defined but are only as detailed as the players at the table agree is necessary.<br/>\nThis means that if your group agrees on it, you may have to define how many feet you can teleport, whether or not you can teleport to places you've never seen before, if you can teleport others with you, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone has a Skill called Power Control that serves as a way to channel your Powers and make your rolls better.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts a rough idea, but how does it look folks? Or, should I create a new thread for this topic altogether?<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggestions for better or more Key Words is also welcome. =D                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232729/#Comment_232729" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-16T20:39:31+00:00" title="September 16, 2009  8:39PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2009 8:42PM by MacLeod.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is the mechanic "in motion" so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\n<u>Roy Gulvin</u><br/>\n<b>Occupation:</b> Mercenary<br/>\n<b>Weapons:</b> Katana, Various Small Firearms<br/>\n<b>Keywords:</b> Sound, Speed<br/>\n<br/>\n[align=center]<u>Extensions</u>[/align]<br/>\n<i>Silence Is Golden</i>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Roy may project a field of complete silence around his body.
