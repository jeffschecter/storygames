The GM describes the situation, turns to me, and asks "What does your character do?" All the other players wait with bated breath to hear my answer!<br/><br/>OR maybe I'm playing a solitaire game, the system provides me with a system, (perhaps randomly-generated, perhaps established by the system's designer) and prompts me to ask myself "What does your character do?"<br/><br/>To me, at least, it's the same sort of situation. I respect that some people don't think there'd be a point to solo play... but I think you can engage in all the same creative processes, given a good enough system that provides interesting prompts and challenges, and that reacts to your input in a clever enough way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310565/#Comment_310565" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T06:23:42+00:00" title="February  2, 2011  6:23AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Suna</cite>Hi Graham, but doesn't that negate the assumption that RPG is a social activity?</blockquote>\nYes, sure.

If you're playing alone, then you don't have to agree or compromise with anyone but yourself, that's considerably easier to do. In fact it's neglectable. So the Forge theory doesn't really take solo play into consideration. That doesn't mean it's not possible.<br><br>People have been playing solo for ages. The old Red Box included a solo introductory adventure. I'd venture a guess that people have been just writing up characters, creating worlds and rolling random encounters all by themselves since the 70's. It depends what you consider to be "play" in this case. RPGs most certainly include plenty of opportunities for "lonely fun" from the get-go. Is that integral to the whole, or something you can ignore?<br/><br/>As I said in Per's thread, I think RPGs don't need two or more people, but they <i>do</i> need a dialogue (and an imaginary space). Having more than one person is the easiest way to get a dialogue, but you can have it with a game text or game rules or some randomly generated feedback or even yourself.<br/><br/>Going by the lumpley principle, system is how we agree to what happens in the game and a replacement of the (group's) default interactions. It's super-easy to agree with myself, so I could just agree with everything that happens in my imagination and then I guess it's simple daydreaming. So the role of the system here is to "disagree" with me, to replace my default agreement with myself, to introduce elements that are against my natural overwhelming unity of consent. So me and the game are now in a dialogue: I can roleplay, put myself in the shoes of a character and decide what he does and the game must respond with things that are <i>not</i> what I'd otherwise simply imagine, and I respond to that, etc.<br/><br/>So I believe solo play is entirely possible (interestingly enough I don't consider crpgs to be "real" rpgs). I don't think it appeals much to me, and it will never be big, but as Graham says I think it's useful to think about it and explore this territory.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310588/#Comment_310588" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T07:59:08+00:00" title="February  2, 2011  7:59AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was already <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13518" rel="nofollow">another giant thread</a> where some folks brought up similar concerns.

You cant use the word to claim a very small exact practice as the only valid form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310611/#Comment_310611" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T10:27:25+00:00" title="February  2, 2011 10:27AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All I really know for sure is that with the experiments I've had with solo gaming, it helps to be a bit more removed from individual characters and more enthused about an overall situation, and seeing what funky directions that takes.<br><br>I suspect that may be why it is easier to write a solo wargame than a solo rpg or storygame.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_310614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310614/#Comment_310614" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T10:41:14+00:00" title="February  2, 2011 10:41AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2011 10:42AM by Stephen P.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>But RPGs don't have a central definition.

Hell, lots of people use the phrase "role-playing game" to describe those activities that you do in corporate team-building activities, and those are <i>certainly</i> a different beast than anything we talk about here.<br/><br/>EDIT: Crossposted x2. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310633/#Comment_310633" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-02T11:47:03+00:00" title="February  2, 2011 11:47AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been working for a while now on an article identifying player motives. It's a little more focused on LARP than tabletop play, primarily because I think there are a lot of potential player motives in LARP that haven't been identified and discussed well to date.<br/><br/>I've got a list of about 16 so far. They're sort of a combination between Stance and Creative Agenda, because I find those to be too high level.<br/><br/>Anyway, several of the motives can be satisfied in solo play and several can't.<br/><br/>So mostly I'm reiterating the idea that people don't identify solo RPGs as valid because they are driven by motives that can't possibly be satisfied in solo play.<br/><br/>And yes, I'll post the article when it's ready. I hope this group finds it worthy of discussion, even though it isn't developed from a StoryGame-centric perspective.<br/><br/>In fact, I might post an in-progress version soonish to see if the StoryGame crowd has some ideas to help firm up some of the concepts I'm presenting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
