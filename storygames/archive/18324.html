It's about road trips, self-discovery, and mix tapes. It's an ode to indie darlings like Little Miss Sunshine and Wristcutters. And in 2010 my print run was dwindling down to the last remaining books. <i>Great</i>, I thought to myself. <i>This gives me an opportunity to make a few minor edits and address some accessibility concerns that a couple people brought up</i>. Those quick edits would only take me about two months, surely.<br/><br/>Three years later, those two months worth of edits are complete! Ribbon Drive has been revised, lain out anew, and republished.<br/><br/>It's now available as a booklet for fifteen dollars (22-page, full-colour, digest-sized), or a PDF for eight dollars (PDF bundle includes three versions: spreads, singles, printer-friendly). You can purchase either on <a href="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/ribbon-drive/" rel="nofollow">the Ribbon Drive page</a>. Books are being printed and shipped to IPR's warehouse now, and the first wave will be sent out to customers within about two weeks.<br/><br/>You can also buy the book direct from <a href="http://www.magcloud.com/browse/issue/543338?__r=77263" rel="nofollow">the printer, MagCloud</a>. It's still fifteen dollars. If you do that, email me the receipt (mcdaldno at gmail) and I'll hook you up with the PDF. MagCloud prints quick and ships cheap.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMAG0263-e1367290309810.jpg"/><br/><br/>If you've played the game in the past, I'd love it if you posted about your experiences in this thread.

Could you talk about that?</blockquote>\nSure! I don't know that I picked that phrase super carefully, so don't read too much into it. Here are some of the things that I meant by it:<br/><br/><b>The layout of the previous edition, while gorgeous, posed readability issues for some</b>. I heard from a number of people that they were unable to finish the text because some pages were low-contrast, or over-stimulating for their ADHD, etc. I wanted this new layout to be more clean and visible.<br/><br/><b>The previous edition failed to teach players how to handle inter-character conflict</b>. While there aren't any mechanics for this as such, there are principles to follow and bits of the system to look to for inspiration. And in the new edition, those are unpacked and followed up with a lengthy example. In short, I address the concerns that Graham Walmsley and GB Steve raise <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=28624.0" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/><b>Since then, I've also revised the text and added some suggestions based off years of further play</b>. The text is still pretty similar to the first version. But it's tighter and better now, because my design and writing has elevated over the past four years. The rules are still the same, but the presentation is more polished.<br/><br/><b>The previous edition was expensive to produce and unwieldy to sell</b>. A game about mix CDs? Clearly I should package it with a compilation CD featuring 11 indie artists, and contain the whole thing inside a DVD case with a full-colour wrap around it. While a neat idea, it was a bit of a production nightmare. It cost a lot per-unit to assemble, involved 4 components from 4 different companies, required me to sell at a high price point to make any money, and in the end wasn't adding value for most customers over a simple booklet. The new version is beautiful but affordable (and easier to ship).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo" title="w00hoo"><img alt="w00hoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/395/nB2PXS15U6BFQ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/w00hoo">w00hoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413164/#Comment_413164" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-30T01:44:24+00:00" title="April 30, 2013  1:44AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2013 1:45AM by w00hoo.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If you've played the game in the past, I'd love it if you posted about your experiences in this thread.

That is a fantastic thing.<br/><br/>I have had some of my deepest roleplaying experiences playing this game. While at its heart it is ludicriously simple this simplicity hides a core that just allows you to easily create stories that focus in on the important stuff and throw away everything else. I've played with 3 or 4 players (I'd say 4 is the optimum if you can get them) which means 6-8 futures, and they are where the game truly rocks. Each player has 2 futures, 2 things that they will decide 'is it my destiny to make this happen at some point in my life, or will it just never come to pass' and those are the things that you talk about during the road trip. Sure, we mention other stuff, but other stuff doesn't matter, it's not the burning issue in the characters heart. So you go back to futures, and you focus in and when it all gets a bit much, when the questions start getting a bit hard, you look at what futures other people have and you go 'yeah, right, but what about your problem with that thing?' and you pass that buck straight on to something equally as important.<br/><br/>And while this is all happening, in the background, songs are playing. And the facilitator (if it's me) has mucked about with the volume levels constantly, but they are there, just in your hearing and if the CD comes to an end, you notice it so quickly even though you didn't really know what they were adding. But more importantly at some point you'll be in the middle of an intense scene and that track will come on the CD player and it'll fit with what is happening so tightly it's like god is soundtracking your game. I'm yet to come to the end of a game without players looking around and agreeing when <b>that</b> song came on <b>then</b>... Awesome.<br/><br/>Be it Fast Car by Tracey Chapman, or You've Got a Friend in Me by Randy Newman (in the middle of a touching 'coming out' scene between two old college friends in San Francisco) or The Kid's Aren't Alright by Offspring (which had the whole game just stop to listen to the track because it was <b>so right</b> at that point 'wait, you don't get it, this isn't the dream, this is the loser car. You are in the loser car.' (opening chords by the Offspring). There will be tracks that just sing out.<br/><br/>I've almost always played with one new face at the table (conventions remember) and once we ironed out a few things it has always sung. I've played it a couple of times knowing everyone there and it has been amazing. On one occasion our only regret was that we bothered to break scenes, as the 4 hours came to an end we realised we could have started the conversation as the car left the airport and finished as it pulled up at the crematorium with no need to break in between. I came back from the opening Con of the year and spent the next four weeks crafting new CD's because I realised I was getting to know my first batch of 6. I've played with them once so far, I can't wait to do more.<br/><br/>Some advice before you go and buy this game (go now, buy this game, come back).<br/><br/>1- Realise what it can't do. It can't do action movies (or at least those are the ones that have failed for us) I've probably tried two chase movies with it and the tension just doesn't work. This is for low key road movies. For action movies, pick something with some dice (bit glib, but...)<br/>2- Everyone in the car is important, don't carry NPC's long distances. The odd NPC works, they can even recur a little, but when you are creating the car, everyone doing the journey has to be a PC. If you're reluctant to make someone a PC, ask why. Do they <b>need</b> to be there? If yes, then who needs to be there less. Lose them.<br/>3- Find a space you can play music and lounge about in. This is a great game to play relaxing on a couch. It probably doesn't play well with other games nearby though (I've never actually tried).<br/>4 - Make some CD's, I've done 2 batches of 6 now, the single biggest block to getting people to play the game is the feeling that they need to turn up prepared with a CD and lyrics. Do it in advance, if someone brings one (it's happened twice in all the games I've run I think) then excellent. But don't make it a requirement to play. Sit, work out some tracks, mix up some CD's. It's fun if addictive. I'd say you need at least 4 CD's although you may only use 3.<br/>5 - Give yourselves a decent wedge of time. For four players with set up it pretty much always runs 4 hours give or take 30 minutes. For three players it goes quicker. I'd not try playing with more than four. I'd have no problem playing with 2 if it came to it but it never has. A caveat for that, games in the UK seem to run a bit longer than the same games in the US, I have no idea why.<br/><br/>I will put my hand up as a bit of a Joe fanboy, but equally I'll blame games like this for that. This is truly something you should try if you like making stories with friends, or people who might become friends. I wouldn't hesitate in suggesting that Ribbon Drive is something you just must play at least once :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413165/#Comment_413165" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-30T03:05:12+00:00" title="April 30, 2013  3:05AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2013 3:51AM by EpistolaryRichard.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My Ribbon Drive experience</span></b><br/><br/>Because of the musical element, RB doesn\u2019t get pitched a lot where I game (Meets and Cons) \u2013 for folk who game around people\u2019s houses it\u2019s a lot more accessible. It\u2019s only been pitched once near me and I was running a game in other slot at the same time. Then serendipity struck \u2013 both our games were short players and so I cancelled my game and bundled into RB and I was so glad I did. <br/><br/>To be honest, I wasn\u2019t taken by the premise. I live in the UK where road trips are more usually nightmares of traffic jams, contraflows, hyper-bored kids and the bizarre things you find in service station gift shops, and if you drive for more than a few hours in any one direction then you\u2019ve probably fallen off the edge. I don\u2019t \u2018get\u2019 the joy of the open road, but \u2013 as I grew to realise when I started playing \u2013 you don\u2019t actually need to.<br/><br/>This really is the lightest of light games mechanically speaking and it\u2019s all the better for it. Four people sitting around a table talking is not so physically different from four people sitting in a car talking. I even found it easier to larp it up a bit, turning my chair from the others when I was driving so that I would have to turn my head to look at them. I\u2019ve seen threads talking about \u2018director-stance\u2019 and how it prevents immersion in a GM-less game, well this was a GM-less game in which I was immersed up to my neck. I've never had as much character bleed in a GM-less game as I had with RB.<br/><br/>So what was so special about our game? On the face of it, nothing. Our game had a group of old friends from high school who'd all tried (and failed in various ways) to make it in New York, head back to their hometown of Spartenberg, Illinois to watch their old school be demolished. So far, so ordinary. <br/><br/>But ordinary, I think, was the reason for its success (I think it\u2019s a little like Penny for My Thoughts in that respect). This is the only game I\u2019ve played, but of others I\u2019ve heard about that have gone less well have suffered because the players created a set-up that was trying too hard to be interesting and had included action adventure elements. The key element of road movies that Joe has focused on here is that it\u2019s not about the destination, it\u2019s not even about the journey, it\u2019s about an internal life-changing decision that each of the characters is trying to make and that you can\u2019t answer until the journey is finished. <br/><br/>The journey itself is a way for you as a player to get to know your character well enough to be able to make that decision for them. Again, a little like Penny where you learn/create the character as you play, but with RB it\u2019s happening \u2018under the hood\u2019 as opposed to being the primary driver as it is in Penny.<br/><br/>What RB provides is the structure to have that process of discovery \u2013 again, the structure isn\u2019t explicit like in Fiasco, more like Forsooth! where the structure is implicit from the genre. This is a road movie, what does that mean? It means that you\u2019re fundamentally trapped with these people (again, another mistake I heard of was adding an NPC to the car for an extended period); that this is an occasion where people get to know each other deeper; it permissions you to ask questions, even more personal questions than you would before; it permissions you to have silences, absolutely nothing wrong with having long silences in RB. And these lead to the structure of:<br/>-\tyou talk and catch-up<br/>-\tyou talk and reminisce<br/>-\tyou talk about shit, any shit you can<br/>-\tand when you've finally exhausted all the shit, then you\u2019ve got nothing left but to say the things to each other that you really _want_ to say, maybe that you've really want to say or ask for years<br/>-\tand when you've gone through that, you have a deeper truth about your character and that's what helps you make your decision, and then you get to have the catharsis of reaching your destination. <br/><br/>I\u2019ve heard of other people having success with RB with characters who are meeting for the first time, but our characters had \u2018strong\u2019 relationships (i.e. they knew each other already and had known each other for years) and I was very glad about. If your characters don\u2019t know each other then it\u2019s so much harder to create for each other, and having others create for your character is what\u2019ll give you the info about your character to get to know them better, otherwise you might as well just sit in a room and make your character\u2019s decision on your own at the very start.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve written this much and never once mentioned the music because that\u2019s how it feels when you play. It\u2019s never in the way, but if you need it, it\u2019s there. Different games try different ways to help the group create the characters and starting situation and I rail against those that don\u2019t and just say \u2018Create a character and agree a situation between yourselves\u2019. RB is virtually in the latter camp (caveat, I haven't actually read it, just been instructed by a facilitator), but where you most need the inspiration (in getting going) is where RB puts the music at the forefront and gets you there. After that, the music fades into the background, but it remains an absolutely essential element of the game \u2013 ostensibly in providing inspiration when players dry \u2013 but more critically for me in permissioning the long silences. Long silences when there\u2019s music playing are reflective and refreshing.

The genre of the low-key road movie does less than nothing for me, I actively dislike it, but I was hoping that I could still enjoy playing the game.

I know that any trip that starts with "Hey Ya" will end with nervous second chances and unorthodox families. When I hear "Selling the Wind," I remember the ER, the hitchhiker, and the waitress whose day I ruined.<br/><br/>There are so many songs that, when I hear them now, I get transported back to moments I had with this game. It's a pretty cool phenomenon - a delayed impact that you're reminded of whenever you hear that song on the radio.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Edmoo" title="Edmoo"><img alt="Edmoo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Edmoo">Edmoo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413500/#Comment_413500" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-04T03:43:41+00:00" title="May  4, 2013  3:43AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've still never played this, and I reallyreally must.<br/>A lot of my gaming friends are 'non-gamers', or rather they were, and I think this would appeal to the actors among them particularly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
