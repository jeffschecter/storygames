I'm going to roll up my sleeves, crack my neck, spit in my hands and give you another try, you little bastard.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe're playing in Eberron, so off the bat there's a wonderfully rich source world to rely on, and no shortage of character hooks that the players should be familiar with or intrigued by. I feel like I'm pretty well-prepared, here's my set-up:\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\n<li><b>Initial Game Session:</b> Character burning. Before a pencil touches a character sheet, spread out the map, overview recent history (end of the last war), and point out the geography for the character's starting location and the recent politics of that area. Players begin brainstorming how they want to be involved or related to those politics (or come up with their own politics/events/organizations and I veto it or figure out how to work it in). Ever PC comes up with an initial goal/quest that relates what they want their character to do with some cool element of the game world. Then PCs figure out why they are working together and how their individual goals work into what their "group goal" is and why it's important to them. In this way I'm trading them plot hooks for character hooks.</li>\n<li><b>End of Session, before next:</b> Players build their characters - individual and group goals/motivations having been established first, instead of cobbled together after the fact. Meanwhile, I collect those individual and group goals and figure out they they relate to each other, and build some bad guys and their master plan that the characters will be emotionally invested against.</li>\n<li><b>Session Two:</b> Set up some exciting, Eberron-esque initial action scene to test the characters out and satisfy my own scene-setting desires. Tease them a little with some initial hints at the bad guys, and where they might find out more about them. Always have back-up options for conflict or dangerous locations, maybe even have more than one main option, constantly keeping the players on the spot and having to make choices.</li>\n<li><b>Following Sessions:</b> Keep comprehensive notes on the in-game plot developments, using them to brainstorm and alter the antagonistic events as needed. Rinse and Repeat. Begin planning a loose campaign arc that will contrast periods of exploration and PC goal resolution with horrible events, evil deeds, momentum-pushing deadlines and exciting climaxes. And so on.</li>\n</ul>\nAs convenient as it can be to "run off module"; I've noticed - especially with the crappy 4th edition ones we've got so far - that the pacing of the game tends to be all over the place. Obviously good GMing will naturally correct some of this (as would a well-written module) but I'm coming to more and more of the opinion that pacing is one of the most important factors that affects the fun of a session (well, once you kick out sucky behavior and encourage imagination), and more than that, the greater challenge of being able to control the pacing of a game seems to be something of a 4E design flaw.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been really pleased in my initial read-through of the 4eDMG2 (thumbs up so far, btw) that I think the designers realize this and that this is addressed a fair bit and there are some great tips to be had.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess if I'm worried about anything, it's that I'm actually pretty concerned about how to pace the sandbox game (both in individual sessions and in greater campaign arcs) because it seems like it would be so different than all the tricks I'm used to in, say, a module or story-arc based campaign. Since the "future" of the game is so open-ended - a Sandbox strength, to be sure - I feel like one might lack the confidence you get from knowing exactly what's coming around the bend and therefore you're not quite focused on what exact mood you want to set for what's going on currently. Does that make sense?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_232943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mordheim" title="mordheim"><img alt="mordheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.darkreign40k.com/drjoomla/images/comprofiler/tn62_47cea863027df.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mordheim">mordheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/232943/#Comment_232943" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-18T05:40:37+00:00" title="September 18, 2009  5:40AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is my impression that for a good sandbox game you need a very transparant rules system.

In other words, if the players' come up with focused characters that have an agenda, goal, whatever, then the players' will pace it for you. In this mode, the only way to break pacing is to have "nothing happen" If players go into town to  find out who has info on ytheir rival, "nothing happens" will kill pacing, but if they fins someone who knows a guy who has the plans to the local bank, then they faailed to find the info they wanted, but "something happened".<br/>\n2) Throw out Bangs or plot hooks when the PCs stall. But wait to see if they are rtruly stalled or just catching their breath. Then slam them with something they can't ignore (no nothing hapopens results). Even if they actively ignore your bang, that is at least somethign happening and good info for furture bangs/plot hooks/plot twists.<br/>\n  Hope that helps, good luck!<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233312/#Comment_233312" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T15:35:22+00:00" title="September 20, 2009  3:35PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2009 3:35PM by deadlytoque.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And don't be afraid of upsetting the cart!

So, to rephrase it: if your game is moving along at a good pace, and your players want to do something that might have major ramifications for the setting, let them! I think most of them would rather let something huge happen, and then have you end the session early so you can make adjustments to other ideas you may have had than to feel like there are "protected" elements in your sandbox.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kiznit" title="kiznit"><img alt="kiznit" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kiznit">kiznit</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233327/#Comment_233327" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T18:44:29+00:00" title="September 20, 2009  6:44PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2009 6:45PM by kiznit.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [blockquote][cite]Posted By: deadlytoque[/cite]And don't be afraid of upsetting the cart!

The published setting should really only exist as an outside source to the campaign at the beginning and from then on it's all us, baby.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact is, I guess I'm not truly looking for a full-on Sandbox type campaign in the traditional hexcrawl and random encounter table model. But I'm definitely trying to break out of the module-based or story-arc model we've been using.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>What I'm used to in the module/pre-planned story arc:</b><br/>\n[ulist]<br/>\n[*]Fully-fledged "bad guy" plans, pre-planned setpieces, leveling and xp matching to encounters.<br/>\nComfortable plot hook blatancy, solid DM-player communication as to what to do/where to go.<br/>\n[/ulist]<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>What I'm looking for from the Sandbox model:</b><br/>\n[ulist]<br/>\n[*]Forcing the players to define their character goals (and heck, their player goals too) before-hand and building the gameworld's antagonism off of that specifically.<br/>\nShroedinger's Gameworld: Elements of the world and goings-on not real until actually seeing play, subject to any and all brainstorming and change as things progress. GM joy from "seeing where things go", not just from being the puppetstrings-puller.<br/>\nTraining players to enrich their characters by pursuing their goals as opposed to bending those goals to fit the story.<br/>\n[/ulist]<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Things I'm worried about:</b><br/>\n[ulist]<br/>\n[*]Floundering. Players not used to being pro-active, being caught in a situation where nudging isn't enough.<br/>\nWhatever drag-and-drop encounters I've pre-tailored to player goals not working out for some reason.<br/>\nStory eventually going nowhere.[/ulist]<br/>\n<br/>\nMeh, having to write these out like that actually makes me feel like they're not too much to worry about. I'm pretty imaginative and so are my players, I think we'll probably do fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd still appreciate any and all tips from anyone that's been running more of the latter type of campaign and has become more comfortable with it, though. Everything that's been offered so far is really awesome and appreciated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
