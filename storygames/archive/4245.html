It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s usually about the relationship between the two guys, and the fishing provides opportunities for, as Josh so nicely puts it, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4240" rel="nofollow">externalization</a>.<br/><br/>In roleplaying games, on the other hand, games are often about what they\xe2\u20ac\u2122re about. D&amp;D is about whether or not you kill the monsters and take their stuff. Burning Empires is about whether or not you stop the Vaylen invasion. <br/><br/>However, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve found that enjoy a number of games when they\xe2\u20ac\u2122re played in the former mode, rather than the latter. My experience with <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4240&amp;page=1#Item_22" rel="nofollow">Polaris</a> demonstrates that. The Esoterrorists is another interesting case. By removing the uncertainty of whether or not the investigators can find the clues they need, the system makes it much more likely that I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll want to focus the game on the relationships between the investigators. (This my general approach to procedurals, by the way. Mysteries aren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t really about the mystery, as Dirty Secrets so nicely demonstrates.)<br/><br/>So when is a game about what it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s about? I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t really know. Anyone else have any experience like this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95214/#Comment_95214" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T13:53:13+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  1:53PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part of this depends on if you mean "game system" or "instance of a game" -- I don't just mean you Paul, but what anyone means by this.<br/><br/>I have to say that my more recent games mesh with your idea -- our Burning Empires game was on the surface about a prison world being infiltrated by the Vaylen, but was really about what it takes to get people to compromise on their beliefs and how their relationships change.  My last Unknown Armies game was on the surface about a group of folks saving the world while getting some revenge on folks who betrayed them, but ended up really being about how you treat the people you work with.<br/><br/>I think I'm unconsciously (until now) working this into my next UA game, about a group of related Godwalkers who reunite after a central loved one dies, on said loved one's farm.  On the surface, the conversations are about who gets the farm, but underneath it's really about who deserves to Ascend.  I don't know if this will work, but it's an idea I've been toying with.<br/><br/>But I'm not actually answering your question, because I'm not sure either.  Maybe with "game system", PTA is about what it's about -- playing in a TV show.  But then, is an individual game about what it's about?  I don't know, and maybe it's different for every game or story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95233/#Comment_95233" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T14:24:39+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  2:24PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Contenders, Contenders, Contenders.<br/><br/>Has anyone picked up the game because they liked boxing?

So I put what matters to me, Josh-the-player, into these slots.  Most of those things are thus immediately doomed.  No matter what I do, no matter how creative I am with narration or how clever I am in manipulating the rules, that doom will come to pass. They will die and will be forgotten.  This feels an awful lot like a sadistic bait-and-switch where the games says, "Here: care about something, and then I'll destroy it."  My disconnect is not with the setting; it's with the no-win proposition of the cosmos.<br/><br/>By contrast, while your FLFS thematic batteries will be repeatedly threatened and challenged, what happens to them is always and fundamentally up to you the player.  If I put "Noble Blood" on as a battery, anybody in the game can <em>say</em> that noble blood is worthless or irrelevant, but no one can <em>make</em> it worthless or irrelevant... except me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95279/#Comment_95279" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T16:32:54+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  4:32PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ptevis</cite>So to bring this back around, why the dislike for Polaris' "death and the end of the world" if that's just the backdrop against which you interact?</blockquote>\nTo me, Polaris isn't about that.  It's about being epic storytellers -- not telling epic stories, but actually being those storytellers.  That's another case where, from one player's perspective, Polaris isn't about what it's about.  But that doesn't have anything to do with your question to Josh.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Any particular game of FLFS is about the characters' thematic batteries and how they interact.</blockquote>\nThat almost sounds to..."sterile" might be the word I'm looking for...to feel like a satisfying answer.  Maybe too vague.  Or bringing mechanics into the discussion, making it sound boardgamey.  Somehow, I feel like FLFS isn't really about that.  But I have nothing more concrete than being arrogant enough to tell the designer that I found his answer about his own game to be unsatisfying. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95280/#Comment_95280" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T16:35:16+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  4:35PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>My disconnect is not with the setting; it's with the no-win proposition of the cosmos.</blockquote>\nIs that an issue with the tragedy-situation being pre-scripted, the tragedy-situation being about Everything, or the tragedy-situation in general?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95283/#Comment_95283" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T16:43:53+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  4:43PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2007 4:48PM by Josh Roby.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>My disconnect is not with the setting; it's with the no-win proposition of the cosmos.</blockquote>\nIs that an issue with the tragedy-situation being pre-scripted, the tragedy-situation being about Everything, or the tragedy-situation in general?<br/><br/>It's about it being absolute.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ptevis" title="ptevis"><img alt="ptevis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ptevis">ptevis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95289/#Comment_95289" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T17:06:44+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  5:06PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>My disconnect is not with the setting; it's with the no-win proposition of the cosmos.</blockquote>\nInteresting. In our game, our common Fate was "The Greatest Knight." So a lot of the story (and especially mine) focused on the question "What does the Greatest Knight do when...?" And we had a pretty good list: when the people turn against the Order, when his leadership is a detriment to the people, when love matters to him more than duty, when he learns of the fate that will befall all knights, etc. That we knew that we would die or become demons and that the city would eventually fall lent a poignancy to these questions. The things we truly cared about were not destroyed by the end of the world, because we did not let them be.<br/><br/>(Yeah, I'm a weirdo, because I think that Polaris can be a hopeful and affirming game.

I've seen it numberous times, and I know the star crossed lovers are doomed, but the story never ceases to be engaging. Its what tragedy is all about. I know this is a matter of taste, but I enjoy the dramatic irony. I know the world is doomed. The dawn will come and melt the snow, but my character struggles on. The game is about that struggle and I care how my character lives his last breath and ultimately falters. There are so many games about trying to destroy the ultimate evil and save the cosmos. Its nice to have one game where the cosmos is doomed and its about how you behave during the end of days.<br/><br/>Paul, in answer to your question, I think games are best when they are not about what they are about. Frex D&amp;D is best when its about being an fantastic adventurer on a fantastic adventure. When its about killing monsters and taking their stuff I tend to get bored. PTA may be about a TV show, but its really about the characters and the issues they bring to the table. And when Dogs is just about riding into town and deciding things (I think Jason Morningstar has used the term weak stakes), without provoking an inner dialogue within the player, I don't think its as good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95308/#Comment_95308" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-12T19:15:48+00:00" title="September 12, 2007  7:15PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 12, 2007 7:15PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>PTA may be about a TV show, but its really about the characters and the issues they bring to the table.</blockquote>\nThat's why I say that PTA might be an example of a game being about what it's about, at the system-level.

The complement is that some games are more easily and more frequently NOT about what they are about on the surface.  That's the key.  The surface layer and the things beneath.  Any game can be about the surface layer, and sometimes people will want it to be because that can be fun.  Any game can also have deeper layers about relationships or other themes.

I think I've been using it to mean "the outcome of the central endeavor is dramatically relevant to me." To get back to my improv example, the result of the fishing usually doesn't mean anything (and when it does, it's only because it's an externalization of the participants). In Polaris, the outcome of the central endeavor is fixed, so that's not something that I'm interested in exploring. Whereas in Burning Empires, the success or failure of the invasion is interesting to me.<br/><br/>I guess more what I mean is that in Polaris, the game is played against the backdrop of the end of the world. In Burning Empires, the invasion is in the foreground.

Looking at the Burning Wheel example... are the players going to change the fact that the game "involves" battling the Vaylen invasion? Not without changing the game, making it "involve" something else, playing an essentially different game. But will they fill the void that is the question that Luke asks about the consequences of the actions that people make in a setting that involves a Vaylen invasion? Yes, this is where the players get to be creative, what the game is "about." <br/>\n<br/>\nSo Paul's example with Essoterrorists is apt - it certainly involves investigations, but it's about how the characters handle themselves about each other while involved in such investigations (the mechanics eliminate play being "about" whether or not the investigation succeeds). D&amp;D is a bit more agnostic on this, because the setting is semi-ambiguous, and you can do a lot of things outside of killing and taking stuff without detaching from the mechanics altogether. So most D&amp;D games are going to involve killing things and taking their stuff, and also be about how well the players do that. But it's easier to take D&amp;D to some other place than it would be to, say, make a diplomacy game out of Essoterrorists, or to play a traveller campaign with Burning Empires. <br/>\n<br/>\nSome would say that's a strength of D&amp;D, some would say that's a weakness, but that's all just preference for system specificity. In any case, D&amp;D is more involved with, and "about" killing things and taking their stuff than, say, GURPs is about or involves anything in particular. So it's a spectrum. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95403">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95403/#Comment_95403" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T07:56:12+00:00" title="September 13, 2007  7:56AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Look for the reward mechanism.

For one reason that means that D&amp;D will always be ABOUT killing things because killing this is rewarded.  And I don't believe this to be true, though hell if I can come up with a really good counter argument right now.  Plus, if you're talking specifically about mechanical rewards I can think of many games which provide experience and other mechanical rewards more or less as a lump sum at the end of every session or "chapter" or whatever.  Most White Wolf games do this, I believe REIGN does this, as does UA...  so nothing specific is being rewarded by the mechanical treats of XP.  So what would those games be about?

For one thing, a lot of games have messy, contradictory, and highly drift-y reward mechanisms. For another thing, it's been traditional to override a lot of mechanical reward mechanisms with social ones.<br/><br/>I'd say that that's actually more or less correct - the main reward in D&amp;D is getting to change your character sheet to be more powerful. Leveling up, getting loot, filling in the map of the dungeon. Mastery stuff.<br/><br/>In "gradual improvement" games like WW, it's less about increasing <i>effectiveness</i> by changing the character sheet, and more about aligning the character sheet with your vision of the character. The reward for playing your character is that your get to play your character more. But games with that highly incremental style of mechanical reward often end up being more about some socially driven reward than the mechanical one.<br/><br/>I think the way a game gets to <i>be</i> About Something in the Capital Letters way is by having a strong, identifiable, accessible reward system. Many "traditional" designs really don't <i>want</i> to be About Something - they intend to have that filled in by the play group through social reward. That's one reason they tend to have fairly weak or noisy reward mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95496/#Comment_95496" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T11:44:59+00:00" title="September 13, 2007 11:44AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, the B/X D&amp;D seemed more about stealing stuff than killing stuff.

I'm finding that I enjoy games where character improvement is either non-existent or handled by the system in some other way -- and with the latter, I prefer that characters "change" rather than "improve".<br/><br/>Take for example, oh, Polaris -- we haven't mentioned that game in this thread yet.  Your character changes as the game plays because you can gain or remove aspects &amp; people in your cosmos.  And the process of progressing &amp; gaining experience isn't "my character is getting more awesome because I have more points to spend!" but is "my character is changing."<br/><br/>But, yeah, games with character improvement currency as a reward system can slide into being about that reward system, even if the game is also truly about something else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95588/#Comment_95588" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-13T14:33:57+00:00" title="September 13, 2007  2:33PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm, I see your point, Ryan, and I don't mind games that don't offer improvement for certain things.

You see a dragon tell me how you killed it. OK, on your way back you...

I think Burning Empires was the first game that revealed this to me clearly. In Principia, I consciously put layers between play and what the game is about. Principia is about resolving abstract questions. But the things you do in play are not abstract. They're about <i>this</i> interest, <i>this</i> relationship, <i>this</i> conflict. But everything you do when you're dealing with these particularities has an impact on the questions. Eventually there comes a point where mechanically you answer the question and narrate what it means for the game world.<br/><br/>So I guess my answer is that in Principia, it's during chapter-ending narration.<br/><br/>In general, I think a game tends to be about whatever the players can't resolve directly. In D&amp;D, they can't just level up. They have to <i>do</i> something to level up. This probably means killing goblins, and maybe carrying out some kind of mission or quest. So the game is sort of about that quest and sort of about becoming mightier. In Burning Empires, it's resolving the Vaylen threat but just as much about everything that earns you artha. In Contenders it's your dreams and hope and what happens to them when you try to become the champ. These just happen to tend to be the kind of stuff that lukzu spoke about.<br/><br/>Does that answer your question at all, Paul?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95863/#Comment_95863" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T08:02:32+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  8:02AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>When I have played PTA (twice) I rarely thought about it being a show after the initial pitch session.
