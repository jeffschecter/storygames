                    As a hobby, roleplayers seem tired of mindless ultraviolence. We want John Woo violence, violence that has consequences. Violence, when appropriate, could even gain bonuses. Sociopaths could gain bonuses, but they may be the same people who get bum rushed by a crowd because they are all Ã¢â‚¬Å“Richard RubenÃ¢â‚¬Â. The fact that people may disallow or disable combatants when the social mores do not allow for some type of violence is an important consideration. In the Victorian era, this was epitomized in the officerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s code; in chivalrous times it was similarly defined. In fact, the argument could be made that ever since there was the idea of martial combat there have been social mores that either allowed or disallowed different kinds of violence. This ties directly to the idea of social violence. This secondary conflict resolution system needs to be in Heisenberg.<br/><br/>Combat cannot occur unless the combatants first pass an environmental test and a social test. This accomplishes two things. First, it creates a social reinforcement structure that resembles modern society. Second, it discourages the boneheaded ultraviolence that the grognards seem to find so engaging.<br/><br/>An example of combat would start with a player who wants to inflict violence on another. This may include social violence, but that will come later. The environment will have a direct effect on the first test. It will be much easier to get in a fight in a bar or a dockyard than it will to be in a public square or a street. In some places, such as a funeral or a political fundraiser, it may be almost impossible to engage in combat. Once the environmental test is completed, the instigator must exercise a demeanor . The demeanor is a mental test that allows the instigator to initiate violence. Once both of those tests are completed the combat proceeds as in any other game. The violence may spill over into inappropriate locales or social situations that may cause new tests for environment or demeanor.<br/><br/>These may not be individual tests in the sense that they are discrete die rolls; they may instead be simply modifiers to other rolls. It is also possible that in some situations the environmental or social tests would not be necessary Ã¢â‚¬â€œ on a battlefield, or other areas designed for violence.<br/><br/>The consequences of these actions will be two-fold. One, it will prevent the overzealous violence that is the first response in many games. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I open the door, I see the baby in the manger, I kill it.Ã¢â‚¬Â Even though this is a vast oversimplification of the problem, the fact that physical conflict is so clearly defined in comparison to every other thing in roleplaying games makes violence the primary conflict resolution method. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy. By forcing the players and GMs to go through the mental process of creating violence, we may address that issue. Secondly, we can add a conflict resolution system for non-physical confrontation.                </div>

                            All people who play sociopaths are dysfunctional players? You can't conscientiously play a sociopath to explore that? The only worthwhile consequence is to jail such characters? <br/>
<br/>
What about characters who are simply violent at times...like soldiers? This isn't about preventing people from being violent, but simply about giving a mechanical social context to the choice to be violent. No different than another game having, say, mechanical consequences for doing something magical, say. <br/>
<br/>
Is it neccessary. No. But it might be interesting. <br/>

                            What Mike said ... plus, jailing the character would not end my interest in them.  That sounds like just the sort of consequences that would underline the importance of the violence.<br/>

<br>
Putting aside the weird generalisations, you're saying, "In order to remove this from being a default solution, I will make it more challenging and complex."<br>
<br>
That's a non-solution; it makes it a _magnet_ for attention.<br>
<br>
I suggest that you examine, for instance, HeroQuest, or any other game with a generalised conflict-resolution system. There's no need to deter violence systemically, because it's obviously not the only reliable solution, and it carries significant consequences that other solutions don't.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I hear what you are saying. The issue is that no one uses the alternate solutions presented (very much) and they do not become copied and widely popular mechanics because the community is not as interested in them. So, assuming they will use violence and then forcing them through a process that requires thought throough a specific set of decisions may address some shortcomings elsewhere.<br><br>At least that is my hope.                        </br></br></div>

<i>The issue is that no one uses the alternate solutions presented (very much) and they do not become copied and widely popular mechanics because the community is not as interested in them</i><br/><br/>Don't mistake cause and effect here.  Historically people haven't had much of alternate solutions, especially in the face of a) mechanics that don't support them and b) GM Fiat stomping all over alternate options in order to protect an Illusionist plotline.  That doesn't mean that people don't like it, just that they haven't seen a system + style of play that does support something other than violence.   Consider for a moment that even Exalted 2E has just added social conflict rules to it's set of options.                        </div>

Maybe you should put away this notion of universality, and talk about how this applies to you and the people you play with.                        </div>

                            Ditto Bankuei. I've played through whole seasons of PTA with "mainstream" gamers where violent conflict never emerged at any time, because the characters and their situation were simply not predisposed to violence.<br/>
<br/>
I'd be way more interested in your mechanics, Ross, as a basis for a game that deliberately emphasized violent conflict, as opposed to a system fix for gamer baggage. A soldier once told me that you can train all you want, but you never really know how you'll handle combat until you know the bullets are real. I personally know people who have run when their best friends, wives, kin, and so on have been jumped or threatened on the street, despite previous claims that they'd behave exactly to the contrary.<br/>
<br/>
Make a game that shows me even fragments of this in stark, terrible, revelatory detail, and I think you'll communicate a whole lot more that way.                        </div>

<br/>
It's an interesting take, but...what the hell? Violence is fun, it's compelling, sometimes with consequences, sometimes without. Turn on most television shows, go to any blockbustermovie, pick up any best-selling book.                        </div>

                            I've been playing a game involving lots of interviews, puzzling and mental exercises. Last night I presented my players with an opponent ready to do them harm. They grabbed guns they hadn't touched in weeks and threw spells they said they would only use as a last resort before their opponent armed himself. They hit him, hard, when he tried to disarm the gun toting player character. He fell to the ground beaten and unconcious. <br/><br/>After the dust settled I asked them to check their morality stats. One player failed and whined for hours about how when someone's life is threatened, they should respond with violence and expect no repurcussions. I countered that using your last resort spell to incapacitate a man whose weapon was already taken away was stressful enough to damage a person's response to violence.<br/><br/>If the checks were made before the attacks, would this have played out differently? I don't know. I doubt it. One of the players made it expressly clear his gun was loaded before they even entered the house.<br/><br/>There are games in which morality is discarded and violence is a goal. I'm writing one of them. <br/><br/>To make myself feel better about discarding morality, I'm also writing one in which players will be forced by the government to beat, arrest, interrogate and possibly execute their friends, neighbors and family. There is no morality mechanic, but anyone who doesn't have nightmares after playing this game is my definition of a dangerous person.                        </div>

                            I like the ideas behind the original mechanic, actually. To me, it seems more like a homebrew rule for Storyteller or Shadowrun and the like, where the GM is getting a little tired of the characters' otherwise non-reflective violent behavior.  Such a mechanic, if accepted by the group, makes "shooting the dude in the face in the club" a little harder to do than to talk them down.  Not a bad idea in my book.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of importing this mechanic a bit, maybe, for a TSOY game I'm running. I'm tired of players starting the conflict with the stakes "I kill them" (cause there's not many places you can go from there once that button is pressed). In most cases, I just tell the players that and they're like, "Oh, shit, yuo're right. Yeah, actually all I really want to do is knock him out/disarm him anyway". So it's all good. But giving these mechanical options a run might be interesting as well, as long as they remain uncomplicated and there's a kill-switch for "War" or "Hated Enemy" (like, in War you can always go to killing, and in other situations you can spend one XP/Drama Point/Hooyah to not have to roll for Violence against one enemy).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            JD, the issue the OP is confronting is that violence without consequence is the default in a lot of games, and there aren't sufficient alternatives.<br/><br/>Fortunately, I disagree that there aren't sufficient alternatives. Dogs is a very violent game; even when the guns are safely in their holsters, you're the ones who can maybe help because you represent the threat of violence. And there are certainly interesting consequences. <br/><br/>Conversely, all methods of conflict resolution are exactly equal in Under the Bed: your efficacy equals the number of relevant Characteristics your Toy has. Violence comes up rarely Ã¢â‚¬â€ usually when the player has the Violent card, which is only one of 38. The consequences of Violent action, like any other, are beneficial to the Child in the short run. The real consequences are that the players all watch the Violent Toy become the dominant one (or watch them fail and be overtaken by whatever the Opposition was).<br/><br/>Shock: allows you, of course, to choose violent methods of Praxis. It's something that has to be agreed on by everyone though, and maybe you wanted a tense political thriller or, I dunno, everyone's beings of pure thought who can't do violence anyway. In one game, mere <i>threats</i> were one end of Praxis; the characters were all kind of cowards, as it turned out, so that was enough. Asimov certainly didn't feel that violence was necessary to a story, so Shock: doesn't either, though; use whatever methods you think will be interesting for the kind of story you want to tell.<br/><br/>Now, Ross, why are you even playing with people you don't like? Or is this an abstract problem?                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>Now, Ross, why are you even playing with people you don't like?</blockquote>
Dude, way to push buttons. :-)<br/><br/>I admit, it sounds a little vague and disparaging of roleplayers in general from that first opening PP of the discussion, but getting down to the nitty-gritty of it, I'm sure it came simply from one too many face to face friend or con games where a player was like "I shoot him". "Dude, we're in a crowded subway car." "I don't care!"<br/><br/>Or: "I stab the king!" "You're in the middle of your trial, and there's nobles watching from everywhere." "I don't care!"<br/><br/>These kinds of rules are a little like enforcing the GM's view of how the world or how a scene should be. As a simple scene modifier for an existing game, i don't see a problem with it.<br/><br/>"If I tried to climb this wall, what would the difficulty be?"  "Hmmm.  I give it a 25."<br/><br/>"If I tried to shoot this Ventrue in the crowded club, what would the environmental/social difficulties be?" "Hmmm. Environmental 30, Social 15, and I'm only lowering it that much because he's your personal enemy."<br/>(and with Andy's mod)<br/>"OK. Well, I'm gonna spend a Willpower point anyway and bypass the Environmental check. Full auto, bitchez!"<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Oh, geez, I totally misunderstood Ross' intent (except that it still sounds like he's playing with lamers).<br/><br/>OK, dig, making a check without followup isn't a very good way to do it, I don't think; it's something that prevents action. Like, if you fail the check, you don't get to to stuff because your character's moral sense suddenly kicks in? Lame.<br/><br/>Let's try this instead: if you make the check, you do what you like and clear the consequences. Everyone flips out, but no one remembers your face or whatever. If you fail, you hesitate. The GM makes up a consequence (because this comes down to fiat, once again) that will happen if the player goes forward. If the player decides to go forward instead of heeding the warning ("a crowd of people will jump on you and beat the shit out of you!"), that thing happens. Dealing with that thing violently requires another check with consequence warning...<br/><br/>As an aside, I find GM fiat to be a totally distasteful technique, so this feels like arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic to me.                        </div>

                            I hear you, and here is a bit more about where I come from thematically.<br/><br/>I have been playing for almost thirty years. When we started it was D&amp;D, Tactics II, and micro armor. The wargame aesthetic boxes many players who grew up with this resolution by violence meme, and overcoming it is a herculean task after that kind of indoctrination. In many ways maybe I am playing with lamers, hell, maybe even I am lame. Still in 90% of the games we read about on RPG.net and elsewhere this is the modus.<br/><br/>I also realize that by approaching this from a very 80's viewpoint, trying to build a systemic solution -- but to bypass social reinforcement, which is something I see as a failed experiment, I can't think of many other options.                        </div>

                            Oh, no, wait, what I'm saying is, the kind of system you're talking about is designed to solve things through violence. Just don't start from there. Start with a system that has a unified CR mechanic and people will start coming up with all sorts of ways to do stuff.<br/><br/>The Shadow of Yesterday allows the use of any arena of conflict to Bring Down the Pain, if I recall (correct me if I'm wrong, Clinton). So you can "kill" a guy by shaming him in front of his peers, sticking him in the eye with an ice pick, beating him in a duel of riddles, whatever. Have a shill player who wants to play the jester with the razor wit and watch the dawn on the others' faces as he topples kingdoms and defeats evil.                        </div>

                            The game D4-D4 has a concept of will to kill, that's not what it's called but it gets the idea.  In order to pull the trigger on someone, you need to be willing to do so and how willing you are to do something like that is a trait like any other in the game.<br>
<br>
By contrast, Unknown Armies lets you pull the trigger at any time, but has you make a violence self-check which may lead to psychological fallout.<br/>
<br/>
And speaking of fallout, if you escalate to violence in Dogs in the Vineyard fallout is a very real possibility, and so resorting to violence may well lead to permanent changes in character traits.<br/>
<br/>
So this isn't a new concept, that's not knocking it, merely noting that there are places worth looking at to see how it's been done elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
One bit I don't grasp though is the environmental test.  If I want to attack someone, I have a psychological burden to overcome.  I can see that certain settings might make that hurdle higher, I don't really see though how they form a separate test.  How do you see that working?<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend if you try this combining it into one roll, otherwise you have an additional two stages to a combat which could make it a touch cumbersome.  Also, is this a metamechanic to be added to any game or part of an actual piece of game design?                        </br></br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Shreyas Sampat</cite>I suggest that you examine, for instance, HeroQuest, or any other game with a generalised conflict-resolution system. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no need to deter violence systemically, because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s obviously not the only reliable solution, and it carries significant consequences that other solutions donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t.</blockquote>
I think this is also worth looking at, when I ran HeroQuest one of my normally more violent players got engaged in an attempt by his character to tell an entertaining story in front of the city's governor.  A member of the audience, ill disposed to the character, tried to heckle and disrupt so as to make the story fail and embarass the character.<br/><br/>It was the big conflict of the night, it went back and forth and when eventually the character triumphed the emotional impact for us as players was as great as any combat, he had struggled, that had been mechanically modelled and thus had its outcome rendered partly randomised, he had won over an enemy.<br/><br/>Now, the interesting bit is that mechanically it was identical to a combat, and as satisfying for those who like that crunch, but it involved a social conflict.<br/><br/>Similarly Dying Earth and Duels of Wits in BW get to the same place, filling the tension and drama that a combat dice off (which is what most combats come down to in the end, albeit with tactics to affect the dice and modifiers) produces but with a non-violent conflict instead.<br/><br/>Sometimes players resort to violence because it's mechanically supported and so easier, sometimes they do so because the tactical dice off is fun, deal with those issues and violence won't go away but it might be less of a default option.                        </div>
