Steve Segedy stepped up and ran the numbers - if you are interested in how many people played (a lot) or what got played (a lot), <a href="http://www.indiegamesexplosion.org/2011/08/08/2011-games-on-demand-after-action-report/" rel="nofollow">check this out</a>. I ran four sessions of Dungeon World and maybe eight of Fiasco. I brought other games to run but they were relegated to after-hours play. At GoD I played with a ton of interesting people from all over the gamer spectrum. Almost all the games went very well and none were complete disasters.<br/><br/>I ran two sessions of Apocalypse World, each a genuine pleasure. The second was the best I have ever been involved with. I also ran a session Paul Riddle and John Harper's AW hack, <a href="http://seannittner.livejournal.com/131309.html" rel="nofollow">The Regiment</a>, which is a much friendlier pick-up game. I basically grabbed Rich Rogers halfway through and enlisted him as Private Macklin without skipping a beat. Durance, my Game Chef game, got a run-through, and I played Remember Tomorrow and Bulldogs. There was a lot of gaming going on for me.<br/><br/>Interesting stuff I ended up buying - J.R. Blackwell's game <a href="http://galileogames.com/shelter-in-place/" rel="nofollow">Shelter in Place</a>, Transneptune's <a href="http://games.transneptune.net/games/becoming-heroes/" rel="nofollow">Becoming Heroes</a>, Outrider's <a href="http://www.remnantsrpg.com/" rel="nofollow">Remnants</a>, and <a href="http://www.indieboardsandcards.com/resistance.php" rel="nofollow">The Resistance</a>, which I've played a lot already and is very solid fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337708/#Comment_337708" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-08T20:20:59+00:00" title="August  8, 2011  8:20PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We did a ton of games at Games on Demand.

I'd love to hear about your experience if you were there, including thoughts and suggestions for next year.)<br/><br/>I ran a bunch of <i>Fiasco</i>, one session of <i>Dungeon World</i>, and played <i>Technoir</i>, <i>Dresden Files</i>, <i>Be Ashamed Young Prince</i>, and <i>Love in the Time of Sei\xf0</i>. I wish I'd played some <i>Bulldogs!</i> and <i>Do</i> but never got the chance. After hours I got into a fun game of <i>Poison'd</i> and Jason's game of <i>The Regiment</i>, both full of excellent people.<br/><br/>I went to dinner at India Garden with a host of fun characters and great food and some really nerdy discussion. As I recall there was even gaming at the table, with Sage and Adam breaking out <i>Lost Worlds</i>. <br/><br/>I also got to spend some happy time with friends from Evil Hat and Margaret Weis Productions, celebrating the recognition for all their hard work.

I feel I may have overcommitted myself. Even had I stumbled upon GoD earlier than Sunday, I'm not sure I would've had much time to play anything. I just felt like I was always either super-busy or dead tired. No middle ground!<br/><br/>I ran four games: two of The One Ring, and two of FATE Kerberos. The former were fun, but plagued by our marginal (at best) understanding of the rules. The latter two were also fun, especially the second session, which finally went as I'd always wanted that particular scenario to go. <br/><br/>I played three games: A Dirty World, FATE Kerberos, and Wu Xing. I regret that last one. I was curious about the system, but it wasn't anything to write home about (IMO), and most of the players were just being male chauvinists to a juvenile extreme. I was pretty tired, though, so I was half-asleep through a lot of it.<br/><br/>Got to experience having a book released at GenCon! That was cool. Signed a few copies. That will never cease to be a novelty to me. Met some people I'd worked with online but had never seen in person before. Didn't get nearly enough time to visit with anybody.<br/><br/>Came home today with a ton of free product from Arc Dream and Cubicle 7.

I think partly because over at the Pelgrane stand with the new people on board, there were always enough around that you could chat to someone. We had a real posse. It was great to catch up with the people I only see once a year, if only for a few minutes (and a shame that the West Mass Massive weren't well represented. They seem to have moved on to different pastures). <br/><br/>I didn't only run the short demos but managed to run three longer games just by improvising from Paula's book. I was very pleased about that. The demos are fun, even though I've run the same one 55 times I still get a kick about introducing the game to new people, but the longer games are so much more involved and are a real opportunity for people to be creative, and they were.<br/><br/>I played something new and interesting which I can't talk about.<br/><br/>Games on Demand was wonderful. I sent a few people over there who were just not aware it was happening. This was always the best place to hang out at UK Gen Con, when we still had one, and the vibe there was very positive. Real kudos for Steve and everyone who pitched in. I'm not sure it could handle many more people in that room but it could certainly do with a bigger entry in the programme.<br/><br/>Gen Con was actually too short for me this year. I could have spent at least another day catching up with people and gaming.

From Gen Con 2011. I had Rich Rogers as the best wingman anyone can ever hope for in a podcast, but outside of recording/uploading sessions, I kept on the TJI mission and presence in and out of the hall. It was exhilarating and exhausting, and it meant I did a lot but didn't do much.<br/><br/>Exploring the new Exhibitors Hall was great; new space meant new transit patterns, so it was like seeing it anew for the first time. Getting assured chatting time with so many awesome guests on the show was pretty neat. How many people can claim they had Peter Adkison, Will Hindmarch, Daniel Solis, JR Blackwell, Ken Hite, Fred Hicks, Cam Banks, Eddy Webb, Wolfgang Baur, and Cthulhu (among many others) all for themselves for 15 minutes without any interruptions? I am, after all, just another fanboy. Also, Martian Dice was fun, easy to learn and quick to play. It's never leaving my backpack again.<br/><br/>I managed to make it to Games on Demand on Sat, but arrived after the slots had started, so I ended up running Lady Blackbird for Mick Bradley, David Moore, Chris Perrin and Clark and Amanda Valentine. We had a wonderful game of Steampunk Jane Austen. I also played in JR Blackwell's Shelter in Place, which was tons of fun. Also playtested a Battletech deckbuilding game that, while it needs tweaking, was incredibly cool!<br/><br/>I came back with very little, actually. Martian Dice (Tasty Minstrel), Nightfall (AEG), Ren Faire (Atlas), Dragon Brigade: Opening Salvo (MWP), and Cthulhu 101 (AOP, signed by Ken).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338209/#Comment_338209" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T08:20:51+00:00" title="August 11, 2011  8:20AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I spent most of the con showing off EpicTable, but I met some new friends, reconnected with some old ones, and got to shake hands with a lot of people I've known online for years.

The most frequent was Dick's Bodacious BBQ, where we ate three times.<br/><br/>I played Cthulhu Dark, Poison'd, Hit a Dude, and almost played Fiasco -- all the players were bloodied and bruised by Sagefight.<br/><br/>I was surprised that I didn't buy as much as I expected. I came home with Dungeon World, BW Gold and Adventure Burner. A Miskatonic U t-shirt for myself and that Doctor Who venn diagram shirt for Sarah. Some Doctor Who soap. I bought an oversized set of yellow polyhedral dice for Parker so we can use them to work on his numbers, a little shimmery blue 12mm d6 to replace the one eaten during our Cthulhu Dark game, and a set each of black and ivory 12mm d6s like Nora's from her Fiasco kit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher" title="Marc_Majcher"><img alt="Marc_Majcher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher">Marc_Majcher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338299/#Comment_338299" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-11T14:34:18+00:00" title="August 11, 2011  2:34PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I managed to get in a good amount of gaming, both with old friends and new. Graham ran us some Poison'd at the Embassy, Jason pulled us into a Dungeon World game at GoD, jumped into one of Brennan's many games of Bulldogs there, and I managed to pull folks into and run games of Lady Blackbird, Love in the Time of Sei\xf0, Remember Tomorrow, and, of course, Fiasco. We also got a good bit of SageFighting in, as well as several rounds of my new favorite, <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/the-resistance" rel="nofollow">The Resistance</a>. Between games, much socializing and catching up and meeting new folks, including several very pleasant meals with groups of one or twelve, a fine time all around.<br/><br/>I also hit a bunch of dudes.

However the games I made it to were all awesome!  Finally got to play DRYH, Mouse Guard, and went to some great seminars put on by the Skeptical Gamers.  My only regret is not making it to Games on Demand (again) this year.  What I may have to do for next year is not sign up for any gaming events and pledge to spend most of the weekend at GoD to make up for the past couple of years that I haven't made it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_338690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338690/#Comment_338690" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-14T05:00:27+00:00" title="August 14, 2011  5:00AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/78465.html" rel="nofollow">link</a><br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Gen Con Indy was apparently a big success. An ICv2 report says that Gen Con Indy broke previous attendance records, with 36,733 attendees.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo see what was played, "Bloody Stupid Johnson" analyzed the schedule of games at Gen Con Indy 2011, and broke them down by system. For each, he had number of scheduled games, maximum number of players, and total hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nD&amp;D; (all editions): 436 games , 10469 max players<br/>\nPathfinder: 251 games, 3258 max players<br/>\nWorld of Darkness (LARP): 17 games, 2715 max players<br/>\nLegend of the Five Rings: 30 games, 1008 max players<br/>\nHERO games (various): 104 games, 769 max players<br/>\nShadowrun: 97 games, 718 max players<br/>\nCall of Cthulhu: 98 games, 657 max players<br/>\nStar Wars: 71 games, 442 max players<br/>\nSavage Worlds: 71 games, 442 max players<br/>\nGURPS: 18 games, 121 max players<br/>\nWorld of Darkness (tabletop): 17 games, 76 max players<br/>\nPalladium: 6 games, 47 max players<br/>\nIndie RPGs*: 55 games, 1216 players<br/>\n<br/>\nThe status for indie RPGs is hard to measure. I count 35 specific games of the recent indie RPG trend (Dresden Files, Dread, Don't Rest Your Head, FATE, Mouse Guard, etc.). However, there are 20 identical slots of "Games on Demand" for any "indie RPG" with maximum 48 players.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that there are no numbers for how many games got their maximum number of players or even how many ran at all. So this is more a measure of interested GMs than of players. Interesting point that I took out of it were the resurgence of HERO games, that World of Darkness has shifted almost entirely to LARP.</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_338925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/338925/#Comment_338925" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-15T13:39:44+00:00" title="August 15, 2011  1:39PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2011 1:41PM by soviet.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stumbled across this at ENworld, thought the OP might appreciate the heads-up:<br><br><a href="http://www.enworld.org/forum/general-rpg-discussion/310102-i-played-fiasco-gencon-awesome.html" rel="nofollow">I played Fiasco at GenCon and it was awesome!</a> </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
