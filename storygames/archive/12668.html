We played Lady Blackbird just last night, and the role-playing seemed..."forced"  Don't get me wrong, we had insane amounts of fun, but I think we might have had just as much fun even if there weren't roleplaying incentives.  Seems to me most of the players I know like to role-play, to the point where they'll do it even if the game doesn't support it or even works against it.  In Pathfinder our barbarian will charge at the monsters even though it's not a smart move, it's just his character - and now he'll take a couple full rounds of attacks and possibly die.  The cleric won't heal the druid's tiger because his cousin now likes the tiger more than him and he's jealous.  That feels to me like *real* roleplaying, really making the hard choice...and In A Wicked Age and Fiasco don't give you rewards for pursuing your goals, but people pursue their goals anyway in those games...<br/><br/>Another way of looking at it is from another semi-famous behaviorism experiment:  kids like to draw.  The experimental group of kids is given money for drawing. The next day, the control group is still drawing, but the experimental group stops because they're not getting paid.  <br/><br/>Yet another way of looking at it - Jesse Schell defined "play" as stuff you do that you don't have to do.  Once you incentivize something, you turn play into work.  Obviously there's a zillion World of Warcraft players out there who disagree, but that's why I personally don't play WoW (don't like doing chores) and I'm not sure how much I like bringing similar incentives into my real roleplaying.<br/><br/>SO:  What do you think?  Would you and your friends still roleplay (in the strict sense, play the way your characters would) if there were no incentives, and if so, why use incentives?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284440/#Comment_284440" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T11:26:42+00:00" title="August  5, 2010 11:26AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure!  The reason incentives are cool is because they can structure things.  Like, an artist might draw because they like drawing. But if I want a drawing of this particular thing, done by this particular day, I can pay the artist and get that.  You don't just randomly stumble around doing things, as fun as that is, but having strucutre really helps channel creativity.  That's not to say that lacking incentives, or saying "do what you want here" is a mistake, as you point out, it can result in some cool unexpected moments and arcs, it's just a different decision.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

But they're rules. What's going on with reward cycles is that you don't need to improvise the rules for that stuff all the time \u2014 you're getting the techniques that another player (the designer) has discovered work well.</p>\n<p>The point isn't that it necessarily works better for <em>everything</em>. The point is that it works best for that <em>specific</em> thing.</p>\n<p>So, like, In a Wicked Age gives you Best Interests, but no mechanical incentive, right? Nope! The mechanical incentive is that your Best Interests are known by the GM, and he's doing what he can to make their pursuit sticky and fun. That's the mechanic: tell the GM. The reward is getting (or failing to get) that which is in your best interest (and whether you still want it when you start to see what it costs). Without that back-and-forth, the game would be much flatter.</p>\n<p>(There are some problems with the way IaWA works, and one of them is making sure this link is concrete, so it's not the perfect example.)</p>\n<p>In Hot War, those things are almost your only resources; it reminds you to show everyone that this is the thing your character's about, and gives you opportunities to show stuff you might not have thought of otherwise: "Hm. I need more dice to get this guy to tell me where he lives. Oh! I'll bring in my 'Sacred Arts of Isis!' I go back to my flat and burn some incense along with a piece of paper with the guy's signature on it, then breathe the smoke."</p>\n<p>The point is the focus, not that you can't do it otherwise.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284447/#Comment_284447" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T11:36:57+00:00" title="August  5, 2010 11:36AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2010 11:49AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Constraints breed creativity, for sure. <br/><br/>As a player, if I choose Key of Bloodlust (or Aspect: Bloodthirsty Bastard), that helps orient me whenever I sit down to play. I know what I'm after because I picked it. When that gets boring I change it.<br/><br/>As a GM, seeing Key of Bloodlust (or Aspect: Bloodthirsty Bastard) on somebody's sheet tells me he wants to get in big, messy fights where he can kick ass. That is really useful to know. <br/><br/>We could have a long conversation about it before we begin the game, and that works too, but I'm bad at remembering.<br/><br/>Oh! You call out Fiasco as incentive-less, but that's not true. Like IAWA, the incentives are not strictly mechanical, but they are definitely there. What are the factors that govern a player's choice to establish or resolve? What are the factors that govern die color choice, individually or collectively?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284448/#Comment_284448" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T11:37:28+00:00" title="August  5, 2010 11:37AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey look!

They are super great. <br/><br/>I was playing D&amp;D 3rd edition, mostly, when I first learned about Keys (through the <a href="http://files.crngames.com/cc/sweet20/experience.html" rel="nofollow">Sweet20 system</a>, which is actually kind of unsatisfying after a while).<br/><br/>In D&amp;D, a good role-player decides what his guy is all about. My guy is the sneaky thief who's all about secrets, or my guy is the wizard-hunter who lives for cold, black revenge. And in a good D&amp;D game, everyone plays those roles, and that's fun. <br/><br/>But no matter how well you play that role, or how much it enriches the game, the system itself never rewards you. My guy is all about learning secrets, and I portray that wonderfully, but the only way the game itself rewards me (which I want, because I want my character to advance) is by killing monsters. The stuff about learning secrets, which is so important to my character concept, is completely divorced from the rules.<br/><br/>But when I have the same guy with the Key of Learning Secrets, I now get rewarded (which is what I want) for doing the very thing that is making the game fun in the first place.<br/><br/>To me, that is what makes these kinds of mechanics fun, and good, and worth using and emulating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284454/#Comment_284454" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T12:00:04+00:00" title="August  5, 2010 12:00PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2010 12:01PM by Jesse.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, here's my take.  Yes, me and my friends can role-play with each other if we want.  But I'm not at the table *just* to talk in funny voices and pretend to be a character and make stuff up.  I do that at work with my co-workers around the water cooler all the time.  Go pick up a copy of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon for the Wii and you'll see me credited as Jesse "Von Body" Burneko.  That's because my co-workers have built up a persona around me name Baron Von Body.  He apparently rules a country that exports tea and uses lions to keep his peons in line.  The story of Baron Von Body is quite long and epic actually.  All done with no rules just screwing around with each other.<br/><br/>So, I play RPGs to purposefully and directly engage *the game*.  Different rule sets offer different kinds of choices and foster different kinds of communication.  The points of "fiction" that a currency like FATE, Artha, and XP pass through are all different, all unique and all promote VERY different kinds of game play.  It's not *just* that I get a reward for RP what I can then DO with that reward is different across different games.  That fosters different points of focus for communication, a different flow of fictional events and different set of game-play choices to make.  I play to experience and engage those differences.  So yes, what is rewarded, how it's rewarded and what you can then channel those rewards into is vitally important to me as a player.<br/><br/>It's the very reason I own and play lots of different games, rather than just one sort of passable game that gets out of the way of me talking in funny voices, playing a character and making stuff up.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

There are market-driven players I can't connect with: every action must be incentivized, even to the point of breaking genre assumptions, agreed-to setting/situation, even the social contract to not be a dick to each other. There are also virtue-driven players I can't connect with: studiously hewing to their play goals even when the system actively punishes them, and sometimes others, for doing so.<br/><br/>There are also game systems I can't connect to for similar reasons, although I find myself liking the creative constraints and inputs generated by more market-driven games like BW, PDQ# and, to a lesser degree, Fate. I'd go so far as to say that any RPG that relies solely on virtuous play -- you play a certain way because playing a certain way is its own reward -- is more often not going to excite me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284487/#Comment_284487" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-05T13:44:31+00:00" title="August  5, 2010  1:44PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2010 1:45PM by Mcdaldno.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>Ok - so I totally see the value of having your Best Interests / Keys / Aspects / Beliefs / Goals written down.

(And I've tried to like them!)<br/><br/>Now, I like focus in some games. I just want the game to say "we do this in this game" instead of "hey, if you do this, I'll give you a carrot!" <br/><br/>(I designed Archipelago to work that way: At the start of the session, you pick a destiny for your character and play towards it. No points gained; it's just your focus for that session.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall" title="Kayfall"><img alt="Kayfall" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kayfall">Kayfall</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284575/#Comment_284575" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T05:03:43+00:00" title="August  6, 2010  5:03AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, in a number of games, the focus is primarily narrative, but there are still gamey things going on too. Roleplay in the story is the primary activity, but it's not freeform -- the rules inform the fiction, and the fiction informs the rules. <br/><br/>So one of the ways that the rules inform the fiction is when they give power to the players or take it away. In the beginning of a session of the Dresden Files, for instance, your powerful wizard may start out with fewer Fate points, which means that you need to get into trouble in order to earn more of them, building them up in order to succeed later. Once you have lots of Fate points, you can use them to gain a significant advantage toward the climax of the story. That sort of building tension more and more all the way up to a climax where it is released is a pattern of fiction, and the economy of aspects and Fate points helps recreate that in a satisfying way. <br/><br/>So from one perspective, the players are trying to do their best to succeed in a tactical sort of sense, building up points now so they can succeed later. But this same tactical choice leads to a satisfying narrative experience as well. The game design of currency is support to reinforce that sort of thing in different ways in different games. <br/><br/>Keys, as another example, reward you with experience for doing a simple thing, more for doing a dangerous thing, and a lot for making a big narrative change in your character -- the number of experience points you gain is simply a way of marking how fast your character is growing, whether it's a slow and steady buildup of growth, or a quick and speedy dash to excellence with lots of drastic changes along the way. In systems with keys, both of these are viable options and advancement is designed not to imbalance the system greatly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284576/#Comment_284576" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T05:16:42+00:00" title="August  6, 2010  5:16AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>Yeah, that is how we did it.

The paragraph quoted is really essential in this issue, so thank you for posting it!<br/><br/>I find keys interesting as a way of giving direction to players of my classical fantasy rpg. I've just started trying them out in the game, and are aware that they may place structure on something that may be better off without it.<br/><br/><i><b>Some background for what I say further down:</b><br/>I've had bucketfuls of great experiences with my fantasy game, and so have others. Some of the gameplay have been of a quality I've seen very seldom in more modern design. This has been done without any keys, aspects or beliefs. The players have been left to work out their character through intense and focused interaction, having their characters challenged on moral issues that leaves room for doubt about what is the right thing to do, and having them experience consequences that really highlight the gist of their choices.<br/><br/>And I've designed modern rpgs too, where the players have been thrown into the deep pool of life; trying to cope with matters of friendship, romance, matrimony, career, sickness, dying family, funerals and 'ghosts' (memories). This has been done with no other guidance for the players than a short biography of the character.No keys or aspects or beliefs were placed on the characters. And the game has still soared towards heaven, leaving the players with a sense of wonder over life, and a feeling that the game was a gift of insight, wisdom and love for your fellow man.<br/><br/>I've never even been close to such game-play in games with keys.</i><br/><br/>So ...<br/>- I find it quite pertinent to ask if <i>keys, aspects and beliefs</i> are a small ripple in the development of role-playing games. Are they really as great as many players say? Do they really cater for great role-playing? I'm not sure.<br/><br/>It may well be that the really great gameplay hinges on other techniques and tools, and that some of these techniques appear spontaneously in classical rpgs. In my view this may have to do with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the qualities of the setting-elements</span> we are playing with, how these elements connect to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the characters</span> given, and how <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the players</span> make use of these connections. It may not sound as sexy as <i>keys</i>, but it may well be that the road to the greater treasure lies thereabout ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284586/#Comment_284586" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T06:45:34+00:00" title="August  6, 2010  6:45AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>So, let's say everyone writes down things they like and things they think about their characters.

There's no reason another player's actions can't surprise and challenge me.  But something like the playsets in Fiasco and the oracles in In A Wicked Age, those push me to places I might not go otherwise -- not because I don't want to go there, but because I didn't even know those places existed.  Making a critical success or critical failure in a trad game -- especially when a character is particularly incompetent or competent, respectively -- throws me out of what I *expect* to happen and into what *might* happen.  Again, another player could say, "Well, he's so cocky, wouldn't it be character-defining if he failed miserably at that task?"  But that doesn't have the same feel .<br/><br/>My second answer is practical.  If we have a system of Flags, with mechanics on top of it, we can just play Flags if we're all feeling on the ball -- but if someone is having a low-energy or stupid day, the mechanics can help smooth it over and cover it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284658/#Comment_284658" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T12:19:37+00:00" title="August  6, 2010 12:19PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thinking about this more, I found another way of putting it, which I think just boils down the issue to Baker's "being there" vs "tell a story"...<br/><br/>Without artha / hero points / etc, the bloodthirsty barbarian's player has no incentive to play the barbarian bloodthirsty - which means the player is making the same hard choice the barbarian is.  (Or a similar choice, anyway;  losing your character isn't as big a deal as losing your life.)  The player is slightly more immersed, slightly more "is the barbarian."<br/><br/>With artha / hero poitns / etc, the player is incented differently from their character.  Probably better for "tell a story", because it's true I'm much less likely to do PvP or try to get, say, romantically involved with a character in the party unless the game pushes me.  But now I'm a bit less immersed, a bit less my character.  (Not to mention I'm doing more bookkeeping.)<br/><br/>So, yeah, matter of taste, and my taste will probably swing back and forth as I get tired of one mode and want to switch back to the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284659/#Comment_284659" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T12:28:50+00:00" title="August  6, 2010 12:28PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After testing some DINGUS (insert key/aspect/whatever here) mechanisms in Sot Horizon last night, one thing we found was that by paying players for bringing significant elements of their characters into the narrative, and paying with something they want -- need even -- we got great stories that were stories they had declared they wanted to tell.<br/><br/>Now some are saying, "if they wanted to tell that, why didn't they"?<br/><br/>The thing is, in play, we are not elves. We are guys sitting around a table talking and weaving stories. We are mostly, essentially, solving the fictional problems before us as ourselves. Sure, some get more or less into character, but the tendency for many (I will guess most) people is to let the character slide a little as we get really into the narrative because it's all work.<br/><br/>Last night, though, Bob made his character be a DRAGON. He did hardcore dragonny things, where before he was a dragon-shaped guy. So it really worked and worked hard. It was a constant reminder to look down at the character sheet and bring stuff up from it for play.<br/><br/>Now you could argue that these players suck and you should only play with people who always do that anyway. Fuck that, my players are awesome and any game mechanism that triples that is a mechanism that plays. And you want rules that facilitate, not rules that only work for people who are already awesome. You don't always get to play with Vince Baker or whoever else consistently makes great stories out of their brain and little else. And as a game designer, you want practically ANYONE who pays good money for your game to get an experience that you intended to deliver.

On top of that, if you want to play with a group of people with varying skill levels for RPing, then having mechanics that facilitates <i>Teh Awesome</i> from the worst players is fantastic. Really, in a ruleset aimed not at the <i>Best Players Evar</i>, having mechanics to remind them how to get the most out of their character and their stories should be the goal of game design. The manifesto should be <i>Games for the People</i>, not <i>Games Just for People Who Don't Need Rules To Bring It</i>. <br/><br/>It seems to me that both Aspects and Keys are aimed at this exact thing. In the land of do it yourself stories, saying that you can create memorable stories without Keys and Aspects and we will all likely just get over them is like saying that you can make your own bread with self milled flour from grain that you grew yourself, and someday we will only bake bread from our own ingredients. Buying flour at the store for making bread doesn't make it not homemade bread, and even master bakers still mostly use flour bought from the store. Expecting everyone to mill their own flour from grain that they grow themselves is unreasonable, and so is the idea that everyone should be able to roleplay <i>Teh Awesome</i> from scratch. Pre-milled flour, Aspects, and Keys just facilitate <i>Teh Awesome</i> without as much work. Sure it woule be nice to grow wome wheat, mill some flour, and then make some bread with it, but who has the time? Not most people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doug%20Bonar" title="Doug Bonar"><img alt="Doug Bonar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doug%20Bonar">Doug Bonar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284694/#Comment_284694" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T15:35:30+00:00" title="August  6, 2010  3:35PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just 'cause I liked the analogy.

If anyone is as competent as she wants to be, competence is a pretty shallow reward, for example. And if the players aren't powergamey in the least - they have no preference between playing a level 1 or a level 100 character - competence is again pretty empty as a reward.

It's incumbent on the GM in Fate to keep the pressure on so that the players need to tag aspects to get what they want, spending Fate. That makes compels necessary to refresh which brings in more complications. It's a great pacing mechanism, but if things don't feel challenging it takes the edge off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284831/#Comment_284831" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-08T10:51:49+00:00" title="August  8, 2010 10:51AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><cite>Posted By: Upstart</cite>But my mind doesn't work that way: in one particular TSoY campaign keys began to feel redundant when characters seemed to succeed in everything anyway.</blockquote>\nThat's self-limiting.

(Or a similar choice, anyway;  losing your character isn't as big a deal as losing your life.)  The player is slightly more immersed, slightly more "is the barbarian."<br/><br/>With artha / hero poitns / etc, the player is incented differently from their character.  Probably better for "tell a story", because it's true I'm much less likely to do PvP or try to get, say, romantically involved with a character in the party unless the game pushes me.  But now I'm a bit less immersed, a bit less my character.  (Not to mention I'm doing more bookkeeping.)<br/><br/>So, yeah, matter of taste, and my taste will probably swing back and forth as I get tired of one mode and want to switch back to the other.</blockquote>\nThere are plenty of story-focused RPGs that don't use anything like a Key mechanic: Dogs in the Vineyard, Lacuna, Don't Rest Your Head, etc.  Conversely, Keys are very similar to pay-as-you-go disads - starting with Characteristics in The Babylon Project - a 1997 licensed sci-fi RPG for the Babylon 5 series, which most would regard as very traditional.  Most TBP Characteristics are very similar to Keys - you pay for them, and you gain a fortune point when the Characteristic causes you difficulty.  For example, if you have the "Dependent" trait, you get fortune points if difficulties arise from your personal tie.  <br/><br/>So I don't think that Keys = "tell a story" versus No Keys = "being there."  A game like DitV can be very much "tell a story" without having Keys.  <br/><br/>I see Key-like mechanics as one hybrid between tactical play and cooperative imaginative play.  Some see it as a potential stepping-stone between them, though I'm not sure I would prefer it as that.  Note that tactical play is not a synonym for all traditional RPGs or "being there."  One can have a very immersive / "being there" game without being tactical.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Upstart</cite>One thing that I hope to see more discussion about are the actual rewards. If anyone is as competent as she wants to be, competence is a pretty shallow reward, for example. And if the players aren't powergamey in the least - they have no preference between playing a level 1 or a level 100 character - competence is again pretty empty as a reward. Basically I can think of two possible rewards: player (narrative) and character power. Maybe spotlight time too.<br/><br/>Of course you may say that rewards are rewards just because they are rewards: people don't care what the bennies actually do, they just know they're supposed to get them in the game. But my mind doesn't work that way: in one particular TSoY campaign keys began to feel redundant when characters seemed to succeed in everything anyway.</blockquote>\nUsing narrative power and spotlight time as rewards may not be desired, though.  Players tend to get rewards when in the spotlight - i.e. they get rewards for highlighting their character's problems, pursuing their character's goals, etc.  If you reward this with more spotlight time, then that is positive feedback where you give the spotlit players more spotlight time, which puts the other players more in the background.  I prefer a roughly even division of spotlight time - and if a player has not been shining, I try to look for ways to help them shine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

So, at first you will ask, then you will make eye contact and gesture and then you will just take it.  I like that, it leaves me to do other things and let's me concentrate on bringing it."</blockquote>\nOne of the really interesting things about player-prompted reward mechanisms is that each group develops social cues to ease this process along and alert the table that a player has taken XP for themselves.<br/><br/>One thing I tried with Lady Blackbird at a con was to put a buttload of chips in the middle of the table and early on cajole players into taking a chip, which represented an XP.  It not only took the work of assigning XP off my plate, it gave me a visual cue to who was getting the most XP.  I actually looked at the player for Snargle and said aloud, "You aren't getting to hit your keys much are you?" and framed the next conflict right in his FACE! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

A game like DitV can be very much "tell a story" without having Keys.</blockquote>\nSorry, I wasn't trying to say that it was a black-and-white thing, that you couldn't be immersed in a game with artha and vice-versa.<br/>I was just trying to say that artha/hero points/etc push you in the direction of telling a story, but also push you away from immersion.  Motion along the continuum.  Salt to taste.<br/>I'd agree that as an out-of-character mechanic, hero points push you away from immersion.  Similarly, using Keys/Aspects/Beliefs to gain XP pushes you away from immersion.  <br/><br/>However, most XP systems are out-of-character and run counter to immersion - excepting maybe Traveller and a handful of others.  A very old complaint about D&amp;D is the confusing part that killing monsters and collecting gold eventually helps you Read Languages.  Some players may find Keys/Aspects/Beliefs less intrusive on immersion than a D&amp;D-like XP mechanic, because they are tailored to the character, so just acting in-character gets you XP.  So Keys/Aspects/Beliefs may be more immersive than many alternatives, though less immersive than some.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Keys, aspects, beliefs, etc - are they really all that? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12668/keys-aspects-beliefs-etc-are-they-really-all-that/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Keys, aspects, beliefs, etc - are they really all that? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12668/keys-aspects-beliefs-etc-are-they-really-all-that/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Posted By: Joshua A.C.

Newman</cite>John, Traits in Dogs work much the way Keys do, though their benefit is more immediate. But you're right; "Tell a story" vs. "Being there" is not to be found in these mechanics. I mean, frickin'<em>Mechaton</em>has a reward cycle that's not so dissimilar, and it's a strategy game.And you're right: rewarding players with spotlight time doesn't make sense; spotlight time is how they should be able to gain rewards. This kind of inside-out design comes up all the time. You don't want to<em>limit</em>spotlight. You want to<em>apportion</em>it. You want to make<em>sure</em>everyone gets some.What Keys (Traits, Aspects, Links, &amp;c.) do is<em>close the feedback loop between fiction and mechanics</em>. They make it so stuff you do in the fiction is reflected in your record of the fiction, and they make it so, when you access the record of the fiction, it has an impact on the fiction itself.</blockquote>\nRegarding spotlight time...  <br/><br/>While there's nothing wrong with spotlight-based awards, I'm also interested in rewards that aren't based on being in the spotlight.  i.e. You earn awards not by showcasing your own character, but by supporting others.  Burning Wheel's "Workhorse" award is one of the few parallels I can think of - maybe there are others.  <br/><br/>As for the feedback loop...<br/><br/>It seems like you're saying that these mechanics just mean that when something is described verbally in the game, it may result in invoking a rule that changes something on the character sheet - like adding or removing from a set of points.  But as far as I can tell, that's true for a great many mechanics - it's not specific to Keys or even reward mechanics.  i.e. Many damage or harm mechanics convert from a description into some mechanical change on the character sheet.

I'm not saying that it's bad - just that for me it isn't of value for itself, only in what other stuff it enables.  Sometimes such connections to character stats work well, but other times not having a connection to character stats works well.  For example, 1001 Nights has a bunch of traits that have no mechanical connection at all - and I think that works very well for it.  <br/><br/>Also, I don't think agree about your examples.  Losing excess hit points is a one-way interaction, true, but so is invoking Keys.  I do something in the fiction, and as a result some rules are invoked and I change the number of points I have on the sheet.  Comparing: <br/><br/>1) An action is declared that would result in damage.  The rules are invoked, and based on the rule, I reduce my number of HP.  <br/><br/>2) An action is declared that would hit on a Key.  The rules are invoked, and based on the rule, I increase my number of XP.  <br/><br/>Keys have narratively more interesting content, but I don't think that they're different than hit points in terms of mechanics/fiction interaction.  <br/><br/>I think in most things, the vital part is in how the mechanics are implemented and explained, not in fundamental distinctions.  For example, the basic idea of getting XP for actions matching certain personality traits has many implementations - like Nature/Demeanor in White Wolf's Storyteller system and Characteristics in The Babylon Project.  What makes Keys distinctive is the specific implementation, not in the general idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

You're right. I was thinking about it as a none-way interaction, but you're absolutely correct. It crosses the fiction -&gt; record line the same way Keys do. It just doesn't cross back.</p>\n<p>Also, I misspelled "write" as "right", so obviously, um, not my best post ever.</p>\n<p>In any event, I'm not saying that mechanics that don't cross that line are inherently bad. I'm just saying that the results are flatter than when they do, and rules that don't cross that line have a head start on being bad on the grounds that they will likely wind up being <em>irrelevant</em>. But here, lemme restate the non-obvious example that I gave above:</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>E.g. "you can only kill someone if you have 'murderous' written down, and you can only write down 'murderous' if you first have 'desperate'".</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>When you change "Desperate" to "Murderous", it doesn't necessarily get reflected in the fiction. Maybe I see a look of grim resolve come over your character's face or whatever, but not necessarily. And maybe I can change "Desperate" to "Murderous" any time I like! Maybe I do it because I <em>someone</em> has to be murderous right now and I don't mind my character getting caught underprepared, not because there's a fictional reason. But let's say that the character can only become "Desperate" when there's only one character left on the "People I Love" list, and the others have been murdered.</p>\n<p>So now we have a fictional input (murder of the characters that your character loves) \u2014 to a record (crossing them off your sheet) \u2014\xa0to a record (becoming Desperate) \u2014\xa0to a record (becoming Murderous) \u2014 to fiction (your character murdering someone).</p>\n<p>It's probably sub-optimal. Shock: has a weird thing like this, in fact, that I'd love to be able to make better.

This turns a reward into an emphasis - you really notice when a character does thing X, as that event is framed and spotlighted by the act of grabbing for XP.</li>\n<li>XP is given on the basis of fictional events only, not for "good roleplaying" or other behavioristic, GM-adjudicated reasons. Not that the GM doesn't adjudicate Keys (he does, although in a functional group it's not a big deal), but the fact that Keys only ping on the fiction draws attention away from proper vs. improper play and success vs. failure and into the fiction and whether something happens therein or not. Specifically, instead of getting XP for doing the right thing you get XP for doing <i>anything</i> as long as it's relevant to the subject matter (Key, that is) at hand.</li>\n<li>XP is used to transform your character's identity, not to merely increase the numbers on the character sheet. Instead of having a static character you're making "more like himself" by adding things he should have, you have a dynamic character you discover through play. Instead of playing towards the ideal state of finally having the privilege to play the character you wanted to play to begin with you begin play with that character and find out what happens next.</li>\n<li>The rate of XP gain is a personal choice intersected by group dynamics. The purpose of the game is not to gain XP as fast as possible (D&amp;D), and the purpose of XP is not to be a token bone thrown to keep the players happy (Whitewolf), either. It's largely up to the player to decide how quickly his character gains experience points and spends them, and therefore how quickly his identity develops towards its final state and Transcendence.</li>\n</ul>\nYou'll note that most of those are not that attached to the superficial mechanics of Keys; what makes Keys different from traditional xp mechanics is more about what they're used for than how they work. I agree with you in that if you remove the immediacy of the XP reward and turn all the things XP can be spent on into variant kewl powers, then the TSoY experience set-up does not differ a lot from Auspices. Likewise if you remove the function of character development pacing, then there's not much different from Exalted Stunts. Equivalently, I don't find the player-defined Keys the most important thing about the TSoY experience mechanics; why you collect the XP is much more important, and TSoY does a good job on making the XP matter as a pacing device for character development instead of a "reward" (an empty concept altogether, to reward players with mechanical points).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286373/#Comment_286373" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T00:53:10+00:00" title="August 15, 2010 12:53AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2010 1:00AM by masqueradeball.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you give me an example of how they are a pacing device?

The most that can be said for TSoY in this regard is that it's more coherent as a text regarding the purpose and technique of its XP system; it's easy to say that "we played Rolemaster in 1992 and it was just like that", but that just means that your local application of the game was like this. With TSoY (and several earlier games, such as Heroquest) these techniques are not merely local applications and preferences of individual GMs, but the way the game text has been written.<br/><br/>The TSoY XP system is a pacing device because it tells you when your character changes. To become a master of Zu your character needs an Advance, which equals (usually) five experience points. When your barbaric character washes from a shipwreck to a Zaru village and lives with the locals, coming to appreciate their way of life, the XP system tells you when and how the character can integrate aspects of the culture to himself. And when he leaves the gentle yet naive Zaru behind, we can look at the character sheet and see what impact this episode in the hero's life had on him. The XP system very concretely paces these changes in character, as the system tells you when you have earned the privilege of making permanent changes to the character; you the player can't just decide that now my character will learn the secrets of Zaru culture, but rather the system tells you when you've earned the right to this interesting new character identity as a half-Zaru. The overall character development system also provides a framework for the end-point of this development, the Transcendence, which is where the character's story ends.<br/><br/>Now, most any game's XP system can be interpreted as a pacing device and as a system of developing character identity. After all, in most games you specifically do get XP at some rate that limits your character development, and it can also be said that this character development defines and refines the character's identity. What is different in TSoY is that the pacing of character development is much more flexible and controlled - it's all about goals you set yourself, and the speed of XP gain can shift dramatically compared to most games - and of course the XP is specifically gained by dramatic development instead of facing challenges, which ties the XP gain into the XP spend as your character gets provoked to spend XP in the process of gaining XP. What is also different is that the "character crunch" or "kewl powerz" in TSoY are specifically and intentionally created to be tools of expressing and defining character identity instead of tactical tools of bad-assery like character development options are in almost all traditional games. The difference is subtle, but it's real: when we define and describe a character identity framework such as a culture or occupation in TSoY, the description strives to pinpoint the ways in which this character identity is different and interesting instead of trying to give a balanced yet exciting set of ass-kicking options like is more typical of traditional design. Specifically, TSoY avoids dramatically empty crunch; generally speaking all crunch strives to mean something about your character in the fiction instead of just being another +2 to brawling.<br/><br/>What the above ultimately means is that in TSoY your character learns the magical language of Zu foremost because he is given the opportunity and he appreciates the culture that comes along with the skill, rather than because the player read about Zu from the rulebook and wants to add this facet to his character. A pretty good comparison in this regard are D&amp;D spells, which are almost completely culturally neutral in the game's setting: a wizard chooses his spells like a craftsman chooses his tools, and the fact that he happens to have <i>Fireball</i> instead of <i>Haste</i> does not say anything about him dramatically. (Necromancy is an exception, incidentally - if your character is willing to animate zombies, that certainly says something about him culturally.) This same phenomenon tends to be true down the line; for example, your superpowers in Vampire are typically static indicators of how your character kicks ass in practical terms, while those same powers rarely say anything about who your character is, what he believes in or how he's interesting as a dramatic actor. In TSoY it's virtually impossible to pick a set of kewl powerz for your character without getting a hefty chunk of cultural stuff to go with it; in this regard the game is similar to Glorantha, which also works from the assumption that if you can fly, then you'll also necessarily have some dramatic religious convictions or such in your backpack.<br/><br/>You'll note that the above difference in approach is more about the content of the game's crunch sheets than about the immediate experience system. As I said above, I think that the more important difference in TSoY's experience system comes from how you spend the points than how you gain them. The two facets are connected, though, as the attitude and motivation the player has for gaining the points is obviously affected by how they are spent: if you're gaining the points to make your character more powerful, that's a different thing than if you're gaining the points to make him more <i>defined</i>. I don't find the player choice nearly so important in the Key system as the fact that the Keys give XP based on dramatic pacing, allowing you more character development when the character goes through dramatic events. While it is useful for the players to choose their own drama in this regard, technically you could get almost all of the benefit from the system by having static Keys as long as they were similarly well-defined for the purpose of dramatic pacing.<br/><br/>(About <i>Heroquest</i> - anybody interested in my point about the TSoY experience system would do well to study that game, as it essentially has the same system except for the Keys. The XP spending is the same in that game, that is, while the way XP is gained is much more traditional, with the GM doling out a couple of points after each session like clockwork. How this influences the nature of each game is an interesting thing to explore.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286378/#Comment_286378" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T03:00:27+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  3:00AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, awesome. So what makes TSoY different, and the games that follow it, is not, necessarily that the XP system is keyed to non-combat story oriented factors, or that the outcome is necessarily character driven or character defining as opposed to tactical/strategic, but that TSoY does this very intentionally and in a deliberate and focused way.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I would argue that Werewolf (and specifically not Vampire) does the exact same thing. For instance, acquiring Renown means huge things in terms of how your character is perceived and treated by the society to which he belongs, that the means of gaining Renown (as defined by Auspice, which is the character's social function in Werewolf's pseudo-tribal society) is based on often hard won personal decisions that can't just be chosen by the player but must be arrived at through in fiction events, and that Gifts (Werewolf's Kewl Powerz) must be acquired by parlaying with various spirits of the Umbra, a metaphysical quest on the part of the character.<br/>\n<br/>\nI must sound like some kind of White Wolf apologist or something, but I'm not trying to be. It's just that the impression I got from the initial poster (I could be way wrong on this) was that he was trying to see if these kinds of tools/modes of play are unique to story games or necessary/important to their identity. I'm assuming that that's opposed to "traditional" RPG's (like Werewolf). The point I'm making is that those same types of systems do exist in traditional RPG's, they're just meant to be easily ignored. Seriously. All that stuff in the last paragraph is, as far as I can tell, true about Werewolf and implicit in the text, but its also meant to not rock peoples "this is how we learned to RP" boat so its very possible to play Werewolf like a furry dungeon crawl with way too much flavor text.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it sounds to me like the revolution in Heroquest/TSoY is that it recognized what it wanted to do with its XP system/reward system and then made that explicit, thus requiring (if its not too strong a word) players to adjust their play styles to the game if THIS was the game they wanted to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that seem like a correct assumption, or am I grasping at straws here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286381/#Comment_286381" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T03:39:33+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  3:39AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gameplay techniques very rarely are completely new and original. I'm not usually nearly as interested in originality in my own work as I am in living gameplay traditions and dominant accepted wisdom. That is, it's much more interesting to me if the people designing for and playing Deadlands usually thought and implemented play in certain ways than to hear that truly, in our group in Oklahoma City in 1995 we threw out half of that game's GMing advice and totally made it play like Everway. Nice for you, but perhaps not that useful for anybody else. In this regard game texts are much more important than individual experiences of play, although of course the individual experience is important for the person himself.<br/><br/>I'm rather minimally read on Werewolf myself, having only skimmed the original books years ago, so I'll totally take anybody's word on their deeper nuances. To me it sounds like a very interesting premise that a big part of the game would involve having your character treat with different spirits and make choices as to which spirits to integrate into his own worldview. Whitewolf games in general tend to be full of these sorts of really cool "missed opportunities" in that they talked the talk, but largely failed to walk the walk when it comes to successfully implementing game procedures and advice that would have made playing the struggle with the beast within or whatever a given game's idea was a reality. It's a very interesting historiographical question as to whether WW missed the boat in this regard because the game texts and design were limited by current presumptions, or because the ideas were simply so new and radical that only a minority of the audience could and would shift from their party-based superhero paradigm into playing towards the ideas presented in these games. It would take a very concerned in-depth look to determine whether a modern game's game text really is any more clear and explicit and mechanically useful about how to achieve these goals - it would be a pretty interesting result if one were to conclude that actually the original Werewolf was not any worse as a text, it was just published at the wrong time to truly get traction for its more experimental features, thus resulting in a play culture that never could verbalize and transmit a coherent dramatic model of play. I never was a player of WW games or most of '90s design in general myself, so I don't have the immediate textual expertise to hazard a serious guess on the matter.<br/><br/>But anyway, I totally agree with you point, Nolan: like many other rpg procedure innovations this Key thing is mostly a big deal for us because it gives a name and explicitly writes down ideas and implementations that surely were around for decades before, but never got any serious treatments as unified game texts that would reliably transmit the idea. RPG textual history in general has suffered a lot from extreme conservatism in what gets written down and what's considered mere "GMing technique", so it's no wonder that we have plentiful examples of just this sort of thing. Scene framing, bang-based scenario design, dramatically oriented NPC play, relationship maps and many other techniques are all things that I'm absolutely sure were around in local play cultures in the '80s already. At least part of the reason for why this stuff never made it into the actual game texts seems to be because of respect for the GM's independence and the traditional form of a rpg text: a roleplaying game in the mainstream tradition consists of a character modeling section, a task resolution section, perhaps some monster and reward lists and GMing instructions. This ossified model of what a game text should include and in what role kept many things that are now appreciated and considered new and modern limited as GMing tips at best, written in the form of suggestions and utterly inefficient in actually making a group play one game differently from another.<br/><br/>Also, about the requirements of the game, definitely with you on that. There's a world of difference between a big-tent game text that tries not to rock the boat of pre-existing GMing philosophy, whatever that might be for a given GM, and a game that stridently refuses to work even superficially if it's not played according to the paradigm it's designed for. I rather adore the latter type of game text exactly because I believe them to be a major factor in our modern ability to talk about different styles of play and distinguish various techniques and how they affect the game. The traditional way of writing is teh sux in comparison for how it encourages you to just bolt a new dicing mechanic and setting into your pre-existing way of playing, completely failing to jolt you out of your assumptions about the way the game should go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286426/#Comment_286426" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T09:30:19+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  9:30AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding White Wolf - I think a much closer parallel to TSOY's Keys is Nature/Demeanor.  <br/><br/>Nature and Demeanor in the Storyteller are very much like Keys.  They are personality-based traits that say you get Willpower points when you perform a particular action.  So to compare, here's a Nature/Demeanor trait from Vampire: \n<blockquote><b>Caregiver</b><br/>You are a person who is always trying to help those around you.  Always concerned and empathetic to the needs and sorrows of the unfortunate, you struggle to make a difference.  A Caregiver is the nurturer, the saint, the quintessential mother - though it is as often a male Trait as a female one.  People around you depend on your stability and strength to keep them steady and centered.  You are the one people turn to when they have a problem. <br/> - Regain a point of Willpower whenever you successfully take an action that protects or nurtures someone else.  It can be as small as a smile of support, or providing a shoulder to lean on.  The other person must in some way be helped by what you did, but they need not acknowledge it openly.</blockquote>\nAnd here is a Key from TSOY: \n<blockquote><b>Key of Conscience</b><br/>Your character has a soft spot for those weaker than their opponents. Gain 1 XP every time your character helps someone who cannot help themselves. Gain 2 XP every time your character defends someone with might who is in danger and cannot save themselves. Gain 5 XP every time your character takes someone in an unfortunate situation and changes their life to where they can help themselves. Buyoff: Ignore a request for help.</blockquote>\nThere are some things that stand out in contrast.  The White Wolf trait has a lot more descriptive text, where TSOY leaves you to work out for yourself what it means on a personal level.  This may be better for new role-players, but experienced players may benefit from more open interpretation.  <br/><br/>Another important difference is that while you can change Nature and Demeanor in Storyteller, they are always required.  In TSOY, you may have multiple or no Keys - and buying them off gains you XP.  This makes them a little more dynamic and player-controlled.  <br/><br/>Also, in Storyteller, Nature/Demeanor are separate and arguably less important a reward system than XP (although Willpower is vital).

But I know very well RQ II and RQ III having played them for years, so I can talk about them.<br/><br/>Apart from all the other systemic differences (RQ and tSoY are really different animals: if you don't mind a little Forge jargon, the first is unapologetic simulationist and the other is narrativist, and even this doesn't cover all the difference in philosophy and gameplay between the two) and trying to concentrate on that specific difference (and it's not easy, seeing that there rules don't exist in a vacuum), I would say that:<br/><br/>- In RQ, the value of the skills reflect in part (ignoring for the simplicity's sake the effect of blind luck on the experience rolls, the different starting values o the skills and the option of simply train a never used skill) the use of the skill in play, in other words, how much your character did rely on the skill in a life-or-death situation. By the other hand, the use of the skill increase the value of the skill, that become even more useful to you and you use it more often (this tended to create characters really, really good at fighting and for nothing else, by the way). It' a self.-increasing loop, that make your character "always even more like himself than before".  If you are an archer, you will become more and more skilled with the bow and you will be even more an archer, relying less and less on other skills that did not increase and started at a lower value.<br/>It's true that there is a leveling effect built in the way it's easier to increase a lower skill, but almost nobody in real play risked the life of his character by using a worse skill in a life-or-death situation, so it's effect was minor. (some GM allowed to "fishing for experience rolls", using lower skills in everyday situations to get to increase them, but it was really considered bad play in the game's literature - as I said, unapologetic simulationist, and it wasn't "realistic" having all these people changing weapons every round against unarmed opponents...)<br/>All this made changing a character in another direction really, really difficult and time-consuming. You would have to accept a much higher risk using lower skills for a lot of time (this in a game already so lethal that it was called "limbquest" referring to all the arms and legs cut away in a single combat...). I have never seen ANYONE doing that.  <br/>Another option was to change religion, but the rules penalized for doing this, and you would even get specialty cult spirits after you bent on revenge.<br/>The only real change option left to character, at least in Glorantha, was to become illuminated. i.e. "one of the bad guys" (it's not really true in later literature, but at the time of RQ II these people were depicted as the scum of the setting...)<br/><br/>- TSoY (I use this as example because I still have not played the Solar System): you get xp that you can spend on a skill you did not use, the amount of xp is not tied to the use of any skill and not even always tied to something the character has to do. Changing is good and get you more xp.<br/><br/>Example:  <br/><br/>Grunwald, in RQ: a ferocious storm buller, lethal with an axe.  If he want to become a pacifist and never use an axe again, he drop in combat skill from 85% to 30% and he is attacked by reprisal spirits. Simply put, he's as good as dead.<br/><br/>Grunwalf in tSoY: let's say that he follow a cult similar to Storm Bull and he is really good with an axe. In a figth he goes berserk and kill a defenseless child.  He has the key "I don't care who I kill, to destroy chaos".<br/>If he goes on like before (as the RQ character is forced to do to simply have a chance of survival) he get what, 1 or 3xp?<br/>If he decide to change his ways after that murder, he get instead 10 xp MORE that he can immediately use to buy some pool points that will make him stronger.<br/><br/>I hope that I was able to show the difference.  As I said, they are not even the same animal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286446/#Comment_286446" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T11:46:08+00:00" title="August 15, 2010 11:46AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>What about change mechanics in a game like RuneQuest (not the Mongoose edition, because I have no knowledge of how it works) or any of the other basic roleplay riffs... where what you do determines how you improve.

While I think there are some problems in implementation, I think the principle of BRP checks is to have the characters evolve to fit the action of the game.  For example, if I want to advance my Battle Ability as a player in TSOY, I might look for opportunities to fulfill one of my Keys - to defend the faith of others, say.  If I want to do the same in a BRP-based game, I just... do battle.  In principle, this helps the game evolve to reflect what players want to do.  <br/><br/>I think a big issue is what aspect of characterization you are focusing on.  Some games focus more on skills and powers, as opposed to psychological traits like conscience or faith or bloodlust.  BRP is an example, but so are Don't Rest Your Head or The Shab-al-Hiri Roach.  What makes characters who they are is more about what they are good at.  <br/><br/>Another feature of BRP is that awards come from regular use of the mechanics.  Another example of this is Dogs in the Vineyard.  I think this focuses the mechanical action of gameplay more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286487/#Comment_286487" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T14:00:03+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  2:00PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looking at BRP as evolving characters towards what the players want to do is problematic in that this view necessarily requires you to interpret the wishes of the players in terms of the game's skill categories. Is this categorization really pertinent in any way to the wishes and plans of the players? Do players think that "I want my character to climb a lot" and therefore he's happy when the system shapes his character into a good climber? Perhaps this is true, often older games astound me by how static the view about character can be. In a more dramatic or immersive game I would expect the player to frame his expectations about his character in terms of fictional goals instead of skills, but perhaps the Runequest character might be viewed differently due to the essentially static framework the character exists in: the character exists so the player can participate in adventures, and therefore the plans the player has for his character can be expressed in skill development terms.<br/><br/>In comparison, in TSoY you wouldn't presumably have any reason to want to advance a character's Battle Ability as an isolated desire; you would rather want to defeat somebody, and as response to this motivation you would expend some Advances you'd stored away earlier to bump the Battle Ability.

I think for a lot of players, their goals as a player are more about <i>types</i> of action than about particular fictional goals.  i.e. A given player might want "more fights" or "more mysteries" or "more romance" in their game rather than particular in-game goals like "Defeat Baron Harvald by whatever means."  There are definitely implementation issues, like characters switching off weapons in the adventure to get checks on all of the individual weapon skills.  And the breakdown of BRP skills may not map well to types of preferred action.  <br/><br/>Still, I think that the principle can also work with immersive and dramatic goals.  For some characters, they want to do the thing they like - i.e. For my PC Rocky, playing music was his goal - it wasn't really the the money or the fame he was after.  A mercenary warrior might just like to fight, without regard to the side he is fighting for (or even if he could make a better living by another means).  As for drama...   For a lot of drama, the fictional goal of the character is more of what's called a "MacGuffin" (from Hitchcock).  That is, Sam Spade may want to get his hands on the Maltese Falcon - but the scriptwriter isn't concerned so much with whether he gets it as what sort of action he has to go through in order to get it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286579/#Comment_286579" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T22:16:21+00:00" title="August 15, 2010 10:16PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so here's were I was coming from with the whole RQ thing. The only version of RQ I ever played was the Avalon Hill edition (not sure which that was) and it wasn't set in Gloratha, but in a fictionalized late classical world. The thing that struck me about it was that the game was all about all these different cultures at different levels of development. Eero mentioned the idea of the characters in TSoY change adaptively based on the things happening in the game ("What the above ultimately means is that in TSoY your character learns the magical language of Zu foremost because he is given the opportunity and he appreciates the culture that comes along with the skill, rather than because the player read about Zu from the rulebook and wants to add this facet to his character.") In the RQ rules I'm familiar with, if your character was stranded on a desert island and had to get on with the natives, he would gain desert island survival skills and pick up language and cultural skill appropriate to the islanders, in short, he would change over time to adapt to the fiction. I'm not saying they're the same thing (the two XP systems) or trying to minimalize the differences between them, just making an observation.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast note on White Wolf and Werewolf, there were no Nature/Demeanor traits in Werewolf.

These are courtesy of Luke Crane and Jared Sorensen, though the interpretations in this context are my own and you can't blame them for those.<br/><br/><i><b>Game design is mind control</b></i>. Game mechanics are there to ensure that everyone's behaviour is in-line with what the game requires, not what they'd usually do or have been conditioned to through long-term play of that game or similar games. The corollary is that if everyone's behaviour is already in-line with what the game requires - usually due to long-term conditioning - then game mechanics are not required. Sometimes, when a group has played together for a long time and are happy with their experience doing so, they'll try a new game and their conditioning clashes with the mind control imposed by the new mechanics. This makes things feel clunky and stilted. Perhaps the group ought not to play this game, because it doesn't serve their collective agenda; perhaps it is simply a matter of requiring practice with the game to reverse the prior conditioning.<br/><br/>but:<br/><br/><i><b>Role-playing games are Games</b></i>. This is contentious, of course, but if you agree with the idea that when we play this <i>game</i>, the elements we manipulate through play ought to be (directly or indirectly, a la the Fruitful Void idea) the thing the game is <i>about</i>, and if you're playing a game that's focused on the idea of <i>telling a dynamic story</i> then Keys/Aspects/Beliefs etc make far more sense as play elements than XP or hit points. As mentioned repeatedly above, Keys/Aspects/Beliefs etc govern the <b>transformation of character personality and traits</b>, which is an integral part of dramatic stories. Getting more XP in Pathfinder will transform your character's competence on an ever-increasing axis, but any transformations of the character's personhood is not affected at all - the only reason that would ever happen is due to a long-standing agreement within your group to add these elements to add flavour to the core game.<br/><br/>I think it's frequently overlooked that mechanics such as Keys/Aspects/Beliefs and many other common "story gamish" elements do clash with the conditioning imposed by the vast majority of game designs, and that in order to get full enjoyment out of a particular game you ought to practice practice practice. As a case in point, playing Dogs in the Vineyard with people for the first time often feels very clumsy, as people realize they can call on all kinds of traits to get more dice and "win", resulting in a contrived narrative. After a while of playing that way, people realize that they're putting the cart before the horse, and instead start shaping the narrative such that they'll be put into positions where their traits make narrative sense. After that, they realize that when a trait isn't bang-on for a given conflict, they shouldn't use it - not only does it create a worse narrative if they do, but the fallout they collect when they "lose" also serves to improve the narrative. The reason that's not intuitively obvious is because the game's explicit admonition that <i>characters ought to be retired</i> is seen as a fail condition by 99% of players, and it takes actually experiencing the game in action for an extended amount of time to understand that the game is not "about" becoming more competent at saving the towns from evil.<br/><br/>I'm still plowing through Apocalypse World, but one thing stuck out at me as specifically addressing some of the concerns above: while the central mechanic is the execution of particular "moves", you are <b>never</b> to mention the move by name. The game text will refer to "acting under fire" as a mechanical um, <i>thing</i>, but the resulting narrative is not intended to be "you're refusing to provide the night vision goggles despite being seduced? well, you're acting under fire now" but rather "Olaf is distressed, tossing and turning in his sleep, guilt-ridden by his failure to provide for the needs of his more than generous lover, fearing that she will leave him soon to continue his bleak existence, alone". I suspect you won't get to that later state without practice though, much like it takes time to go from "you hit for 5 hit points" to "your sword finds a chink in his armour and cuts a deep gash in his chest".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286810/#Comment_286810" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T13:50:01+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  1:50PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually...re AW, I believe it's only the MC who explicitly hides his moves.

On reflection, I've come around to thinking that XP based rewards are probably a little too <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">coercive</span> compelling.<br/><br/>I really like Gamist play, and I really like Narrativist play (Sim play, not so much.)  If I had to say it, I'm "more" Gamey.  I think I *enjoy* Narrativist/Story-based play/RP more.  But when push comes to shove, that Gamist part of my brain is always going to be a little louder, I'm always going to feel that little twinge of "I know this is dumb, but..."  If the game is very Story-focused, it often won't have any sort of punitive mechanics for doing a demonstrably dumb (but in character/story) thing.  But if there's much Gamist crunch going on, that little guy in the back of my brain is going to tell me exactly what the "right" thing the rules (or the situation and the GMs expected reaction) are telling me to do is at any point in time (especially at character creation.)  That's usually enough cognitive dissonance that the Gamist side wins.  So I'm unlikely to play a minotaur with a deathwish if the system is likely to kill me, or to skip the planning stage of a shadowrun and rush in, etc.<br/><br/>These Aspect/Key/Belief mechanics take the edge off for me, and placate that Gamist voice in the back of my head.  Now I can happily take the "Enough planning!" Aspect, say to hell with it and charge on in.  Gamist voice gets a cookie, I get Story-fun.  If it bites me in the ass, I still have a FP, the story is moving forward, everything is good.  If someone else at the table doesn't have that little Gamist voice, we've leveled the playing field.  Now a much broader range of the Gamist-Narrativist spectrum can play happily at the same table.  *That* is what I like about these mechanics, they avoid some of that risk-aversion that's inherent in human psychology.<br/><br/>The risk is that they might take it too far, to the point of compelling the player, rather than just removing a punishment for a non-optimal action.  Now that you bring it up, I do think that XP/Permanent benefits might be too far on the compulsion side.  XP are just too big a cookie for Gamist-voice to ignore.  I know in the AW one-shot I was in at PAX, I kind of felt obligated to Open Myself to the Maelstrom a few times because my Weird was checked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/294809/#Comment_294809" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-27T14:14:15+00:00" title="September 27, 2010  2:14PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's brilliant, <b>cy</b>, I think that spells it out nicely for me.

One day he came down to the floor and wrote a giant '3' in chalk on the floor.  Word eventually got around that this was the number of engines produced by the previous shift.  Apparently this was enough to engage the workers' spirit of competition, and the next day, the day shift produced 4 engines.  The manager came down, erased the '3', and wrote '4' on the floor.<br/><br/>It's a bit like a pinball game - the points go up.  What's the point of points?  Nothing, they're useless - they're not an inherent incentive, except that they give you a means of measuring yourself.  If you, for the sheer joy of mastery, decide to engage the system, the points give you feedback on how you're doing.<br/><br/>So keys are a first step to this - the incentives they lead to may not be inherently valuable (particularly if you were already a pinball master who learned on machines that don't show a score), but they can give you a means of measuring whether what you're doing is what the designer intended, and helps align a group of people around a particular way of playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_294972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
