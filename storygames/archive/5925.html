It had space for NPC summaries, PC summaries, etc, and a load of mnemonic key phrases along the bottom (e.g. "escalate!"). In fact, I think there was a whole thread of similar things (although that one contained the most Win).<br/><br/>I have failed my search roll many times, and I can't find post or thread. Can you help? Will you help?<br/><br/><br/>rob                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
