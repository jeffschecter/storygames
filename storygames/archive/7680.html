I think Ive never had this really nice reception in a forum before! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, returning to the games... I really dont know. My contact with role-playing games was limited mainly to the traditional type (Shadowrun, Gurps, Pendragon, etc.). So I dont really know what to ask for suggestions. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne think got me excited about these story/indie/hippie/-kind of games was its relative low prep-time. They seem like those boardgames from my childhood - "Clue!" and "Monopoly" were two famous ones here in Brazil - where you just join the group, sit down and play. Focused theme, fast ( and ingenious) rules, group interplay, etc. This is a plus for me, since I dont have spare time left these days ( work, study, family, children, taken all my time).<br/>\n<br/>\nIm really excited to know all these games you guys suggested.<br/>\n<br/>\n- - - <br/>\n<br/>\nOn a side note, I bought the Mountain Witch pdf from IPR. I have 2 questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n  1) the PDF doesnt come with covers (front nor back), has just 9 color illustrations, and the pages seem to have no layout art nowhere (aside some japanese kanji in the center of some pages). Is this right? The original printed version is "crude" like this, or its just the PDF version that is "ripped" for easy of printing? (I dont mean to call it a bad designed book - the contrary, its simple and effective - but Ive heard its art layout was so good... )<br/>\n<br/>\n  2) reading it, it seems a really cool game that I would like to try really soon, but some rules got me worried: a) the "sucesse margin" seems too arbitrary; b) the Fate system seems too loose. It could doesnt promote the players for building its Fates in game, so some players can simply ignore its Fates, I think. If theres no reward for building up the Fates, what mitigates the players to do so? (maybe if I actually play the game, this may prove a false impression, but I dont know... )<br/>\n<br/>\n  Thats it.

(maybe if I actually play the game, this may prove a false impression, but I dont know... )</blockquote>\nThose are good points.  Here's how those issues have worked out in play for me:<br/><br/>Success Margin: Generally what happens is that, barring a lucky roll, rolling one die against another you're going to get a very low success margin.  That means that players have to work very hard to get exactly what they want.  This encourages people to spend trust a lot more than they otherwise would.  You don't just spend trust to win a difficult fight, but also to make sure you get exactly what you want.<br/><br/>Fates: Really, these are the whole game, so building up your Dark Fate is its own reward.  If you're not interested in doing that, then maybe you're playing the wrong game.  That said, there are certain advantages that come to characters who introduce their Dark Fate.  Players have much more authority over the content of the story when they're introducing their Fate.  That means that players who ignore their Fate will have much less influence over the direction of the game as a whole.  <br/><br/>To some extent, you need all the players to be on board with the idea of Fates before the game starts.  You can't play the game exactly how you'd play D&amp;D, and expect a great story to emerge - the players need to do a lot more work than they ordinarily would, deciding how to introduce their Fate, and doing that in a way that's exciting to everyone.  If the players aren't excited about doing that, it might not be the best game for that group.  There are several tricks mentioned in the book for helping out players who are finding it difficult to reveal their fate.  The most famous is known as the "Mountain Witch Trick", and it involves directly asking the players questions that let them reveal things about their Fates.  Such as:<br/><br/>There's a dead body swinging from the branch of this tree.  Who is it?<br/><br/>The arrow has a message wrapped around its shaft.  What does it say?<br/><br/>and so on.<br/><br/>Hope that's helpful!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171189/#Comment_171189" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-25T07:55:35+00:00" title="September 25, 2008  7:55AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vini_lessa</cite>1) the PDF doesnt come with covers (front nor back), has just 9 color illustrations, and the pages seem to have no layout art nowhere (aside some japanese kanji in the center of some pages).

The kanji characters, I believe, always face new chapter headings. It has a modern aesthetic, with the blocks of sidebar text cutting slightly into the main body paragraphs, that I've always found interesting. That, plus the fact that the art was actually printed in color, is probably enough to get some artistic accolades in the indie rpg circles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa" title="vini_lessa"><img alt="vini_lessa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vini_lessa">vini_lessa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171555/#Comment_171555" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T14:13:30+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  2:13PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n[quote]There are several tricks mentioned in the book for helping out players who are finding it difficult to reveal their fate.

It really depends on why the player introduced the monk to begin with.  The key thing to remember is that players have complete content authority, <b>so long as it's related to their Dark Fate</b>.  So the player can introduce the Monk, so long as it's related to their Dark Fate.  So probably the Monk shows up to relay some information, or maybe just their existance is a clue to the character's Fate.  The player says what the Monk knows, if it's relevant to their Fate.  If another player wants to interact with the Monk, again, it depends on if it's relevant to their Fate.  If they decide that the Monk also knows something about their Fate, then they have authority over narrating that.  <b>The GM is responsible for all content not related to Dark Fates</b>.  That means that if another player wants to kill the Monk, the GM rolls dice for the Monk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo" title="Ronaldo"><img alt="Ronaldo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171621/#Comment_171621" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T21:38:16+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  9:38PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From your first post, I knew you were from Brazil too.

I definitely am glad I made the investment.  I also printed off a copy of My Life With Master and a small pamphlet of John Wick's Wilderness of Mirrors.
