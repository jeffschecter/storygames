I particularly like "Diagnostic Ward".<br/><br/>However, it would be nice to have some more guidances on what "issues" are, and what to do with them/how to handle them. (I could use a Frame/Resolve procedure, a la Fiasco, being helpful here, on a sidenote.)<br/><br/>I like some of the hidden behaviours/choices (for instance, refusing to do poorly as a doctor in your personal issue will often mean you're killing the patient!).<br/><br/>What happens if a player doesn't take any dice for themselves? How do we resolve their final fate?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451873/#Comment_451873" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-16T21:45:00+00:00" title="March 16, 2016  9:45PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Diagnostic Ward is quite possibly a game I could expand on at some point... but saying that, so is Underfoot.<br/><br/>Anyway, my answer to most questions about Diagnostic Ward is "Watch House," but to address the case of a doctor who takes no dice for themselves during the game, then technically they have less 1-3 <i>and</i> less 4-6 results than the patient's condition. That would mean the outcome for their issues is that it is both "complicated but ok" and "not all bad," so I would let the patient narrate the whole outcome instead of just adding a twist to it: this outcome should be an extension of the issue rather than a resolution of it, so it might carry over to the next case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451874/#Comment_451874" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-16T21:51:29+00:00" title="March 16, 2016  9:51PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What do you think about an optional rule where a player with no dice simply rolls one at the end?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451875/#Comment_451875" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-16T21:55:17+00:00" title="March 16, 2016  9:55PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 17, 2016 8:10AM by James_Mullen.">edited March 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, go for it: I've just started a whole series of blog posts about hacking games or their parts, so I can hardly complain if you start hacking mine! ;-)<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> I've updated Diagnostic Ward with some examples of testing &amp; treating patients, character issues and Paul_T's suggested hack for ending the game with no dice.
