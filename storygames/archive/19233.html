Man vs Society can be slightly more obscure, but depending on how you want to handle it, it can be imported either through deliberate conflict, or by a motivation-based system, like Spiritual Attributes (The Riddle of Steel) or Beliefs (Burning Wheel). Similarly, Man vs Self can be explored as a theme through those motivation-based reward systems. <br/><br/>But how does one make use of Man vs Nature? Sure, you can be as direct as dropping a grizzly bear in front of the party and making them fight it, but that doesn't come close to capturing the feeling involved, or making that struggle a meaningful one. <br/><br/>For a long while, I've wanted to set up a campaign in such a way that exploration was an important part of the story: Charting uncharted lands, coming across the ruins of lost civilizations, the whole thing. While ruins and dungeons and whatever else are a way to make things interesting, is it possible to make man vs nature itself an interesting and vital aspect of the journey? It seems to largely be either hand-waved away, or worse: devolve into a series of rolls for fatigue or travel speed. <br/><br/>Has anyone had any real breakthroughs on this? Or is it simply something that doesn't translate well to a gaming environment. I suppose it is hard to be cold, starving, soaked and annoyed at the rain when the player in reality is warm, dry, comfortable, and eating potato chips. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428530/#Comment_428530" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T00:09:13+00:00" title="February 21, 2014 12:09AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exploration is a harder challenge I think, but games with a heavy survival theme take stabs at the overall Man vs Nature idea.<br/><br/>Oftentimes The Quiet Year (by Mcdaldno) is full of Man vs Nature (well, Community-vs-Nature, but functionally the same) challenges. The most overt I can think of is the card in fall that involves a natural disaster, but many scarcities and other cards will often lead to nature-based trouble.<br/><br/>Another that is very explicitly about survival is Ross Cowman's upcoming HVE Water (maybe it's still up and available for beta, I don't remember). While I haven't played it, every indication I've gathered is that it's pretty good at that cold/starving/soaked feel you mention.<br/><br/>These both include Man vs Nature, and one makes it very central to its experience, but I'd say that they both use MvN as a lens to provide context and danger to more personal stories. In HVE Water, most of your physical adversity comes from Nature, but it's about the Survivor's reflections and interactions-through-memory with their Loved Ones (played by the other people at the table). In Quiet Year, Nature is often just the impetus to trigger intra-community struggles. Neither both start and end with MvN in my opinion, which I think is pretty good reasoning to use MvN: as context and drama spurs.<br/>Given that these are social games though. I think that as long as there's other characters around to bounce off of and interact with, those will hijack what the game is about.<br/><br/>On the other hand, MvN might be good for solo or two-player play, where lone individuals against nature can play without other interactions changing what the challenge is. I don't think groups of people against nature are great for delving far into MvN because if they're played like people and heavy scarcity is involved, they'll start bouncing off each other and using MvN as context to fuel MvM conflicts.<br/><br/>Of course, all this is talking about isolating a game where MvN is overwhelmingly the explored conflict form to the partial exclusion of the others, which needn't be the case. If you're content with it being a vital element of play in the form of context and drama spurs, there are options!<br/><br/>(also worth a mention is Torchbearer, which does this through the very carefully limited supply capacity and ticking clock of fatigue, which isn't as tangential or superimposed-feeling as, say, D&amp;D's fatigue. I don't think Torchbearer is as predominantly MvN as the others I mentioned, but it's worth tossing out)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428533/#Comment_428533" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T00:33:26+00:00" title="February 21, 2014 12:33AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it fair to classify most OSR games as MvN?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428534/#Comment_428534" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T01:03:52+00:00" title="February 21, 2014  1:03AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there any way to get access to Torchbearer, or I simply have to be patient?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428536/#Comment_428536" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T01:22:08+00:00" title="February 21, 2014  1:22AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Is there any way to get access to Torchbearer, or I simply have to be patient?</blockquote>\nIt's out there in the wild! <a href="http://www.burningwheel.com/store/index.php/torchbearer.html" rel="nofollow">Here's the Torchbearer store page.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428537/#Comment_428537" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T02:47:13+00:00" title="February 21, 2014  2:47AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2014 2:47AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I suppose it is hard to be cold, starving, soaked and annoyed at the rain when the player in reality is warm, dry, comfortable, and eating potato chips.</blockquote>Huh?  By that logic, wouldn't it be hard to engage in violent conflict when the player's life is peaceful?  I think all it takes is the desire to explore those hardships (cold, starving, etc.).  Bring that desire, and rolls for fatigue and travel speed can actually become fun, because things like being tired and late are allowed to have consequences.<br/><br/>As for breakthroughs, the best published game I can recommend is <a href="http://www.j-rpg.com/ryuutama/" rel="nofollow">Ryuutama</a>.  If you have an arduous travel and rough night, you may be at 1/4 of your hit points for the next day's encounters!  The encounters themselves are generally nature-based as well, at least in flavor (monster encounters, but with things like giant plants or animals).<br/><br/>Aside from that game, I've encountered Man vs Nature <i>moments</i> in many RPGs.  Getting sick in Mouse Guard is a big deal, for instance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428540/#Comment_428540" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T03:25:55+00:00" title="February 21, 2014  3:25AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Is there any way to get access to Torchbearer, or I simply have to be patient?</blockquote>\nIt's out there in the wild! <a href="http://www.burningwheel.com/store/index.php/torchbearer.html" rel="nofollow">Here's the Torchbearer store page.</a></blockquote>\nGeez, paying money for things?

For most people, combat is inherently exciting - both for the challenge moment, and for the tension it brings. Anyone who is at all into the game they are playing on some level cares whether or not their character is maimed or dies. I've met very few who legitimately care if their character is <i>uncomfortable</i> or experiencing hardship. Wet, cold, hungry, tired -- these tend to fall under the same umbrella as Fear in horror games. You can't just present them and assume the player will care in the same way the character would. You have to handle them differently to see that effect.<br/><br/>That said, I'll have to check out mouseguard. I'm always worried about adding mechanics to a game, for some reason. Especially for sub-systems like getting sick, tired, etc. I suppose if I'm doing an exploration heavy thing though, I may have to suck it up and set something up.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428567/#Comment_428567" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T13:21:53+00:00" title="February 21, 2014  1:21PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2014 1:23PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, gotcha.

If the players aren't excited about Man vs Wet/Cold/Hungry/Tired, a game probably won't get them there...  Unless there are consequences!  That HP loss in Ryuutama means that being Wet/Cold/Hungry/Tired is <i>not</i> just there for its own sake -- it matters to things like character survival.

Crucially, the statuses of Tired/Hungry/Injured/Lost replace the typical hitpoint system (that you might've just thrown into your game out of reverend D&amp;D traditions). So even when you're fighting an angry snake in the underbrush the damage it does is expressed in the same terms as the ravages of nature.

Getting "Angry" or "Injured" are cool and colorful, but are not at all about some "Man vs Nature" struggle.  "Hungry" and "Sick" are more like it, but you won't encounter "Sick" unless the GM specifically decides to use a disease as their source of obstacles.  IMO, Mouse Guard certainly has enough content with the right sort of flavor that a group <i>could</i> work a lot of "vs Nature" into their play.  But if the characters' Beliefs are all about social stuff -- friends, family, enemies, troop-mates, rank, trade, position in the Guard or in mouse society -- then Nature applies to 50% of play at best.  <br/><br/>Ryuutama, on the other hand, both mandates travel and makes you deal with its hardships every single time you do it.  it just seems more <i>focused</i> on nature, to me.  But I've only actually played it once, so who knows, maybe groups will spend less play time on nature as the game's systems for it become routine.  I don't think I would...<br/><br/>If I were GMing a "Mouse Guard vs Nature" game, I think I'd introduce a drought or a flood or something before character creation, and instruct everyone to write beliefs about that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428627/#Comment_428627" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-22T12:34:22+00:00" title="February 22, 2014 12:34PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, I like the sound of "terrain = monster", so I'll ask: how do SWT monsters work?

To "traverse" the monster, you have to "defeat" it in combat. After that, you can traverse the terrain anytime you like. (I suppose this is somewhat story-like: in a novel, we might read about the Hobbits sneaking through the dark forest once, but on subsequent trips it just happens.)<br/><br/>Here's a quote:\n<blockquote>Terrain: The monster\u2019s not a monster but a place. Say which stat the characters can use to traverse it. Strength to hack through vines, endurance to cross vast dunes or swim through a tunnel underwater, skill to go along a narrow slippery ledge, perception to navigate a maze, etc. The monster\u2019s damage checkboxes are called traversal checkboxes instead, and it gets two rows: individual traversal and group traversal. <br/><br/>The monster gets a number of individual traversal checkboxes precisely as it would get damage checkboxes. Then, by default the monster gets twice as many group traversal checkboxes.<br/><br/>Improved effect: For +2XV, it gets three times as many group traversal checkboxes as individual traversal checkboxes.<br/><br/>For the players, marking traversal checkboxes means that their characters make progress through the terrain. If a player marks individual traversal checkboxes, that means that her character alone makes progress; if she marks group traversal checkboxes, that means that her character helps the entire group make progress.</blockquote>\nYou go round-by-round, trying different tactics, while the terrain makes "attacks" against you. The monster abilities in <i>Storming...</i> are quite varied, so there's a lot of possible ways this can look. <br/><br/>For example, Vincent lists two different kinds of terrain monsters in the sample adventure. One is a creepy forest, which, if it succeeds in its attacks, it means you make noise and draw attention to yourself. Do that too much and you attract some monsters who wander the forest, and you get into a real fight instead. The other terrain type has noxious fumes and its attack drains your endurance stat if it succeeds.<br/><br/>I haven't tried it, so I can't say whether it's satisfying or not!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428640/#Comment_428640" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-22T17:13:26+00:00" title="February 22, 2014  5:13PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2014 5:14PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds fun to me!

Because of nature the protagonists got bored, miserably wet, terribly cold, hungry, depressed, ill, etc.  Excitement and heroics did happen, but mostly the story was about continuing despite discomfort and after it is all done there are a few major (mostly distant) changes but mostly life goes back to how it was before (which you can appreciate more now).<br/><br/>The movies are an adventure story.  All those discomforts are overlooked.  The quest is a series of exciting moments separated by only minor lulls.<br/><br/>In other words, Man vs Nature teaches us that fighting the dragon is the <i>least</i> important part of the quest.  In fact, someone else will probably do that fighting.  Our role in a war is to show up, bear the tedium and discomfort, realize we contribute even when not fighting the dragon, and now and then do something very heroic with our squad--or maybe even to save our squad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428666/#Comment_428666" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-23T16:26:42+00:00" title="February 23, 2014  4:26PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Jason's game is called The Climb.

The story/backdrop is somewhat Man vs. Nature (mountaineers are trying to conquer a mountain), but the actual gameplay is all about interpersonal drama (shocking in a Jason Morningstar game, I know). There are affairs and revenge plots and jealousy. Ultimately, the concept of the mountain (and an approaching storm) puts pressure on these personal issues, but isn't in any sense a meaningful challenge to the people in the story. If you fail to climb the mountain, it's because someone sabotaged the expedition or decided to betray a team member, or decided to say behind, that kind of thing.<br/><br/>(If someone has a contrary opinion on this, I'd be very curious to hear it, however.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428684/#Comment_428684" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-24T02:38:38+00:00" title="February 24, 2014  2:38AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2014 2:39AM by Potemkin.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't think your description is incorrect, Mike, I just disagree about its impact in play.  Getting "Angry" or "Injured" are cool and colorful, but are not at all about some "Man vs Nature" struggle.  "Hungry" and "Sick" are more like it, but you won't encounter "Sick" unless the GM specifically decides to use a disease as their source of obstacles.  IMO, Mouse Guard certainly has enough content with the right sort of flavor that a group <i>could</i> work a lot of "vs Nature" into their play.  But if the characters' Beliefs are all about social stuff -- friends, family, enemies, troop-mates, rank, trade, position in the Guard or in mouse society -- then Nature applies to 50% of play at best.  <br/><br/>If I were GMing a "Mouse Guard vs Nature" game, I think I'd introduce a drought or a flood or something before character creation, and instruct everyone to write beliefs about that.</blockquote>\nMy feeling is that the impact Is great. The effects of nature's challenges (which range from death and debilitating injury to putting you in a foul mood or just wearing you out) tie into the social (being Angry from your near-death in a landslide getting to Hickburgs effects your ability to convince the proud townsmice that they need to evacuate <i>now</i>before the waters rise and drown them all) and then feed back into further challenges (tired from hours of arguing with the eldermice your attempts to shepherd the evacuees over the flooded ford fail and the torrent takes you!). It's such a holistic system of nature-town-nature-town. <br/>Sometimes it can be fighting-a-bear nature conflicts, but MG is always keen to provide context. If there's a bear attacking it's probably going to be spring (hungry bears!) so there's going to be melt water flooding, hungry predators, food shortage, landslides, sudden heavy rain. Literally reading from the "Spring" chapter here. I think this does much to cement the central place of nature as an arena for challenge.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden" title="MartinEden"><img alt="MartinEden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/728/nG1YHA4QTUL1O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MartinEden">MartinEden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428702/#Comment_428702" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-24T08:39:42+00:00" title="February 24, 2014  8:39AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having written all this: Not sure if I've managed to say anything new here. Read and discard if not.<br/><br/>I think that it will depend on the creative agenda of your play. I can't see how to make Man vs Nature the conflict in focus, and at the same time have as your agenda exploring the characters' motivations and beliefs - what I would term in my head as narrativist play. Mind you, I'm not saying you can't have narrativist play against a backdrop of tumultuous nature - The Climb seems to be about this, from what I understand of the above. But at that point, Man vs Nature isn't the focus - it's colour and setting, interesting to riff off to give the character developments poignancy or irony, but not the essential conflict in question.<br/><br/>That may just be my myopia. Feel free to point out a way of doing that. But assuming that I'm right, I'll plow ahead and say that then Man vs Nature would seem to fit better into a challengeful play ("gamist"?) where the focus is on a characters forging against the elements. Particularly, I would think where Nature is Big - not just meeting a grizzly bear on the road to the real issue at hand, but a situation where the protagonist (person, group, settlement) is right out of civilization and in the hands of the natural environment in all its awesome power. Like the OP said, journeys (sea voyages!) would work well for this.<br/><br/>If challengeful play is the thing, then just make sure there are lots of ways of grappling with the problem. Options that the players can choose, even if the situation is pretty desperate and all routes are just degrees of badness. <br/><br/>If you have a situation where endurance is a focus, I would suggest either eliding the whole segment to a single conflict resolution, or figure out moments to highlight on the journey, and have endurance rolls in between impact the highlighted moments. So if the players do badly at conserving water in the desert, they are more thirsty, desperate, and hallucinatory when they come to the sandstorm. If you stay out fishing in the boat in the cold spray and wind, then when the fish appears your hands are numbed and your reactions slowed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428710/#Comment_428710" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-24T10:50:52+00:00" title="February 24, 2014 10:50AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one of the issues here is that Man vs. Nature conflicts tend to be drawn-out, slow-paced affairs, a question of endurance and fortitude and the inner struggle.<br/><br/>Our RPG technology for dealing with this kind of conflict isn't very well-developed yet.

When forces bigger than you refuse to give you a break, can you stave off despair, keep pushing forward, and still choose and act effectively?  Will you ever get through to the "other side" of (relative) comfort, plenty, and rest?  If you make it, you will surely have a new perspective on human life, and your own sturdiness and self-reliance.  Heck, maybe that's true even if you <i>don't</i> make it, but still give it your all until the very end.<br/><br/>Has anyone seen <i>The Grey?</i>  If not here come ***SPOILERS!***<br/><br/>There's a scene near the end where an asshole character who is injured, tired, and slowing the group down decides to abandon the struggle.  He sits down on a log and stares at the natural beauty of the spot and waits to die.  I dunno whether we're "supposed" to view him as a coward and quitter, but to me, he seemed more clear-headed and at peace in that moment than at any other time in the movie.  <br/><br/>I think that's a unique side to Man vs Nature: it's uniquely open to acceptance of defeat.  If you fight someone, or society, or yourself, and lose, well, usually that's tragic.  But if you fight Nature and lose?  Well, maybe it's not crazy to be okay with that.  Nature appeals to some of us in ways that Man and Society don't -- it's older and bigger and more majestic than us, it gives life and takes life from all creatures, it's embodied in legend as gods and spirits... it's not hard to say that, in Man vs Nature, Nature <i>should</i> win.<br/><br/>If I were to roleplay a battle vs Nature, I'd want all these options on the table:<br/>- fight Nature and win<br/>- fight Nature till the very end and die proud<br/>- abandon the fight and die at peace and in awe of Nature                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428741/#Comment_428741" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-24T23:34:16+00:00" title="February 24, 2014 11:34PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>If I were to roleplay a battle vs Nature, I'd want all these options on the table:<br/>- fight Nature and win<br/>- fight Nature till the very end and die proud<br/>- abandon the fight and die at peace and in awe of Nature</blockquote>\nYes yes yes!

Those beliefs can be explored as part of their interaction with nature. Characters can have motivations and beliefs about other things; those beliefs can be altered and informed and pulled into focus through their interaction with nature. Etc.<br/><br/>I mean, it's straightforward, but it's interesting how non-obvious this is to many people (including myself.) I think the degree to which one personally has had significant/meaningful interaction with nature is a big part of why people can or cannot see how this sort of play might work. Personally, I grew up in a city and I live in a city, and so most of my interaction with nature has been of a specific kind, and filtered through a specific lens. It's definitely harder for me to come up with a random 'vs. nature' type conflict that resonates with me than it is to come up with an interpersonal conflict or societal conflict that has the same appeal.<br/><br/>But I mean, there's always literature to fall back on. <i>Moby Dick</i> was a pretty good story.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428777/#Comment_428777" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-25T09:51:01+00:00" title="February 25, 2014  9:51AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Nature" doesn't have to be quite that literal though. <i>Gravity</i> is essentially a vs Nature story, with a little vs Self thrown in. <i>After Earth</i>, while horrible, is also a vs Nature story.

The strength of Urban Fantasy, contemporary horror, and Cyberpunk as settings is that immediate viceral ability to connect to peoples everyday lives and expectations and twist them in ways that have an impact. There's an episode of <i>The Walking Dead</i> (and really Zombie stories are almost all vs Nature or vs Self when you get right down to it) in which the action takes place in a daycare center. The expectations that arise from that are part of why the scene is compelling. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jacksonmalloy" title="jacksonmalloy"><img alt="jacksonmalloy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/618/nNDI3IZ5905UU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jacksonmalloy">jacksonmalloy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428882/#Comment_428882" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T07:01:23+00:00" title="February 27, 2014  7:01AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wish I had something clever or meaningful to say here. Instead, I can only nod along as though knowingly, while letting the smart people do the talking. Very interesting stuff so far.<br/><br/>An aside. We earlier compared the subtlety of bringing man v. nature to play to the subtlety involved in playing horror at the table. It occurs to me though that one of the bigger problems one might face with that approach is the actual impact of getting the players to feel their character's emotions.<br/><br/>In a horror game, the player getting freaked out at the imaginary scenario is, for most people, fun and exciting in and of itself. There's a part of our brain that loves getting the crap scared out of us, for some reason. I can't imagine why genetics wants to reward that behavior, but c'est la vie. <br/><br/>In Man v. Nature though the real obstacle is what? Frustration? Hopelessness? Depression and Rage? I feel like there is a delicate line between getting the player to connect with their character's frustration and <i>frustrating the player.</i> As the chief agenda at any table is the fun of the participants, I wonder how the balance between the two could be handled.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428888/#Comment_428888" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T09:02:32+00:00" title="February 27, 2014  9:02AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (NB:- We're using vs Nature a little atypically here. Technically almost every fantasy RPG has strong vs Nature elements. Going to a dungeon and killing an Owlbear, or wandering Mirkwood killing Giant Spiders is technically vs nature conflict. I'm using it in this post and above as it's been used here. To represent a conflict with nature that's not just fighting monsters.)<br/><br/>I think escalation is a big key to controlling frustration. Look at <i>Leiningen vs the Ants</i> or <i>Gravity</i>. These are stories that are full of small triumphs. The characters can exult at the achievement of small survival goals even they don't solve the grander problem. In fact I'd say that both of those stories use the triumphs to ratchet up the tension. "Ok Leiningen, the moat stops the ants for awhile, but now they're building a bridge out of their own corpses. What do you do next." Burning Wheel does a great job of this, as do most "fail forward" games.  <br/><br/>As always the GM should watch the mood of the table. <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> offers a good example of the story throwing the character a bone in the form of Friday. Don't be afraid to use the help to ratchet up the tension at the same time that you're using it to relieve frustration. <i>Gravity</i> does a good job of this in several places. <br/><br/>Making the characters responsible for NPCs is another method that can really help ratchet up the tension. Look at <i>Oregon Trail</i> as an example of this. Watching the settlers you're supposed to be responsible for die one by one can be a heart wrenching - and deeply rewarding- experience. <i>Gravity</i>, again, shows us this. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428896/#Comment_428896" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T12:13:14+00:00" title="February 27, 2014 12:13PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2014 12:13PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed w/ Crunch.  <br/><br/>Also, strategic coverage is key.

Much like skipping past the scary parts of a horror story, just because they don't happen to contain meaningful choices. Part of what makes a horror story scary is precisely the lack of agency, and the feeling of inevitability -- and the same is true of the particular subset of vs-nature stories we seem to be discussing. The more you gloss over those parts, the harder it may be to connect to those elements of the story, rather than focusing on the strategic choices at hand.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428907/#Comment_428907" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T15:13:10+00:00" title="February 27, 2014  3:13PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2014 3:21PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed, skipping past <i>all</i> the frustrating parts would suck.  In my example, I was going for an <i>extremely</i> frustrating part -- you see that all your most recent struggles are for naught.  The decision then is not strategic at all, but rather the kind of decision a disempowered horror protagonist faces -- succumb to the inevitable <i>now</i>, or strive on.<br/><br/>Perhaps the key is that "all your struggles are for naught" should arrive after <i>some</i> actual struggle on the <i>player's</i> part, rather than a mere summary of the <i>character's</i> struggle.  But I don't think that struggle needs to chew up hours of play time to make "and, you accomplished: nothing!" resonate.<br/><br/>I wonder if that suggests a rules approach -- small-scale stuff the players can triumph over with effort, plus large-scale stuff that dwarfs that.  Strategic play gets you a patch of planted vegetables, and then a random die roll for an early cold snap wipes the patch out.<br/><br/>It might be good to add some level of player fun on top, though, so "Does my character keep trying?" isn't <i>completely</i> synonymous with "How much more of this #*<a href="/forums/profile/%26amp">@&amp;</a>;ing game can I take?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428914/#Comment_428914" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T20:09:15+00:00" title="February 27, 2014  8:09PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You mean like single-roll efforts versus full conflicts in fucking Mouse Guard?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428915/#Comment_428915" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T21:54:37+00:00" title="February 27, 2014  9:54PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 27, 2014 10:16PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No.  Not remotely.  If you think my idea of <i>important stuff happening to the player/character with zero input from them</i> doesn't sound fun, well, you might be right, and I'm sure you'd prefer to play Mouse Guard instead.  But Mouse Guard's type of agency (not to mention Let it Ride) is completely opposite from the approach I was pondering.  <br/><br/>I guess the Mouse Guard equivalent of my idea would be "on the GM turn, the players don't get any rolls".  Or maybe when you do an MG conflict, you play all the way to the end where you establish what stakes and compromises you'll get, but then before that comes to pass, you flip a coin.  If it's tails, Nature renders the whole thing irrelevant, and you get 0% of your stakes.  That seems off-point for combats, chases, and social conflicts, though -- the conflict would need to be against The Cold or Being Lost or something in order for that to work.<br/><br/>This, of course, sounds awful if you're there to play Mouse Guard.  But if you're there to simulate the struggle vs Nature in all its unpredictable and impartial might, and you're prepared to embrace those moments of hopeless frustration as tests of character resolve, it might be kinda cool.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428916/#Comment_428916" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-27T23:41:10+00:00" title="February 27, 2014 11:41PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see.

           Oh, yeah, I'm not saying nature in Mouse Guard has, like, weak stats or something.  It can definitely be a formidable foe!  I just found that play was mostly about other things, and also that fighting a disease <i>felt</i> fairly similar to tackling other large-scale problems like weasel incursions or failing Guard leadership or whatever.  <br/><br/>But that's just one campaign with one group.  If you've experienced distinctively nature-heavy play, cool.<br/><br/>I'd still give my bizarre "flip a coin to lose the fruits of your labor" idea a shot, though.  (Or something like it but better.)  Maybe the right mindset could make that fun, maybe not.  Would we celebrate the little victories all the more, knowing they might be both fleeting and all we get?
