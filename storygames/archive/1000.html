                    I watched "Galaxy Quest" again this weekend and was struck with the potential for a game behind the concept of the line between actors and their roles.  This blurred with an idea I had sometime ago about a Road Movie LARP starring 70's actors amalgamated with their roles.  I ended up here.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone picks a character from a (Sci Fi) movie/television show.  Stat that character.  Then stat the ACTOR who plays the character - with a catch.  The more potent the CHARACTER is, the less capable the ACTOR is and vice-versa.  <br/>
<br/>
Play centers around a Galaxy Quest-like premise.  It turns out the world is stranger than you knew and it is actually plausible your characters/movies/shows could have happened (though they didn't - or maybe they did and you don't know it).  [In this last thought, it reminds me of Bubba Hotep, but that's an aside for another time.]<br/>
<br/>
If a player embraces the CHARACTER, they can draw on the attributes of that character though at the sacrifice of their relationships (and possibly their grip on 'reality').  If a player embraces the ACTOR, they can draw on the attributes of that actor, building relationships which should have some overall advantages.<br/>
<br/>
When the story is over, each actor/character is evaluated as to what degree they embraced the character or reality and thier epilogue is shared.<br/>
<br/>
Optimally, I would love to see this as a Live Action short of thing, possibly something that could be run during a larger social event (not unlike how I imagine the How To Run A Mystery games which I've not actually ever experienced).<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts??                </div>

                            The game you want to look at for this is "It Came From The Late Late Late Show" which does a lot of what you're describing, except that the source material is really bad, really cheap movies rather than popular, high-budget TV.                        </div>

In many ways, tabletop is easier.  (Computer RPG even easier.)<br/>
<br/>
Conceptually, I see a sliding scale of "belief" that places you somewhere between the two "anchors" (CHARACTER vs. ACTOR) on each trait.  So hypothetically, you do the math and set the values at each point in the scale prior to play.<br/>
<br/>
Belief shifts during play based on how the person acts - possibly with callouts or token awards from your fellow players.  Ditto relationships.  I had this vision of white poker chips with character initials or identifiers on them, that players passed to each other as they felt the relationships progressed in a positive manner.<br/>
<br/>
The sliding scale would not work so well in LARP (though I suppose on could predesign a mini-char sheet with a big paperclip), but the chip thing seems like it would translate either way well.<br/>
<br/>
Others - I would be interested in hearing more about the "how" of other games.  That is, what do those other games do similarly and, at a high overview, how they accomplish it.                        </div>

                            This is really interesting. In my novel City of Masks, which I'm currently writing a storygame for, the whole setting's premise is a city where it is official religious dogma that the masks that everyone wears are "real" (known as "Characterism"). There is an opposing heresy ("Personalism") that says the masks aren't real, the people wearing the masks are real.<br/><br/>Fun to see the same sort of idea approached from a different angle.                        </div>

                            I think that the larger issue is that you aren't adding a second layer, you are adding a third. The reason that most of these (like Dream Park and Hong Kong Action Theatre) largely failed is that few of us can play the two roles (or see the two roles we already play, adding a third just makes a huge morass.<br/><br/>I think that we are always playing ourselves -- without exception. As much as we attempt to divorce ourseves from 'reality' in roleplaying (or immersionists do anyway); we are either being stylized pictures of ourselves, or playing some element of ourselves. On rarer occassions people even play negatives of themselves, but always themselves.<br/><br/>If you are yourself, and you are playing a character, who is playing a character the issue is three games, not two. So if you can integrate your players AS THE metagame characters then the idea can be successful. Aside from that I wonder.                        </div>

                            I think this type of play is possible, but I agree that it is difficult -- it's not something I'd want to try in a one-shot sort of situation, for example, at least not without a lot of practice and (this is crucial) help from the system.<br/>
<br/>
I think the actor-playing-actor-playing-role thing is maybe making it look harder than it is. I imagine many of us have played characters who were deceitful -- who 'acted' fairly regularly in a circumstantial way in order to get what they want. Beyond that, many people have probably played characters who were infiltrators or spies, or undercover cops; who more deliberately took on a role in order to get something done. The play being described just seems to be an extension of that. Maybe a very significant one, but not a difference in kind.<br/>
<br/>
I think a good question is how a system could support players in keeping these things organized -- to keep from just falling into playing a purposeless, rather than a purposeful, amalgam of all the roles. When we have only the actor (player) and the role, we use things like character sheets and funny voices and different settings to help make it clear where the player is standing at any given moment (and to help us notice, either to appreciate or excoriate, when somebody is blurring that line.) Having different stats for the actor and the role seems like it follows that logic, but maybe there needs to be more cues beyond just which stats the player chooses to roll.                        </div>

                            ICFTLLLS had a system whereby your "Actor" had a sheet, and then on the back there was space for "Roles".  You'd put any temporary benefits that accrued from the role (one prop and "coaching" in one skill) in a Role space.  This would record what movies the actor had been in, how many fame points he had accrued in each one, and what the outcome was.                        </div>

                            That gives me the impression that the "Actor" is considered the primary PC, and the "Roles" are more like traits/stats for the Actor. Is that the case?                        </div>

                            Yeah, wouldn't that always be true for "three tier" roleplaying?                        </div>

                            My understanding of the OP is that he was thinking of a game where whether the Actor or the Role was 'the PC' was constantly in tension, and the Player made decisions that would make one or the other more primary over the course of the game. It's not clear if this is actually a three-tier situation rather than a 'lightside/darkside' set up, but my impression was that the Actor would actually be the one deciding whether or not to embrace their Role or to embrace the person they actually are (with the player making decisions based on their psychological understanding of the Actor.) But the tension would come from the possibility that the Role could take over the Actor, and in order to have that tension mechanically I think you need to have both the Actor and Role on equal footing (for example, both of them having full character sheets).<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I could be totally out to lunch about what was intended. I was imagining something like a scenario where an undercover cop spends so much time acting like a drug dealer that eventually the line blurs as to whether he is a cop at all -- his persona is so important to his survival that it becomes primary to who he is. Similarly, you could have a villain who spends so long acting like a good guy to fool those around him -- drawing frequently on 'good guy' traits that only his persona truly possesses -- that he starts purposefully foiling his own evil schemes. Etc. etc. I'm not sure if this is what happens in Galaxy Quest, since I haven't seen it -- it sounds like there's less emphasis on the two roles being at odds with each other -- but it seems like the idea is to have the abilities of the Role be so compelling/tempting that the Actor is motivated to give up their actual personality in favour of the Role.<br/>
<br/>
To what degree these scenarios require a three-tier division is not totally clear.                        </div>

                            I'm currently adding a mechanic to my <a href="http://www.csidemedia.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/COM/PlayingTheGameOfMasks" rel="nofollow">City of Masks game</a> to explicity create conflict between the mask (which is the Role) and the avatar (which is the Actor). I call it "Hidden Face". It's directly inspired by the "thematic battery" idea in Full Light, Full Steam. <br/><br/>Because my setting is a city in which everyone wears masks at all times, and includes a kind of religious struggle between "Characterists" (who insist that the mask is what is real) and "Personalists" (who insist that the person wearing the mask is real), this conflict is directly relevant to the theme.<br/><br/>As I write it's only starting to be integrated into the text. I think it needs to be more useful to the player than I have so far made it.                        </div>
