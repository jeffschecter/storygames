It's got a simple, card-driven mechanic and it's aimed principally at the sorts of people who enjoy Sam Raimi/Wes Craven style horror movies in spite of (or perhaps partly because of) finding them utterly predictable in certain respects. THE BLACK SPOT is its working title.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it might actually be rather fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there's anyone here who'd be willing to have a look over the rules and offer any comments or suggestions that might come to mind, would you be so kind as to whisper me your e-mail address?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chuck%20Henebry" title="Chuck Henebry"><img alt="Chuck Henebry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chuck%20Henebry">Chuck Henebry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233453/#Comment_233453" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T11:07:09+00:00" title="September 21, 2009 11:07AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Would love to help you out on this. Is this something you\u2019re submitting to Iron Game Chef? I have something of my own that I\u2019m putting together for that, so I\u2019d actually be interested in an exchange of prisoners, I mean game drafts.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Off topic: your thread title put me in mind of Treasure Island, in which giving someone \u201cThe Black Spot\u201d is an accusation of wrongdoing among pirates. If you get the Black Spot, you\u2019ve not long to live.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
