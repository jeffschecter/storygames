It makes sense, since many of us are more excited about the color of a game (the imagined details and style of the imaginary world/fiction) than anything else.  Not even all of it, but just specific stuff to get ahold of.  <br/><br/>The examples from when this was talked about on the <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=27387.0" rel="nofollow">Forge</a> were mostly centered around finding specific images and riffing off of them to make characters and build setting for any particular game.  If you ever played Everway, it does this very specifically by giving you "vision cards"<br/><br/>Some might say this is just the 'concept' phase of character creation, and to an extent they're right.  But look, I teach visual art students all the time.  Most of us think in generalities.  It's what keeps us from having to make a new mental file for every car and truck we ever see.  It is why artists train by drawing from a live model.  No matter how good your mental model of something is, nature still surprises you with its specificity. Color first is about finding a specific vision that brings things to life in the game.<br/><br/>I pretty much do this for characters all the time, now.  Looking for images and then riffing of the specifics of an image or a few images to make a character gives me some great stuff.  I ask myself cool questions like "why do they have that," or "why are they wearing that, or "why is that expression on their face."<br/><br/>You know how AW asks you to define your look/outlook up front and gives you the specific lists of names and bodies and eyes?  That's very much color first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417758/#Comment_417758" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-04T05:44:27+00:00" title="July  4, 2013  5:44AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Trevis: Thanks for that.<br/><br/>My own personal never-quite finished project has been about using miniatures with more of a story-game mentality, and that color-first approach has been one of the things I try to emphasize.<br/><br/>It's a really hard idea to get across, the concept of using those as a starting image, and then building out from there as an early step of either character or scenario/situation creation.<br/><br/>Like, absurdly, tear out your hair and cry, hard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417775/#Comment_417775" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-04T13:15:59+00:00" title="July  4, 2013  1:15PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is the future of game design, actually.

Look at the <a href="http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Peasant_Railgun" rel="nofollow">Peasant Railgun</a> for instance.<br/><br/>And how many of us actually use ALL of these rules in a session, or even a whole campaign? If you'd take a time to write down how many rules of a trad game you actually use all the time and include your own home rules, that would probably be in the best case, one-third of the original core book.<br/><br/>Yet there are still too many games going this way somehow, thankfully less and less every year, since in the end, when we get to the table, all that matters are the things that happen, and the details and argumentation of how they happen will be remembered like the time you spent cheking your character sheet and adding bonuses to your dice roll to do something. Dunno about you, whenever I remember a good game, I remember most fondly the story, the characters for what they did and how good or poor rolls made things more epic, hilarious or dramatic. When I recall a bad one, it was mostly for a stupid discussion about nonsensic rules or their application.<br/><br/>Rules for physics are boring, we already know how physics work in the real world and it's easy to come to an agreement about those. Rules and proceedings to create better stories, to convey color, are not so well known. We learn them by consuming fiction but then again, anot all players are accomplised writers and actors, so anything that helps players produce high quality fiction of any genre is the future, IMHO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417808/#Comment_417808" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-05T09:59:30+00:00" title="July  5, 2013  9:59AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 5, 2013 10:27AM by komradebob.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The example of the peasant railgun parallels an argument in some very nerdy wargamer circles, usually called Bottom Up vs Top Down Design.<br/><br/>Unshockingly, early RPGs, descended from experiments with single character wargames, flow from Bottom Up wargame designs, and tend to have some of the same fail points.<br/><br/>I'm not quite as optimistic that color-first is the future, although I hope it gets explored more.

Take for example your usual trad <a href="http://www.waynesbooks.com/Aliens.html" rel="nofollow">"Aliens (Colonial Marines) RPG"</a> which features detailed stats for vehicles, weapons and aliens and compare it with<a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-regiment-colonial-marines.html" rel="nofollow"> this hack of the Regiment for Colonial Marines</a>. Which one delivers color the best? The former which just give you the physics of the world or the later which adds procedures (Moves) to help flesh out the character's actions in the same world?<br/><br/>Dunno about you but for some reason the later is yelling me "Play Me NOW!", while the trad one makes my brain say "You'd have to hack this into 1/10 of it's original size before before even thinking of prepping a one-shot session for it" For all that comes to getting more and new fans into the hobby, that's all that matters: how you make them feel and how fast you can deliver it. And getting more people interested in RPGs is what I think it's of the future of the whole business, or we are doomed.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417818/#Comment_417818" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-05T14:22:06+00:00" title="July  5, 2013  2:22PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a pretty easy sell on color-first approaches.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417824/#Comment_417824" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-05T15:09:04+00:00" title="July  5, 2013  3:09PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ^_^ me too, I didn't get the whole AW feeling until I saw this Regiment Hack.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417838/#Comment_417838" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-05T22:59:50+00:00" title="July  5, 2013 10:59PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, personally, I'm with you guys in terms of taste, but I've definitely seen instances of detailed fictional measurement and physics rules providing great fun and utility to a group.

If so, it's no different than an Iron Will D&amp;D feat.  If not, it's straight metagame, no fictional causality involved.

Just on the grounds of trying something different, I favor the other for a bit. I mean, I can always go buy one of the zillion or so numeric simulation based games that already exist.<br/><br/>Which audience is bigger? Again, hard to say. After all, design has been dominated by numeric simulation to the extent that no one knows much about any other reaction or if there even is an audience.<br/><br/>I mean, we know that there are folks like the numeric simulation approach and they constantly demand more of the same. We see it every time one the old "that's not an RPG!" arguments pops up on RPGnet or elsewhere.<br/><br/>We know that people have tried numeric simulation based games and not liked them. We can only posit that they would like some other approach, like color first. It <i>might</i> be true, or it might be a fool's errand and there is no other commercially viable audience outside of numeric simulation lovers. <br/><br/>There are hints that people might like other approaches ( the existence of freeformers of all sorts and various hippy Scandinavian design fans), but that commercially viable part is kind of a big deal. It's a big deal not just from a money-making standpoint, but also from an idea-transferal standpoint. People discuss stuff they pay for more and ponder more on tweaking mechanics and approaches related to it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417883/#Comment_417883" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-06T16:19:42+00:00" title="July  6, 2013  4:19PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>I'm not 100% sure I follow you on the Spiritual Attributes being "straight metagame". Can you give an example, maybe, of what that looks like in play? (And how that's different than a group applying, say, a "close range" bonus in a similar way.)<br/><br/>As for using non-physics-based mechanics in a color-first, immersive game, what are your thoughts on Sign In Stranger?

Color-first rocks!  My points above were mainly in response to an assertion that it could replace physics-sim.  <i>Sign in Stranger</i> is <i>completely</i> unconcerned with all the aspects of play that physics-modeling aims to support.<br/><br/>As for <i>Riddle of Steel</i> Spiritual Attributes, if no one bothers to say "my character is charged up and puts out this amazing effort!" then all you're left with is, "this opponent is a better fighter and should mop the floor with me, so I will cross some points off my character sheet and take bonus dice (or whatever it is), and now suddenly my superior opponent is toast".  Or, if the player does say "charged up for amazing effort!" but narrates it weakly and someone else at the table just can't parse what's happening, or doesn't buy that a fighter motivated by his sister's honor (or whatever) fights better than an opponent who's simply trying to kill and not be killed (arguably the strongest motivation there is)... this can also seem pretty bogus to folks who like their fictional causality.<br/><br/>But if everyone buys the "strong motive!" logic and can see how it applies in a given instance, then the bonus dice seem to be representing the fiction instead of just being a pure numeric system input from without, and fictional causality is maintained.<br/><br/>I think this is a great example, because I run into moments like this all the time -- where I see someone look at a sheet and invoke a mechanic that makes me go "Wait, what just changed in the fiction?", and then I can either grimace and move on, or try to find a way to translate the metagame causality into fictional causality.  I know some players who care about fictional causality who refuse to do one or both of these, and simply object.  Much as that's disruptive, I definitely sympathize.\n<blockquote>I mean, we know that there are folks like the numeric simulation approach and they constantly demand more of the same.

I'm just saying, if I had to bet money, I'd put it on the audience that's proven to exist rather than the audience that may or may not.<br/><br/>I think the basic appeal of numeric simulation is the promise of a fair and predictable arbiter of fictional ad-lib.  Whether a given sim game <i>delivers</i> on that promise is another matter, but I think <i>lots</i> of players get twitchy without it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417946/#Comment_417946" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-08T08:22:04+00:00" title="July  8, 2013  8:22AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes sense, Dave.

Just like we can say, "Hey, you're fighting from horseback, so don't forget your +1 Horse Rider bonus," it can be interesting just to see that the guy who's fighting for his sister's honour tends to win more fights, after the fact. But that requires us to be on the same page concerning what the game's about, of course. If that connection is too opaque, it sounds like a badly-designed game to me.

Both are usual for trad games, though one shouldn't imply the other. I'm against detailed physics rules because designers are human, not gods and so they can't think of every detail of how their world should work. When they try, things like the peasant railgun happen. These are things that however cool or hilaious as they can be, breake the fourth wall into a different form of fun. And also, introduce way too much rules into a game that most of the time doesn't need them. <br/><br/>Numerical simulation on the other hand is meant to be a fair and predictable arbiter as Dave says. Without it you'd have to fall back to some sort of argumentation (which could take forever) or other procedures like as ritual phrases, to overcome disagreements. Which is faster and more fun? Pile one argument after another until we resolve who hit first or roll the dice to fund out? Dunno about you, but I'll pick the later any day.<br/><br/>On top of that there are systems and procedures that however simple and intuitive may look to the designer, won't work with all groups of players or GMs. It's really useful to know now that Riddle of steel's Spiritual Attributes doesn't always work (thanks a lot for that, Dave) I haven't played the game but when I readed similar mechanics in other games and understood how it worked I thought they would do it fine. I'm wondering now if Fate's Aspects suffer the same problem and how. For me the thing about Aspects is that the core book should actually provide a good list of them instead of examples. I've always felt lost when thinking how should I create a character in that system.<br/><br/>However I did used Aspects in a more limited way for another game I hacked, providing a list for the players to choose from, and it did really good. Not that I found a way to stop players from pushing that button (nor tried to), but compelling aspects worked just fine.<br/><br/>I've never got the gist of stats for AW neither, it also looks to me like they don't do much in the game, except at first, to get an idea of what kind of character you are making.<br/><br/>Anyway, I still think color first games are the future because it's a lot easier to sell the game from there than presenting a numerical simulation and hoping buyers will see the possibilities. The future is in the poeple who hasn't played an RPG and still doesn't know how fun it is. The lower to put the bar for them, the better, and right now that bar is "amount of rules you need to know to play this" and "how much creatively extrovert you need to be to play this"<br/><br/>The people who already love RPGs won't need new games; some of us are still playing AD&amp;D or 3.5. I've got PF and I'm happy with it, I don't need 4th or Next. Sure, I can try something else out of curiosity but AH! that makes me a different type of consumer, right? The one who tries things out of curiosity, and there's more of those than hardcore or casual RPG players. AND between those I'm sure there are more hardcore gamers awaiting to be awaken...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417974/#Comment_417974" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-08T14:24:22+00:00" title="July  8, 2013  2:24PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2013 2:27PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, it's true, I'm mentioning the problematic case where the rules adjustment is visible and the fictional explanation isn't implicit.  There are plenty of other cases.  It's pretty normal that (a) no one notices the extra dice and thus no one asks "where did that come from?", or (b) everyone imagines "where that came from" in a way that works for them, with no communication required.<br/><br/>W-Monk, I think numeric representation doesn't really become "simulation" until physics enters the equation.  Example:<br/><br/>I'm atop a small staircase, fighting a badguy who's completely encased in magical armor which cannot be cut, but which doesn't do much to blunt the force of bludgeons, and is also very bulky and heavy heavy.  I'm getting my ass kicked, but my back is to a wall, while his back is to the stairs.  I'm imagining the situation, tackling it with all the cleverness I can muster, and I have an idea.  "I'm going to push him down the stairs!  If I can just force him back an inch, his giant boots should give trouble finding purchase on the narrow stairs.  If I hit him above his center of gravity, he should be leaning back when he loses his footing.  If he then falls, the armor should provide no protection against the injuries from repeated impacts of tumbling.  He should wind up a crumpled heap, struggling to get up under the weight of his own armor, and I can then walk up and slit his throat.  I'm a genius!  Now let's see if I can pull it off..."<br/><br/>My inspiration is based on physics, so I need a physics-based rule set to reward me for its specifics.  Each bonus to damage or penalty to a balance check or whatever is a reward for my cleverness.  A game whose numeric quantities are broader and based on something other than physics, like "acting With A Plan gives you +1", does not offer the same rewards.  A lot of narrative-first games will say something like "succeed and inflict a fictionally applicable Condition from the list".  So the plan above would mean I can hope to inflict the condition "stunned" on Big Armor Guy.  If that's good enough for me, great, I can use a simple rule set that doesn't concern itself with things like inertia, balance, force and distance.  But sometimes that's not good enough.  "Wait, I can also inflict the Stunned condition just by kicking him in the balls?  Okay, so my brilliant idea was worth nothing."<br/><br/>As for tapping an untapped market by offering games that don't force players to wrestle with physics and look up all sorts of detailed special cases, I certainly hope you're right!  I think having a crunchy system wherein the player can deal more with rules than with other players is actually a solution to the creative extrovert barrier, and I've heard that D&amp;D at big cons is a lot of rolling without talking.

I think games like Fiasco attract very different people than games like D&amp;D4E. Neither "needs" or wants the advantages of the other game.<br/><br/>That said, I don't how unusual we are for being willing to try all kinds of games and try to enjoy them on their own merits.<br/><br/>As far as physics modeling, and Dave's armoured guy example:<br/><br/>Dave, how much of this is a question of proper "modeling" and how much of it is a question of how the players will use the rules when they're actually in the middle of the game? For instance, as far as I know, your game Delve does very little to "model" physics, and yet it's designed precisely for this kind of "clever ploy which must be plausible to succeed"-style-of-gaming. Similarly, it seems to me that super old-school D&amp;D (aka "rulings, not rules") encourages this kind of approach much more than more recent editions of the game, which seek to codify more effects into modifiers and limitations.<br/><br/>I've always enjoyed the "roll dice to slap your opponent with a Condition" style of play the most when the group is conscientious about applying the rules in a way which suits their creative vision and not allowing player input to break the illusion of a consistent fiction. So for instance, a group which says things like, "No, you can't just kick him in the balls. He's wearing heavy-duty armour. What are you going to do instead? If you want to inflict a Condition on him, you've got to come up with a way to do so which is plausible."<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard comes to mind here: although the system doesn't weight certain options over others (e.g. your "big gun" is always worth three dice, even if in *this* situation it shouldn't really make a huge difference), the idea of the group consensus editing Trait use seems like it works very well with the right group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417982/#Comment_417982" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-08T16:07:43+00:00" title="July  8, 2013  4:07PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 8, 2013 4:16PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Delve</i> hands the physics problem to the group and gives them the tools to arbitrate it themselves.  It works, but it doesn't offer the same reassurance to a new player that pages of codification does.  <i>Delve</i> acknowledges that you are at the mercy of the group, and doesn't offer rules mastery as a way out of that.  I imagine this limits my audience significantly.<br/><br/>Numeric physics-modeling covers the case of "we know you care about this but can't be trusted to work it out for yourselves", just like when you roll dice for success or failure rather than letting someone decide.  (I'm <i>not</i> saying that's <i>all</i> these approaches do!  Just pointing out that it's one important function.)<br/><br/>As for <i>Dogs</i>, I suppose the right group could apply a high fictional-causality threshold to <i>any</i> mechanic, but in practice, I've seen <i>Dogs</i> players shoehorn in a lot of crap where the obvious cause was "it's on my sheet and I get dice for it".  You did this with your "the youth speaks true" trait when it was a really poor fit for the situation, despite the fact that you're happy to let the fiction lead in other contexts.

If you look at a Pathfinder sheet, it's clear that you can hit people with your weapons and appraise gems and resist petrification, and high numbers mean you're good at it and low numbers mean you're bad at it, and your hit points track how long you can keep at it before you might die.

Dunno about you, but I'll pick the later any day.</blockquote>\nNot sure what mechanics you're thinking of, but I have played Archipelago, Matrix Games, and Mythic GM Emulator. <br/><br/>None of those have much in the way of numeric/physics sim and none of them have become endless debates or argument piling to get through the game.<br/><br/>Edit:<br/>I feel like I should explain that a bit more actually.<br/><br/>Part of how it work is that you just plain come in with a different mentality.<br/><br/>Even with numeric sim, we don't roll for everything, right?<br/><br/>With these other approaches* a couple of things are going on:<br/>We're using those mechanics only at times and places when someone involved thinks there is either a problem in narration or when there's seen to be an interesting point of possible divergence.<br/><br/>In playing these games, players tend to come in with the mentality that moving things along is actually more important than grinding to a halt to dissect things.<br/><br/>Players are more willing to accept input and move on, as these don't tend to be about winning in-fiction as much. Challenge here is more like: <i>You've engaged the mechanics and it turned out differently than you expected. Are you capable of rolling with that and continuing to play?</i> If the answer becomes "No!", that's your lose condition, not what just happened in the fiction.<br/><br/>They tend to be fast set up and fast play. There's little in the way of mechanics, most of them can be explained and described in everyday language, and they tend to be universal in application. This last one is kinda important if fairness is actually important to you. It means that anyone can play the game, not just people who have don a huge amount of homework and no one is getting advantaged or disadvantaged by those things.<br/><br/>They work rally well when you accept them from the POV that the rules/mechanics are going to be refining and re-inforcing what the group believes to be true and it will develop over the course of the game. In contrast to the more numeric or physiques sim, this is something that happens at the table rather than at the designer's computer.<br/><br/>Is this good or bad? Truth be told, the group at the table or the designer might actually create something wildly off-mark based on their own understanding and biases. If it happens at the table however, you're dealing with it at the moment and with the face to face people you are gaming with, which has benefits.<br/><br/>Sometimes designers can be wrong too, no matter what they think they know. I'm sure that if we went back and looked at some of those very intricate naval wargames that existed even in the 1930s, we'd find designers telling us there was no way under the sun that HMS Hood could be one-shotted by a single 15 inch shell.<br/><br/><br/>*Matrix Games being a bit different here because argumentation is part of the fun (at least in earlier versions of those mechanics) and is largely meant to be in the service of <i>better quality </i>simulation. Early uses of Matrix Game rules also tended to be more PvP oriented.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418021/#Comment_418021" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-09T07:48:26+00:00" title="July  9, 2013  7:48AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>Yes, I see.

If we put your example through the <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/indexes/combat.htm" rel="nofollow">system</a>\n<blockquote><br/>I'm atop a small staircase, fighting a badguy who's completely encased in magical armor which cannot be cut, but which doesn't do much to blunt the force of bludgeons, and is also very bulky and heavy heavy.  I'm getting my ass kicked, but my back is to a wall, while his back is to the stairs.  I'm imagining the situation, tackling it with all the cleverness I can muster, and I have an idea.  "I'm going to push him down the stairs!  If I can just force him back an inch, his giant boots should give trouble finding purchase on the narrow stairs.  If I hit him above his center of gravity, he should be leaning back when he loses his footing.  If he then falls, the armor should provide no protection against the injuries from repeated impacts of tumbling.  He should wind up a crumpled heap, struggling to get up under the weight of his own armor, and I can then walk up and slit his throat.  I'm a genius!  Now let's see if I can pull it off..."<br/></blockquote>\nThat would mean you're attempting to either Bull Rush or Trip (Overrun may apply too,I think) your opponent, so he gets an Attack of Opportunity (unless you know your feats and have Improved Bull Rush / Improved Trip among them) and then you both roll the dice and add strenght or dex depending on which one you're trying. You are against the wall so you can't have a +2 for charging, but you have +1 for holding the higher ground. Perhaps your opponent should roll balance after you bull rush him or a reflex to avoid most of the damage. Oh, and then your opponent would be<i> Prone</i>. It already took me eight minutes to figure out how this works ruleswise, which in game time is forever. I concede that I'm not familiar enough with the system to know this instinctively, even though I have played four campaings with it (well, I never had to GM nor I'll ever dream about it, it's just way too detailed for me. If I was GMing you, I'd say "Excellent idea! roll for it, you get a +1/your opponent gets a -1 to keep its balance, etc." And if you failed, you could probably get that attack of opportunity in the face. <br/><br/>My point is that you don't need rules that generate their own physics, you need a more loose and general ruleset that allows you to apply common sense physics. Numerical simulation for this is all right, I'm not against numerical simulation, like you I'm just against <i>rules that block my creativity.</i><br/>So I don't really consider that rule you mentioned about<i> roll the dice and apply X condition</i> any different if it blocks creativity. It's just another sort of fake and sad physics emulation, even if it's in a story-oriented indie game. And please, don't start saying "It's all about rules interpretation" and "using common sense while GMing" because then we'll be back to the Rule Zero issue, which is the reason that made a lot of us go into indie games.<br/><br/>Now, why do I bother to mention this trad game as a example, when games currently being designed are supposedly over this? Because (for the sake of appealing to the players who already love RPGs as they are) we keep coming back to design decissions made specifically for this game. On top of that, designers obsessed with flaws in trad games often go to the far opposite side making more mistakes in the way.

There's absolutely nothing bad with the games we've been playing, except that they won't convince a wider audience.

The Shadowrun character has stats reflecting interest in Elvish wines, Japanese culture, and modern jazz (for example) - as well as Etiquette and Fast-talk.  The Apocalypse World character has its first move that matches your point, but then has its other moves like "<i>Knife in the dark: when you attack from hiding or from a circumstance prepared by you in advance, your harm is armor piercing.</i>"  <br/><br/>It seems to me, though, that "<i>Knife in the dark</i>" is colorful, and likewise acrobatics and hardware and physics can be colorful.  Physics and technology might not be human drama, but it can be colorful and cool.  </blockquote>\nBesides the conspiracy that the "color" game promotes if you have a player picking the covert ops playbook (the Intrigue! move), you also have the initial Hx stablishing that the other players dont trust you, you have the Slippery and the Paints something move that makes it hard for other players to read the character and to hold forwards against him. And to finish, if you fuck (literally) with another player character, it counts as manipulating them with a 10+ roll. (there was also a Sabotage move that the author, sadly, didnt put in the final version, which allowed the character to sabotage things and blame other players).<br/><br/>In resume: the "color" covert ops is all about injecting interesting situations and conflicts into the fiction that are apropriated to the spy genre while directly envolving the other players. While the "numbers" covert ops is all about passive numbers that are there to simulate capacities from agents of the spy genre and thats it.<br/><br/>Do you agree that there is a distinction in focus, system-wise ? <br/><br/>I may be not using the best words though (Im not a native speaker). Maybe "color-first" is not the best term to label the first covert ops. Maybe "fiction-first" is more apropriated.

After GURPS went through so much effort to fairly codify every physical situation, and the results <i>still</i> wound up rewarding system mastery more than fiction-based creativity, I think many designers were eager to flee that trap entirely.  "Let's stop worrying about whether position and balance and armor weight really make a difference, and roll for Determination or Vengeance or other good character-in-a-story stuff instead!"  And yeah, rolling for Vengeance is fun, but it doesn't scratch the same itch that GURPS was aimed at.<br/><br/>So now I'm curious what you'd think about my game.  In <i>Delve</i>, fiction-based creativity is supported as follows:<br/><br/>1) Although the "what" of the game is adventuring and puzzles and demons, the "how" is presented right up front too.  Part of the pitch is "immersion in being there, seeing the fiction through your character's eyes, tackling it with the tools at their disposal".<br/><br/>2) The rule for arbitrating in-game stuff starts with the fiction.  "If it wouldn't work, it doesn't.  If it would work, it does."  There are no game quantities that factor into this.  There is no GM prerogative either.  It's up to the group to agree on what's plausible.  I've developed some dialogue techniques for forming this agreement in a satisfying and efficient manner.  See <a href="http://www.shrikedesign.com/games/delve/resolution.html" rel="nofollow">these comics for learning and trouble-shooting</a>, but once you get used to it, it's much quicker and smoother.<br/><br/>3) When the group agrees that something <i>might or might not work</i>, and roughly how likely/difficult it is, a target number is chosen from the range of Nearly Guaranteed (3) to Nearly Impossible (12).  Any relevant ways in which the character is above or below average are then added to a 2d6 die roll.  I continue to mess around with the specifics of this, but here's the relevant portion for our present topic:  You only roll if the group agrees that this could go either way and the difference is worth focusing on.  A die roll is not a right given to you by any items on your character sheet; in fact, most of the stuff listed on your sheet defines things you simply can or can't do.  Only on edge cases should you expect to roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418055/#Comment_418055" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-09T19:09:35+00:00" title="July  9, 2013  7:09PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing that's worth noting about very un-granular but very fiction-first games like AW: <i>how</i> you describe what you're doing does matter, a great deal even, but not in terms of your probability of success/failure(/partial success).

A lot of "roll Vengeance"-type games can be played with a strong connection to the fiction, simply because they return certain at-the-table results (e.g. "player B narrates a difficult failure", or "group decides on most plausible way for the situation to go as well as possible"). Same goes for "stake-setting" games, where the group must negotiate a plausible good outcome and a plausible bad outcome. <br/><br/>The only things I see that process missing for the "idealized GURPS play" Dave is discussing are:<br/><br/>1. The "right" to have your clever plan guaranteed a certain chance of success by the "physics" of the game engine. In other words, even if the other players don't agree with you, you have a chance to see your plan succeed because it's <i>just that smart</i>. This is how it "works" in real life after all, right? You have an audacious plan which you just know is brilliant, but no one seems to see it the way you do. So you can put it into action and prove them wrong! But you can't do this in a system which is based on group consensus.<br/><br/>2. The ability to play "what if?", trying different things to see what would actually happen. Let's throw together this thing and that thing, and try something we've never seen anyone do before. We have no idea how it will turn out! What if you cast an Enlarge spell on a worm trapped in someone's stomach? I don't know, you don't know... we just want to find out! (I've only seen this work in games where those consequences have already been spelled out by a writer, and you can open the book and see what it say.)<br/><br/>Can you think of any others?<br/><br/>I can't think of any games which actually DO deliver those two things meaningfully, but I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't be stoked if someone made a game which actually <i>could</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418060/#Comment_418060" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-09T22:26:32+00:00" title="July  9, 2013 10:26PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2013 10:28PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, in response to your points:<br/><br/>1. This absolutely works for system mastery if the group abides by the rules.  You invent Peasant Railgun and feel brilliant.  For fictional causality, though, no; like you, I haven't seen that succeed.<br/><br/>2. Trying things to see what works is also a fun system exercise in many games.  I remember some D&amp;D2 economic tricks you could pull by transmuting stuff to gold, and the pace of Tunneling had some fun applications.  Cloud Kill + any container spell was badass.  And there's good ol' Web + Fireball.  The spell list was really where the "what if?" game was at in 2e.  The downside from a fictional causality perspective is that if stuff really worked this way in the gameworld, gold would be valueless and moles would rule the world.  So if you cared about plausibility, you eventually got tired of looking the other way.<br/><br/>I think you missed a big one:<br/><br/>3. <i>Measurable</i> bang for your creative contributions.  Regardless of whether your cool idea requires other players' consent, when it does get to make a difference in play, some players find "+1 for high ground and -1 to their reflex save" to be a more satisfying game experience than "hey, good call, I guess that works".<br/><br/>As for action narration as a fictional cause in AW, sometimes yes, sometimes no.  Sometimes, as GM, it's easiest just to pick a cool-sounding Hard Move and run with your own inspiration.  Your range of options is often quite broad, and working in a way to reward player cleverness can be extra work beyond what the game demands of you.  If you have a GM like Matt who cares, then no problem, but I don't think I ever got to be clever in Monsterhearts (which was awesome in other ways).<br/><br/>More broadly, I agree that <i>some</i> sort of strong connection to the fiction is present in all sorts of games, just as you mentioned.  My convention <i>Primetime Adventures</i> play has been very fiction- and color-first.  <i>Zero</i> fictional <i>causality</i>, though.  The inputs into <i>what happens</i> are Fan Mail points and entertainment value and the like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418061/#Comment_418061" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-09T22:43:26+00:00" title="July  9, 2013 10:43PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>the "color" covert ops is all about injecting interesting situations and conflicts into the fiction that are appropriate to the spy genre while directly involving the other players.</blockquote>I think a lot of people refer to that approach as "story first".<br/><br/>And I agree with you that the difference in system focus is huge!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418062/#Comment_418062" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-09T22:44:47+00:00" title="July  9, 2013 10:44PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 10, 2013 8:17AM by WarriorMonk.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave, I love the way you're using comics to explain the keywords/phrases in a more detailed way, this is something all roleplayers use but it isn't written in any rulebook at all. Most of us learned this by seeing more experienced players use it or the hard way by trial and error, to finally develop the tools to face the fiction and deal with the GM and other players in the most efficient way.<br/><br/>I love that the keywords you use are totally intuitive. I do use that phrases when I play but never stopped to think about it, this is exactly what I've been complaining that most rulebooks never do.<br/><br/>However there are a few traps in your text, most of this will only work well with a group of collaborative players and it looks like you're assuming these are the only kind of players that would be interested in playing your game. Let me point a few of these traps:<br/><br/>-Player's Assumptions are an easy to press button. You reccomendation "don't get in the habit of assuming too much" is insufficient to keep players from hitting this button, since it isn't phrased as a rule. Probably the GM will have to turn it into a rule and enforce this by his own if the group isn't in a totally cooperative mood. You see, there's no way to determine when a player will have a cooperative or a competitive mood, it may depend of circumstances outside the game, so I think it's safer to assume the worst case scenario when designing a game. A player may even act like she is being cooperative, but she may still subtly hit this button to get an advantage that might not look like too much at first, but will be decisive in a long term plan. And yes, assuming that the player might be smarter than the GM is also a safer path for a design.<br/><br/>-Stablishing Settings isn't bad, though I'd recommend having the GM show pics whenever he can. If you have designed specific looks for specific things in the setting, you'll be better actually showing them in the core book if you can make/afford the art. Just a thought.<br/><br/>-Complex decisions looks good at first glance, but it has small traps and assumptions you're making that might not be true for many groups of players. "Sounds Good?" isn't something all players ask, I've seen GMs and players cleverly evade this to avoid the GM or the group questioning. Works when the victim(s) are distracted or the perpetrator has skillfully make them focus on something else. It can easily go under your radar and/or if you're less strong-willed or more introvert than the perpetrator is waaay too easy to be dazzled by this and go with it, even when you feel you're walking into a trap. If the PCs are in the same team, they probably support the player doing this anyway, if it comes in their benefit too. Of course, if your group is entirely composed of cooperative players (meaning they also cooperate with the GM on making the challenges more difficult/fair) your system will work as expected.<br/><br/>-On the panel above the phrase "Does that seem likely?" it's clear that the GM actually has prerrogatives, though he has to get past player's final approval to fit them into the fiction, as you show next. It isn't the same as saying that <i>There is no GM prerogative</i>. So, what you have here is the GM also imposing some stuff on the settings so the players don't get off with it too easily, but doing it in a more subtle way, as players can do with assumptions, only that being the GM, he can indulge on making this an habit (since otherwise, the game would be too easy)<br/><br/>-<i>That was my mistake</i> is like Rule Zero, here giving the GM freedom to walk back in his steps and putting the bar higher. I'm not too sure this will do. Now when I look at the GM's character in the comic, it makes him look like a dick stealing the game from the players. I'm not saying this scenes doesn't happen, but it usually happen with things more important and logical than the height of a house, which suddenly gets higher to stop a player from doing something that could end an scene too quickly. (ok, perhaps he actually forgot, but it still looks like that wasn't the case)<br/><br/>-<i>Fuck it, I'll just do Y instead</i> finally makes this an example of what shouldn't happen. The player's expression says it all, he's clearly frustrated that they have been discussing this for five minutes only to get the GM and other player block and idea that could have ended up on a quite cinematic scene. He's dealing with it and going with the GM of course, the action continues, but those were 5 minutes of his life that won't come back, so at least this deserves some profanity. As a GM I'd have just gone with his plan, make him roll for the stunt and have him fall badly if he fumbled it. Or land on top of the chased if he had rolled a crit. Both things are still better than railroading him into going with the group, which is how the entire example feels up to this point.<br/><br/>-<i>Not plausible</i> is also, like the assumptions, like putting a blade in the hand of the players ready to use it against the GM. I know the idea of your game is having everyone cooperate on building a good experience, and thus this is a tool to keep the GM at bay in case the fictions gets over his head. But then again, you're not thinking into the worst case scenario from the other side. The first scene narrated by the GM before the "not plausible" interruption sounded like an amazing cue of how the supernatural abilities of the Demon are taking action, by creating an illusion that is, of course, not plausible but yet strong enough to distort the sense of reality of the PCs... and then somebody ruins it saying "not plausible" and reverting the world back to boring normal. Well, I dunno what the demons do in Delve's setting but now it sounds like the answer is "not so much"<br/><br/>-<i>Trust</i> isn't realistic at all, sorry. It's a good hope, but it's like wishing for world peace. Even stating it as a rule won't make players trust each other, even if they are old good friends. <i>Specially</i> if the are old good friends. You may think I'm being too cynical, well, perhaps I am. There are other people like me in the world and even though you may have a really interesting setting and a nice game, we probably won't be able to play this game as a totally cooperative group. Not a big deal, no game is made for everyone, but I still think that if you could tweak this just a bit, thinking of not even the worst, but just a bit worse case scenario, I'd buy it inmediatly. And you could add a lot of cynical people into your audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418064/#Comment_418064" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-09T23:19:16+00:00" title="July  9, 2013 11:19PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In resume: the "color" covert ops is all about injecting interesting situations and conflicts into the fiction that are apropriated to the spy genre while directly envolving the other players. While the "numbers" covert ops is all about passive numbers that are there to simulate capacities from agents of the spy genre and thats it.<br/><br/>Do you agree that there is a distinction in focus, system-wise ?</blockquote>\nI'm sure there are distinctions in focus - though I'm not entirely sure of them since I played Shadowrun only once at a convention and didn't get a good feel for the system beyond it being complicated.  I've played Apocalypse World three times along with about ten times playing offshoot systems - though I've never used the Turncoat.  <br/><br/>The Turncoat playbook emphasizes keeping secrets from the other PCs.  The character sheet is a lot longer than the Shadowrun Covert Ops sheet.  On the other hand, it also reads to me as being rather one note - i.e. the material given is <i>only</i> about being a good liar and sneak, with nothing else there.  The Shadowrun character is shorter on text, and emphasizes being a good teammate rather than distrusted spy, and has more of a variety of capabilities.  <br/><br/>Since Champions introduces disadvantages in 1981, there's been ongoing debates in RPGs about building "hooks" into the character sheet - like being watched and ordered around by a shadowy cabal, having a boyfriend who gets in trouble, and so forth.  People vary in how much they like this, so disads have become common but not ubiquitous.  Their use also varies within modern story games.  I don't pull strongly in either direction - I think it depends mostly on how well it is implemented either way.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418084/#Comment_418084" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-10T10:49:22+00:00" title="July 10, 2013 10:49AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 10, 2013 10:58AM by komradebob.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><i>Trust</i> isn't realistic at all, sorry.

The first group is noobs who have very little experience with any sort of RPG ( or similar) and who are approaching it from a play pretend/story making mindet. The second group that it seems to work well with, if invited selectively, are people with an enormous amount of experience with RPGs and similar.<br/><br/>It's the people somewhere between the two extremes that seem to have the difficulty with it.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418087/#Comment_418087" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-10T12:47:49+00:00" title="July 10, 2013 12:47PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know,  about Trust and some other stuff, there's been something else biting me about this whole subject, though I can't completely nail it. You see, it's like when as a designer you want players to experience something in a game so you enforce the things that lead to that experience in the rules. You can introduce moves, feats, stats and procedures that produce specific color, so players see this, get inspired and make it happen in the game.<br/><br/>But then on the other side, players that already come inspired to play their characters in a certain way crash into the rules like a wall that blocks their creativity.<br/><br/>Back to the designer's side, another designer tired of these rules that block his way of playing comes up with a more narrative rules-lite game. Kudos for him, except that now here comes a player who gets a blank page syndrome when trying to play this game! <br/><br/>Well, I know, different games for different players, so nobody is to blame here. But I'd really like to find an story game that doesn't depend so heavily on players focused creativity, or that haves otherwise such high expectations on players as expecting not to cross each other, joke on serious scenes and not game the system. I'm really fond of all the interesting mechanics and procedures I've seen in these and other forums, but I have only being able to play a single game from here as it was designed with my group of players. Another 6 or so, I've had to hack to be able to play them. For most of the rest, I took what I found inspiring and tried it on another game with different results.<br/><br/>I'm beggining to discern better what things will work on a bigger player audience, what things players can adapt to and what may feel totally unnatural to most. It's got nothing to do with trad vs. indie, but more about gaming psychology and social psychology. I feel like the answer is there, more than in marketing strategies. It's got something to do with integrating gaming advice with game design and making the whole subject of how to play RPGs clearer to a broader audience. I've seen comics used to explain rules, but this is the first time I've seen one detailing the procedures we are totally used to explained nicely for non-gamers. Thanks a lot Dave, I'm totally stealing this! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> (funny thing, I'm a comic artist and didn't thought of this before :P )<br/><br/>Now, about the tangent you pointed KomradeBob, you're right: it easier to find something to appeal to people who are on the extremes of the spectrum. One possibility is that these people had a bad experience with RPGs; we know there's a high number of things that can go wrong with a session and that most of the time it has to do with playing the wrong game with the wrong people in a wrong time of their lives.<br/><br/>There's also a lot of misinformation about the hobby, perhaps because it's a complex one and it takes a lot of time and examples to explain, and even more to learn enough to enjoy it. Dozens of times I've heard that excuse for not trying it: "it sounds/looks too complex for me"<br/><br/>There's the feelings of shame/embarrasment against re-activating the use of your imagination, something that somehow society still thinks only kids should do. Perhaps this one is -still surprisingly to me- a heavier reason than any other. Should we make and sell a few games more like "this is an adult game as serious as poker"? Perhaps stick it with the image of 40 year olds, playing at a table with some beers beside a fireplace adorned with the head of a dragon and a couple of orc axes? Jhonnie Walker add style? I dunno. A lot of people still seem to think this hobbie is about child-like escapism. We all know that's unfair, I'd really like to be able to change that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418088/#Comment_418088" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-10T12:52:55+00:00" title="July 10, 2013 12:52PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm really fond of all the interesting mechanics and procedures I've seen in these and other forums, but I have only being able to play a single game from here as it was designed with my group of players.

You actually need to understood these in order to play an RPG. Sure, as you can see in the comic, the way we all lerned it was by either seeing them in action with experienced players just like in the comic, or learn by trial and error. Of course, since we al learn this by mimicking other's players behavior we think it's the only way to learn to play the game. If I had seen these twenty years ago, I'd probably got quicker into the hobby by my own, without needing to see experienced players in action. Not even actual detailed play accounts can explain this better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418105/#Comment_418105" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-10T17:42:43+00:00" title="July 10, 2013  5:42PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 10, 2013 9:50PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            W-Monk, thanks so much for the thoughtful analysis!  This is great.  Before I respond point-by-point, let me say a bit about where I'm coming from:<br/><br/>I spent years playing with close friends who were also, at various times, guilty of all the behaviors you mentioned.  I've boiled the problematic bits down to two primary causes: the fight for agency (how do I get to meaningfully act in this game?) and the fight for advantage (how do I get what I want over another player?).<br/><br/>I think there are two ways to solve these problems:<br/><br/>a) Do away with all judgment calls.  Have all game actions operate on system info rather than fictional info.<br/><br/>b) Provide a very clear rationale for how judgment calls will be made and how fictional info will be used.  To play Game X is (among other things) to use Rationale X for deciding anything that's based in fictional situations like "my character's good at this", "high ground matters", "armor is heavy", etc.<br/><br/>For Delve, I went with (b).  I think the questions, then, are whether the Delve Rationale is (1) clear enough to be used in every play situation that arises, and (2) compelling enough that anyone would find it more appealing than a different rationale.<br/><br/>It sounds to me that you find the Delve Rationale fairly clear and somewhat compelling, but not compelling enough to get players to truly buy into it and use it, rather than proceeding as they're accustomed.  If that's the case, then yeah, you might be right, many players may simply not be interested.<br/><br/>However, perhaps I'm reading you wrong, and clarity is the issue.  Is it obvious that "don't assume", "likely?", "not plausible" etc. are all tools for applying the Delve Rationale ("fictional plausibility and causality is our judgment criteria") and supporting how the game is played ("immersion in being there, seeing the fiction through your character's eyes, tackling it with the tools at their disposal")?<br/><br/>If it's not obvious, then I'd like to see what I can do to improve that, and I'll respond to your points individually.<br/><br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418131/#Comment_418131" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-11T08:59:39+00:00" title="July 11, 2013  8:59AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2013 9:01AM by WarriorMonk.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glad I can be helpful, Dave! Ok, I'll clarify a bit more: your tools are right, but there's another core component of player-gm interaction you're missing. It has something to do with well, let's call it the<i> Hierarchy of the pack</i>, who's the alpha male/female of the group. Ok, I know it sounds crazy and you're either totally sure this doesn't happen in your group, that you're the Alpha or that you know who it is but also know how to deal with that person.<br/><br/>In the first case, I'd tell you: it actually happens, and it has nothing to do with male chauvinism. It also happens in groups of women and mixed groups, and then not always the male get to be alpha.<br/><br/>Now, this doesn't mean there's agressivity on the whole deal. Civilized adult people do this all the time in such a refined way that the term "Civilized adults" got coined for this. For most of us it isn't something we do conciously, it's already engraved in our mind so deep that we not only use it but also read it in others quite skillfully. Read again the comic and imagine small variations in the tones of the voice (mocking, doubtful, higher, harsh, cautious), different timing for responses (quick, leaving a long pause after, separating the words) postures (leaning forward, backwards, sitting uncomfortably, shifting) gestures (crossing arms, tics, pointing, etc) eye movement, etc. You'll see what Im getting into here. These are also clear communication tools that convey the rest on the information we don't say, which in this case is a negotiation of who gets the better what and when.<br/><br/>Games are fun (among many other things) because they reset established hierarchy for a moment, allowing people to fight their way to a simbolic best position without hard feelings or real consequences. It's part of what makes them relaxing. So when we roleplay, we rewrite the world and change our place in it; If we do it trough collaboration, the negotiation is just about who does what, when and the general direction of it; efforts are piled up and we see how our input is validated and built upon. Friction is almost zero. It's possible when your group is in the right state of mind on the same page towards the exact same goal.<br/><br/>But when there's a challenge or a disagreement of some sort and people get to value things on either side of it, negotiation begins. Yes, your tools get into that, Dave. But then, who gets the better benefits over the negotiation? The one who negotiates the best, who not only uses the tools given by the game but skillfully jumps over the fences you put as a designer without breaking a single rule nor stepping over the social contract (this is, by getting anyone annoyed -you can still breake some parts of the social contract by making everybody laugh about it, the result is that the contract will readapt itself and the group will roll with it until somebody gets annoyed) Then friction begins, though it won't set ablaze, at least between civilized adults. As you can see now, this term doesn't mean there won't be friction, it just means that the negotiation will be more subtle.<br/><br/>Games with more complex numeric simulations will always have it's place among people who can't thread well on social negotiation, that's why you will always find groups of rpg players who won't say more than a few words during a session besides of "I hit it with my axe". When one number is clearly higer than other there's no need for argumentation and these fellas will probably feel more relaxed because of that.<br/><br/>If everybody in your group has mastered social negotiation the hierarchy will probably shift quickly depending on the situation and nobody will have a single problem with it. In my cas I'd say I have a mixed group. I've seen them get quite creative, being happy with just rolling the dice, do silly excuses of an argumentation and being stoned by the rest of the group for it and have surprising comebacks later. As a GM I've been put in a hard spot, concede a lot only to get back at the players later, do the complete opposite to throw them out of balance, etc. <br/><br/>So I can tell for sure Delve will work for my group only in a good day, when everybody is at it's best and I can keep my own creativity one step ahead of theirs, but not too far because they will smell and ruin my plans from a mile away. And when we get to the negotiation, we will probably discuss for an hour an scene that could otherwise take ten minutes, even if we get the hang of the system. Because we're all more or less at the same level as negotiators and though I'm more or less the Alpha of my group, the game puts that on hold. And we know more than one way to jump that fence in the form of the <i>Trust</i> tool you made without breaking a single rule, nor breaking the social contract.<br/><br/>You see, actually that tool can be invoked whenever someone get's suspicious about small things that your character is doing for no apparent reason (which is actually to use them as leverage in a situation later where such things will matter more and might even breake the setting). It can be used to either make you come clean or accuse others of breaking the game. Others can be used to game the system and stop the GM on it's rails, like the "not plausible" case I mentioned. So, if I can see a lot of ways your rules can be used to game the system and thwart negotiations, be sure that my players will find even more. And as the old friends of mine they are, they will absolutely use them all to breake the game and make fun of me and each other instead of playing a good rpg and inmersing in fiction. Not that we don't have fun with both things, but the former we do all the time without the need of rules and the later is one of the main reasons we roleplay.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418158/#Comment_418158" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-11T15:25:30+00:00" title="July 11, 2013  3:25PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well said, I know exactly what you're talking about.  I had to deal with that, and here's how I did it:<br/><br/>First, really get buy-in to "playing this game seriously".  Seriously doesn't mean "no jokes", but it does mean that whenever someone distracts from the game, they're ruining the fun.  If your group doesn't want to put some effort into focusing on the game and having a fun game, and would rather simply have a fun evening regardless of the game, then I'd give up right there and play a board game or a very light-hearted RPG.<br/><br/>If they can get behind the idea of serious gaming, next I'd pitch Delve's style of play.  "Let's do the immersive pretend-you're-there thing!  Not just for drama's sake, but also because that's how we'll solve problems -- as if we were there."  I love this style, so I'd go on about how it's awesome, and see if I could get buy-in.  If your group doesn't get excited about that, then Delve is the wrong game.  I'd play something else -- what have you guys had most success with?<br/><br/>So, finally, if they really want to do the immersive style and take it seriously, <i>then</i> I'd tell them "here's how we make it work".  I'd spell out exactly how "integrity of the fiction always trumps anyone's personal advantage" will get us where we want to be.  Again, I need buy-in to this idea before proceeding.  This can be a very long and philosophical discussion about past play, what's worked, what hasn't, etc.  The goal is twofold -- to convince the skeptics that (a) even if they have their doubts, it's worth trying, and (b) there is actually hope for success (I'd offer my 48-session game of mostly excellent play as proof).<br/><br/>So now we have a framework for evaluating anything anyone does at a given moment.  The only way you can achieve advantage in the game is by <i>first</i> establishing what's what in the fiction and <i>then</i> working with that.  Players can't make up fictional facts, just as characters can't invent their surroundings.  Remember, <i>you are your character!</i> <br/><br/>Is this counter-intuitive at first?  For your group, of course it would be.  It would feel really strange to do what the comics say.  "Instead of just announcing an action, I'm supposed to share my intent first and make sure I'm not missing any fictional details?  WTF?  I'm not gonna spend all game asking the GM's permission!"  I would take this as a teaching moment:<br/><br/>You'll say, "I'm gonna do X, cool?" a million times, and a million times the response will be "cool" or "if you want to, but remember Y", and at the end of the session you won't have had any arguments.  <i>It's worth it.</i><br/><br/>The one hang-up is that you give the GM an opportunity to foil you.  The GM is not trying to foil you.  The GM gains nothing from foiling you.  The GM is trying to <i>help</i>.  Which is what you're asking for: not permission, but information.  Shared information is the foundation of shared imagined stuff.<br/><br/>Perhaps that GM role needs to be highlighted more in the comics.  The GM is always on the players' side.  The GM just needs to do certain things in order to provide adversity for the characters.  Otherwise, the whole group is in the "make a plausible and usable fiction" project together, with equal voices.<br/><br/>What do you think?  Does this address your player dynamics?  Whoever's the alpha should use their alpha-dom to enforce the values that this endeavor was predicated on.  If someone wants to be the clearest and most communicative and most plausible player in the room, then good for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418171/#Comment_418171" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-11T19:48:36+00:00" title="July 11, 2013  7:48PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, it's not like my players can't straight play an RPG at all. They can and when they are focused, they make magic happen. I could talk for hours about our adventures and make the finest and most epic novels out of their characters deeds, but we have a way of dealing with it, and the less rules get in the way and instead help them keep their focus, the faster and fun the game runs.<br/><br/>You know, I actually thought going full inmmersive was THE way to play the game, until I saw some youtube videos of actual play. I was like "boy, these dudes are playing with a hangover or something? They are making playing monopoly look like fun!" We do speak in character instead of saying "yeah my characters tells her that" and whoever is GMing goes with the character voices, soundtrack music and asks players to describe exactly what their characters intent to do instead of saying "I hit it" and rolling the dice.<br/><br/>There's actually only been one case of a player stating actions instead of intentions. Everybody noticed when he did this, it broke the social contract and it was annoying. We talked him off and kept the game going, though he kept doing that from time to time, while I kept disregarding the way he conveyed his input and interpretating it as an intention anyway. Thankfully now he doesn't have the time to play with us.<br/><br/>The main reason I can tell your tools are ok is because we actually use them; from all I've seen in the comics, yes that's about the way we play. What's different then?<br/><br/>-My group of players make <i>Assumptions</i> anyway, though I'm sure if I'd reinforce that as an actual mechanic for the game we're playing, they'll keep pushing that button to death. Yeah, assumptions are cool, stating them openly is great, but our rate of assumptions per game is on its limit.<br/><br/>-<i>Not Plausible</i> is also something I wouldn't enforce; If I gave them such a powerful tool to stop me in my tracks when I'm framing an scene, again, they would press that button just to annoy me. Not because they find fun to ruin the session and the mood, but because<i> we find really hard to resist making a good joke</i>. Yes, we're a bit like Rogger Rabbit at that. Of course, we can cut it out eventually, but I'd prefer not to risk that reaction. <br/><br/>On top of that, I use descriptions that may be misleading at first but come clearer a bit later to attain a better effect for twists and misterious developments. In your very example, when the GM starts to describe the houses suddenly looming and the town turning into a maze, that would be something I'd be doing on purpose to give them a cue something supernatural is going on. If they were to stop me with a not plausible argument, that would breake inmmersion and I'd have to stop and make some exposition about demonic powers to convince them. Oh, yes, I'd have gone with the exposition part in game before by adding an NPC to explain something about it, but come on, that would totally ruin the surprise.<br/><br/>-On the Complex Decisions, I'd totally go with the players first idea; if it looks cool, it's risky, shows they are thinking outside the box and -specially- if it doesn't fit my plans, it's totally worth it. I was a fan of the PC's before AW was written. Yeah, I'm some sort of hipster GM. But what do I do when an argument arises? I deal with it in three steps:<br/><br/>1) I think fast if I can roll with the player\xb4s input and turn it against him later. Often player notices when I do this and steps back quickly. (bwahahahaha!) I also bluff them with this trick from time to time.<br/>2) If definitely I can't roll with it, we state a couple of arguments each. That's it, no negotiation lasts more that 2 minutes or two arguments. Here goes the "Yes, but remember Y" part as well.<br/>3) if no one seems persuasive enough, I say yes or ask the player to roll the dice. Dice are the best arbiters ever. Once rolled, nobody can blame no one but their own bad luck. Oh, Step 3 could come right after or even instead step 1 btw.<br/><br/>-The method described above replaces your <i>Trust</i> rule in our games. It's like we say it with actions instead of demanding trust from each other. When they see me rushing past arguments straight into solutions, they mimic my way of dealing with things and often end up appying them by their own. They counter-argument themselves before I can took that chance to turn it against them, but if I still find their original idea interesting I encourage them to go with it even without rolling the dice. When dice becomes the final arbiter nobody can blame the GM or the players and all the results seem totally fair. (It's actually such a good negotiation tool we use it when we're writing comics)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418175/#Comment_418175" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-11T20:52:01+00:00" title="July 11, 2013  8:52PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2013 8:58PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, okay, I gotcha.  So, yeah, I wouldn't expect my procedures to be too compelling to your group if that's what y'all do already.  You don't need my help!<br/><br/>I think some of the details here are still worth discussing, though.  I'm not clear on what's up with the GM and player being antagonistic in your game.  It sounds like a muddy area, where sometimes it's friends messing with each other in a way that doesn't harm play at all, but other times it sounds like you and the players are actually trying to use the fiction to out-do each other.  In my experience, that's always bad news, and I'd rather prevent it than cope with it by way of your numbered points.<br/><br/>But maybe you guys <i>like</i> trying to out-do each other?  I'm now very unclear on what it is about the way your group plays that you actually would like to change.<br/><br/>A few clarifications, in case they're relevant:\n<blockquote>-My group of players make <i>Assumptions</i> anyway, though I'm sure if I'd reinforce that as an actual mechanic for the game we're playing, they'll keep pushing that button to death. Yeah, assumptions are cool, stating them openly is great, but our rate of assumptions per game is on its limit.</blockquote>Perhaps that comic isn't clear.  My intent was to say "it's natural to make assumptions; try to minimize that".  The play style I'm advocating is "<i>don't</i> assume".\n<blockquote>-<i>Not Plausible</i> is also something I wouldn't enforce; If I gave them such a powerful tool to stop me in my tracks when I'm framing an scene, again, they would press that button just to annoy me.</blockquote>Hey, it's not for the players to use against the GM!  It's for anyone at the table to use against anyone else at the table who tries to introduce something that isn't plausible.  If you guys want to joke about it, the joke's on everyone equally.  <br/><br/>If your group doesn't need this, then cool, but your example (so far, anyway) doesn't make me think this isn't a good idea for other groups.\n<blockquote>On top of that, I use descriptions that may be misleading at first but come clearer a bit later to attain a better effect for twists and mysterious developments.</blockquote>If the fictional situation is misleading to the characters, awesome, by all means, present it that way!<br/><br/>But if you're denying the players relevant info that their characters would have, please, please stop!  It utterly sabotages the creation of a shared fiction that everyone can interact with.  I can back this up at length, but I'm hoping it's not necessary.\n<blockquote>In your very example, when the GM starts to describe the houses suddenly looming and the town turning into a maze, that would be something I'd be doing on purpose to give them a cue something supernatural is going on. If they were to stop me with a not plausible argument</blockquote>Crap, good point, I used a bad example.  As GM, I would do the same thing you'd do, describing a magical effect to evoke the demon's powers.  I mean, I do that all the time.  The example in the comic was just supposed to be an example of accidental, careless description, not trippy magic.  I'll try to come up with a clearer, magic-free example.\n<blockquote>-On the Complex Decisions, I'd totally go with the players first idea; if it looks cool, it's risky, shows they are thinking outside the box and -specially- if it doesn't fit my plans, it's totally worth it. I was a fan of the PC's before AW was written. Yeah, I'm some sort of hipster GM.</blockquote>Is there anything in my comics that you see opposing this?  It sounds to me like we're totally on the same page!  The <i>only</i> reason the GM objects to the characters hopping up onto a 7-foot roof is because a 7-foot roof is not plausible.  These are houses with foundations above ground level and sloped thatched roofs and it's abundantly apparent to the <i>entire group</i>, once it comes up, that these <i>can't</i> be 7 feet.<br/><br/>Maybe I need to change the wording in the comic so it's clear <i>why</i> the GM feels compelled to correct his earlier mistake instead of letting it stand?\n<blockquote>When dice becomes the final arbiter nobody can blame the GM or the players</blockquote>I'm glad it works this way for you, but trust me, for many other groups, this is absolutely not true at all.  Someone says "roll", a die is rolled, it goes badly, a result is narrated, and then the roller goes "we were rolling for <i>that?</i>  I shouldn't have to roll for <i>that!"</i><br/><br/>I use rolls, but before the dice hit the table I look around to verify that we all agree that this could, in fact, go either way.<br/><br/>If that's what you mean by "going past the argument straight to the solution", then cool, we're on the same page.  The comics are actually intended to show that.  The "complex decisions" one may seem long, but that's a first effort, and if you actually read it out loud, it's like 90 seconds -- <i>way</i> shorter than most troublesome RPG discussions.  With a bit of practice, 90 approaches 0.<br/><br/>I have a "what this looks like once everyone's used to it" comic that I haven't put online yet.  I should probably hurry up and do that...

Yes, your tools get into that, Dave. But then, who gets the better benefits over the negotiation? The one who negotiates the best, who not only uses the tools given by the game but skillfully jumps over the fences you put as a designer without breaking a single rule nor stepping over the social contract (this is, by getting anyone annoyed -you can still breake some parts of the social contract by making everybody laugh about it, the result is that the contract will readapt itself and the group will roll with it until somebody gets annoyed) Then friction begins, though it won't set ablaze, at least between civilized adults.

Someone can do well in the social hierarchy and yet still want to play a game where the status is different than a normal popularity contest.  Personally, I enjoy a lot of complex and non-complex numeric simulations - from the board game Power Grid to the RPG Champions.  I also enjoy a lot of non-numeric games like Fiasco, Once Upon a Time, and A Thousand and One Nights.  <br/><br/>1) You don't need to have mastered a skill to enjoy playing a game that involves the skill.  One of the most fun things about games is learning.  <br/><br/>2) Even if you have mastered a skill, that doesn't mean that you always want it featured in your games.  \n<blockquote>So maybe we can just write a few games for people who have mastered those fairly common skills?<br/><br/>That guy who hasn't?

We can have both of these kinds of games, and disparaging one kind doesn't make the situation better for either.  If I say, "Non-numeric games are good for people who just haven't mastered their basic math skills" - that is insulting and untrue - and furthermore, dumping on non-numeric games doesn't do anything to help numeric games.  <br/><br/>I would like to see more complex numeric sim games, because I think there is still a lot of room for innovation within that space.  I feel there was a peak of innovation among these in the 1980s, and after that most complex RPGs have been just re-hashing and simplification of a few of those designs (like RuneQuest, Champions, HarnMaster, and Corps).                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418233/#Comment_418233" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-12T12:33:54+00:00" title="July 12, 2013 12:33PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ups! Sorry Dave, my bad; I readed that your comics were meant for learning AND trouble-shooting, but this last word slip from my mind until I readed your last post. Perhaps it should be made clearer which is which in the comic, presenting a the normal procedure and a bad example on the side. And yes, that comic of how it looks when everyone is used to it should do wonders.<br/><br/>Now, about my players, I wouldn't exactly change a thing. I'd just like to show them new tricks in a fashion that makes sense to them, taking into account what they have learned from roleplaying all these years. I know I can't just bring a new game to the table and say to them "Ignore your experience about negotiating the fiction and be innocent like a child again, because this game won't work if you don't". Even if they try from the bottom of their heart at first, it won't last too much, the old wolf in them will see the holes in the fence and will poke at them just for fun. As a designer, I'm actually thankful for this; playtesters like these can tear up your game in no time, so if you can make something able to stop them for a while and inmmerse into the fiction you can be damn proud and sure your game is solid, the fluff is engaging,  your crunch isn't broken and the system can't be gamed that easily.\n<blockquote>  I'm not clear on what's up with the GM and player being antagonistic in your game.

Moods and hierarchy are dynamic in our game, who has the upper hand dictates who's the Alpha in that moment, so there will be moments when the group goes collaborative and moments when competition will reach the real world trough the fiction. So, yes, for us out-doing each other is fun, makes for the best twists in the game, and player's reactions are as awesome as character reactions, and I'm talking of the stuff of legends here. But it isn't as if we prepare too much for it or antagonize outside the game. In our experience that only happens when arguments last too long. Unclear rules that foment arguments are our worst enemy because of this, and that's why we avoid complex trad games with too much legal-holes, or houserule so much that it's more like hacking the game.\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>On top of that, I use descriptions that may be misleading at first but come clearer a bit later to attain a better effect for twists and mysterious developments.</blockquote>If the fictional situation is misleading to the characters, awesome, by all means, present it that way!<br/><br/>But if you're denying the players relevant info that their characters would have, please, please stop!

I can back this up at length, but I'm hoping it's not necessary.<br/></blockquote>\nOh no, of course, I know the difference between railroading, illusionism, cooperativism and sharing a fiction with the players, but I've learned to integrate tools from all of these when needed and never stick to a single one for too long. I had never thought of how we do this before, knowing the cue for one into another and all that. I'd say it's like a mix of the Trust tool (which as I wrote, we use implicitly demonstrating it with our actions) and a bit of force when a player attemps to interrupt the GM. It feels a bit harsh but when it's over everybody realizes it's been for a greater good and moves on.<br/><br/>Of course, there are important key parameters for making this work:<br/>-It requires the GM be in the same page with all the relevant up to the moment player input, like positions, last actions, attitude, who's watching what, etc. The GM usually asks two times top to be sure and this acts as a cue that a) something unavoidable is about to happen b) the GM is inspired so this is gonna be good.<br/>-It should be obvious that this development is the result of a really good or really bad player input, either by evidence of several good/bad rolls in a row or just poor (informed) choices.<br/>-It doesn't last more than a single continuous description. Once the GM pauses, players can attempt to intervene. If there's still some railroading after that, the GM may force another description but that's all the social contract can stand.<br/>-If one or more players roll with it turning the railroading into a cooperative scene, the GM leaves the spotlight for them. It means they are inspired and an inspired player is a miraculous-sacred-untouchable-talking-cow for us at that moment.<br/>-For that single moment, rolls might become irrelevant as story reigns. Either the GM or players get away with it for free according to the fiction.<br/><br/>My pal also uses a surprise round from the NPCs whenever he's sure no character will get killed. Specially useful when PCs are good enough to kill NPCs and monsters in a single round. It helps keep the sense of danger sometimes, arbitrary as it may sound. Nothing says THIS is DANGEROUS like having your character scratched; not even seeing a powerful NPC being killed by it.\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>When dice becomes the final arbiter nobody can blame the GM or the players</blockquote>I'm glad it works this way for you, but trust me, for many other groups, this is absolutely not true at all.

How is that good? Well, for once we assume both our arguments are right, so no hard feelings there. The final arbiter isn't logic, but luck, so no need to appeal further into it. Our social contract has include this agreement for so long that now we trust that after this roll there won't be further discussion.

Sometimes I just like dice and rolling them. Sometimes I like polyhedral dice for no other reason than they aren't cubes and they reminded me of cool little jewels the first time I ever saw them.<br/><br/>For myself, I think color first, with very little in the way of mechanics has a real problem. It's something that actually really bothers me.<br/><br/>I know it can work. <br/>I know it can also be fragile if not handled well by a group ( although that can be overcome or simply never be a problem in the first place).<br/><br/>The big problem I see with it is that it doesn't lead to commercially viable products in an obvious fashion. Because it doesn't have an immediately obvious way to be turned into a recognizable commodity, it doesn't spread conceptually. If it doesn't spread conceptually it doesn't get tinkered with and refined, and since that gets back to the earlier problem of lack of monetary gain, there isn't much in the way of encouraging people who do encounter it to tinker with it.<br/><br/>As I understand it, some people have gotten around the money motivation by substituting a prestige motivation.<br/><br/>Jeepformers and Scandinavian Larpwrights have done this, and to an extent, Aussie/UK freeformers have done this with their much lower numeric-relying systems in convention games. That seems to rely on being part of those specific convention circuits though and the particulars of convention-slot play influencing the evolution of that stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418268/#Comment_418268" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-13T06:30:10+00:00" title="July 13, 2013  6:30AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a tangent that does tie a bit into the color first discussion, I wanted to add/propose this bit.<br/><br/>I'm big on genre emulation/Right to Dream stuff.<br/><br/>Mechanically, I think it's possible to approach this not so much from the POV of "How do we model these various things mechanically", but from a POV of mechanically asking things like:<br/><br/>Does this fit/not fit with our source material inspirations?<br/>If we* think it's time to throw a die, is this just asking for a spread of results within our expectations, based on genre/source material inspirations?<br/>(*Related question: Who decides that?)<br/>Is this a time when we are interested in the possibility of a "twist" on expectations?<br/>( Some really great stuff related exactly to love of genre/love of source material comes when an expectation is exactly up-ended.

I freely admit that. <br/><br/>It just strikes me that Color-first somehow fits in with all of that, stays numeric and even dice-loving, but without a need to drill down to physics-modeling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418275/#Comment_418275" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-13T12:20:18+00:00" title="July 13, 2013 12:20PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree, the hard part for the designer is to create the numerics to support and reflect the physics of the original material. I've found that easier when mechanics focus in simulating story facts, effects and twists instead of actually simulating the physics on the genre, which can be actually sort of hand-waved, since most of the time writers hand-wave it, to begin with. What good writers keep is internal logic, not actual physics modelling. Nail that internal logic on the rules and you'll get the best tool for emulating the original material.<br/><br/>A good example is the A Song of Fire and Ice RPG rules that allow you to bring your character back from the dead in the least expected moment to backstab his enemies, explaining later how he cheated death before. Of course, you'll need to pay some game-currency for this and send some notes to the GM while your character is about to die to pull this one, but it actually does a lot to help players emulate the original material.<br/><br/>Me, I find so hard to create mechanics to fit exactly a known franchise (and also something that I wouldn't be able to sell unless I'd make arrangements to get the rights for it) that I end up hacking mechanics and optimizing them, to find later what kind of situations these can produce. Of course, I kinda see the possibilities ahead of my designs and sorta keep them under control, but it's fun to see players take what you made, make it their own and use in ways you never expected... providing you're not the GM, or that you have the tools to counter it, of course.<br/><br/>Genre is another thing, it can be emulated, but we still need to extract and tech the techniques and procedures that fit better for each genre.<br/><br/>-For Horror you need mechanics that give players zero to very few chances of facing the unknown, and keeping the unknown as that for the longest part of the session. Techniques go for every trick used for campfire stories, playing with low lights, candles or in darkness with a single light source from a flashlight, lowing your voice, etc.<br/><br/>-Action needs fast paced mechanics that support all the moves and attacks from the genre and make player's choices even more awesome if possible (such as Dragon's Age Stunts). Techniques useful there are the ones for describing epic actions, either if the GM, the player or both get to do it. Sense of danger is key here, the GM needs to have his NPCs, traps and monsters actually do some harm, or the sense of danger is lost. So techniques that enforce the GM to do that in the precise moment are better than techniques that simply put everything in the GMs hands allowing him to railroad trhough all the session.<br/><br/>-Investigation needs ways to turn parts of the puzzles into numerics and have parts of them make players actually think. Too much of the first takes out the feeling and too much of the latter will suck dry the imagination of the GM to create such puzzles while allowing the players circumvent the prepared material and find another answer. Of course, something has to happen either if the puzzle is solved or if it isn't. For a game with a heavy investigative component, the information flow can't simply be stopped, because that  stalls the game.<br/><br/>-Mistery, High magic or science work on full internal logic for Mc Guffins: creatures/events/devices/spells can make something beyond comprehension happen but need X requirements for it; allowing/stopping/complying or failing to comply on those requirements is the whole subject of the game. Works nicely for suspense by impending doom.<br/><br/>But I'm going too much on mechanics when we should be discussing more about techniques I think. Most mechanics are already tested and tried, while techniques seem to be still something each group has to develop on it's own to be able to play the game, which seems to me like the main reason why some games won't work for different groups. Perhaps I'm missing some other key techniques Dave is using for Delve and that's the main reason it still doesn't completely appeal to me, who knows?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418276/#Comment_418276" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-13T12:52:58+00:00" title="July 13, 2013 12:52PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>...techniques seem to be still something each group has to develop on it's own to be able to play the game, which seems to me like the main reason why some games won't work for different groups.

My blindspots are problematic because I forget to explain things that are incredibly basic to my own understanding of what I'm talking about. When those combine with other peoples' blindspots on those topics, huge frustration occurs.<br/><br/><br/>With David talking about Delve, there are a lot of assumptions already in there. Some of them he hits on, others he trusts people already grok.<br/><br/>For example, he doesn't go too much into the GM's job to balance challenge versus frustration. It's a fine line, and a key part of what amounts to a pretty traditional ( in one tradition anyway) GM duty. He pretty much assumes you already know that.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418325/#Comment_418325" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-14T20:21:57+00:00" title="July 14, 2013  8:21PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            W-Monk, I actually think our disconnect may come from all the stuff that's in Delve to support "solve problems from your character's POV".  That part doesn't sound like a priority for you or your group, right?  Accordingly there's no need to know what that house looks like before you try to climb it.  If it'd be fun to be up there, you're up there; if it'd be fun to roll, roll.  I enjoy this in other games, but that's not what I'm going for with Delve.<br/><br/>As for physics and genre, I think they're always related.  If you ask me "what type of action movie is this?", one of the bases I'll be sure to cover is whether people are flying through walls and surviving, superhero-style, or whether the action is plausible in terms of real-world physics.  You can tell how important this is when a movie stumbles from one end to the other, like when Die Hard starts out pretty down to earth but then the end of Die Hard II abandons plausibility for a neat special effect and a lot of the audience goes "that's stupid".  I think we have names for these different genres -- "gonzo action" vs "gritty action", perhaps.<br/><br/>Delve leaves physics-fidelity up to the group out of <i>necessity</i>, as no ruleset can do a better job modeling the real world to the players' satisfaction than the players themselves.  What the game provides the players is <i>not</i> novel and unexpected takes on physics.  (Until magic gets involved.  Which is why magic is a big deal.)<br/><br/>Genre-emulation, on the other hand, can be faithfully modeled <i>or</i> given unexpected and novel twists <i>or</i> left up to the players <i>or</i> a mix of all of the above, I think.  But as you're designing mechanics for Vengeance and Righteousness and Turning Points, you still have to answer the question of "who deals with in-fiction physics?"  Is it up to the players entirely, or do you structure their conversation with procedures, or do you include some good old-fashioned measurement and simulation?  <br/><br/>I had a friend who liked Vampire tell me that "the rules handled the arbitration and causality stuff, leaving me free to focus on genre and mood".  I've heard the same said of Cthulhu games.  The problem I had in those games was specifically the problem Delve addresses -- despite whatever genre conventions applied, players <i>were</i> trying to problem-solve, and they <i>were</i> using the tool that had been highlighted for them: their character.<br/><br/>So if you want to avoid the physics-sim trap in your genre RPG, I think you'd better make it abundantly clear what the players' tools are for tackling the situations of play.  If you throw a threat at my character, it's second nature for me to treat this as a challenge, and start looking over my character attributes and gear to form an optimal response.  If what you want me to do instead is provide a response that is, above all else, <i>colorful</i>, then please get rid of attributes and gear and give me points for being entertaining.

That nails something that I hadn't been thinking about as much.<br/><br/>I'm almost always the GM when I game. It deeply impacts how I look at games.<br/><br/>And I really like GM type abilities. Really, I tend to like games that spread around "GM fun".<br/><br/>So something that is likely coloring my perceptions of all of this is that I don't tend to think of something as a challenge pointing me at the highlighted tool:character.<br/><br/>And that I guess is a pretty big blind-spot and bias on my part.<br/><br/>In a GM position, in a plain old traditional RPG set up, I have some things going for me in terms of tools, but also in terms of "victory conditions".<br/><br/>First, I largely have a promise that I can play through the whole time. An NPC I'm playing dies? Mostly, <i>so what?</i> is my main reaction. I have a zillion more I can portray, and even if I didn't, my contribution to the game doesn't flatline if any of them buy the farm.<br/><br/>My "victory conditions" are outside of the fiction. My victory conditions are about my pals, my players, giving me social level warm fuzzies. They give me the best compliment of all: they want to come back and play again with me.<br/><br/>With those in mind, I guess I understand a bit better why I can advocate for a color-first, low physics sim approach, and mechanics meant more for pulling people together on the fictional "what would happens" and more acceptance of twists as simply being fun, rather than defeats ( and defeats especially of the sort that knock some or all of the players out of participation).<br/><br/>That's what is making my own POV in this conversation a bit at odds with some of what other people are posting about I suspect.<br/><br/>One of the things I found liberating when I started playing games that hacked up GM type tools and spread them around was that I was more able to not give a shit about certain things that came with playing a character as my main tool. I could play big jerky, stupid, craven characters if I wanted to, just like I could as a GM. And they didn't kill play at all. Nor did their demise, sometimes actually incredibly satisfying to me despite being that character's player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418378/#Comment_418378" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-15T14:16:03+00:00" title="July 15, 2013  2:16PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>W-Monk, I actually think our disconnect may come from all the stuff that's in Delve to support "solve problems from your character's POV".

If as a GM I describe the house being 9 ft tall and players want to climb it, I'd argue less about why PCs can't climb it. In real life if it's a matter of life or death to climb a 9 tf wall and you're on a street you will think of at least 5 things that could make it possible; The simpler would be to ask a friend to lend you a hand. If as a GM I made a mistake and described it shorter than I wanted I'll just go with it instead of risking an argument with the players which would stop the flow of the game. If the mistake makes the fiction too silly and the challenge too easy, then players will probably admit it didn't sound plausible and allow a correction. So yes, it's a matter of group priorities here.\n<blockquote><br/>As for physics and genre, I think they're always related.

At least we adapt quiclky if that happens instead of stopping the GM on his tracks yelling <i>Not plausible!</i>. That's crucial for what makes our games cool for us. Not that we play, say, PF like anime, but whenever something unbelievable happens we adapt quickly instead of stopping the GM in his tracks with the <i>Not Plausible</i> argument.\n<blockquote><br/>Genre-emulation, on the other hand, can be faithfully modeled <i>or</i> given unexpected and novel twists <i>or</i> left up to the players <i>or</i> a mix of all of the above, I think.  But as you're designing mechanics for Vengeance and Righteousness and Turning Points, you still have to answer the question of "who deals with in-fiction physics?"  Is it up to the players entirely, or do you structure their conversation with procedures, or do you include some good old-fashioned measurement and simulation?</blockquote>\n<i>Blindspots</i> is the keyword here, Dave. As Komradebob wrote, we're still missing techniques that would be necessary for new players/GMs to understand what kind of interaction we use/are looking for and what that will produce in our respective games.<br/><br/>One of those is <i>Setting Precedents</i>, which I'd bet we both use but haven't mention yet and is partially key to understand what's going on here. In our case, the GM frames scenes and has his NPCs do things that set precedents for what can be done in the setting. Players also try things that set a precedent so when the rest of the players get familiar with these they start picking them up and using them in new and different forms. <br/><br/>In Delve's case it seems than both the GM and the players who do this, so the first negotiations of each group may take long but will reduce as sessions progress. Also, players don't just try stuff, they make sure it will work before trying it and thus never do anything that could be taken as stupid in the setting, making genre simulation more successful (I guess). Well, we like our stupid quota in the game just for the fun of it.<br/><br/>In our case the only problem at the beggining could be that the game was more GM dependant. I admit that since we had an experienced GM when we started playing, we didn't felt that slow start being an issue. We picked the rest of techniques quiclky and that was it. Also, our GM was out for the players so he fudged rolls and broke rules when it meant a player effort could end up making an scene better. This also became usual for the rest of us when our turn to GM came up. <br/><br/>So, all players deal with in-fiction physics in our game, though the base limits are traced by the GM first when he's guiding the players to get the genre emulation right, an then everybody collaborates on those guidelines. No wonder why once a group is used to their own set of physics it becomes quite hard to adapt to a different ones even if the setting and game system are entirely different. But let's go back to the genre emulation part:                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418379/#Comment_418379" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-15T14:16:22+00:00" title="July 15, 2013  2:16PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (sorry for the double post)\n<blockquote><br/>I had a friend who liked Vampire tell me that "the rules handled the arbitration and causality stuff, leaving me free to focus on genre and mood".  I've heard the same said of Cthulhu games.  The problem I had in those games was specifically the problem Delve addresses -- despite whatever genre conventions applied, players <i>were</i> trying to problem-solve, and they <i>were</i> using the tool that had been highlighted for them: their character.<br/><br/>So if you want to avoid the physics-sim trap in your genre RPG, I think you'd better make it abundantly clear what the players' tools are for tackling the situations of play.  If you throw a threat at my character, it's second nature for me to treat this as a challenge, and start looking over my character attributes and gear to form an optimal response.  If what you want me to do instead is provide a response that is, above all else, <i>colorful</i>, then please get rid of attributes and gear and give me points for being entertaining.  (This is what I do for my supervillain game, Within My Clutches.)</blockquote>\nI sense another set of techniques missing there; looks like on those games of ctulhu and vampire you had, the GM didn't described enough physical detail on the scene nor enforced the importance of thinking outside the character sheet. We went there when we played Vampire but again, as I wrote, our GM rewarded us for thinking outside the character sheet and thus, this became a second nature for us when we roleplayed other games. The first time we played D&amp;D we negotiated our way out of a battle with a troll and came back to kill it later while it was still en encounter 5 levels above our character levels. And we're talking level 1 characters here, with another GM that was actually old school but still unaware of our fiction-negotiating abilities.<br/><br/>But again, we sorta agree except in things like priority of these techniques and when these should be applied. My point about this last part is that is easier to ask a single person to be fair, believable and cool (as Delve's rules demand of all players) and have this person spread this attitude among the players through example, than asking all players to be like that. Mostly because 90% of RPGs we have played at the table haven't been choosed unanimously and players will go to their own fun each until the setting motivates them to do something specific within the fiction limits. Until then they won't be totally fair, their choices will shatter against the setting's believeability until they tune then correctly and their cool factor will depend on how good and quick they tune into the genre emulation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418380/#Comment_418380" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-15T14:26:02+00:00" title="July 15, 2013  2:26PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave,<br/><br/>I think that in your vision of Delve, the attention to the shared fiction and its maintained internal consistency and believability is a strong focus. It's <i>important</i> that the description of the 7-ft wall wasn't right, even though in many games it wouldn't be. (As WarriorMonk points out, in many games it's just as effective to flip a coin to settle the important issue: well, can I climb it or not? I don't care how many feet high it is, I just want to know if I have to walking down the street or whether I can take a shortcut.)<br/><br/>I'm curious how universal this focus is in your Delve play. How often does it happen that the decision-making becomes of the second variety (e.g. "yes, this bit of the fiction/color is interesting, but not that important; we can just settle it arbitrarily or skip to the next important thing")? Does every kind of situation warrant this kind of careful "measure before you cut" approach? When do you, as the GM, just feel that you can "flip the coin", or go with player assumptions, instead? Does it happen often? How does that align with the game's larger goals/aims/agenda?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418384/#Comment_418384" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-15T17:40:25+00:00" title="July 15, 2013  5:40PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2013 6:09PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If the mistake makes the fiction too silly and the challenge too easy, then players will probably admit it didn't sound plausible and allow a correction.</blockquote>Cool, sounds like we're on the same page there.<br/><br/>I think what's worse than making a challenge too easy (or hard), though, is making it too vague.  In the Delve comics example, the challenge isn't "can you get on this roof?", it's "can you cut off the fleeing guy?"  Whenever this happens in an RPG, the players need to know the tools at their disposal before they start tackling the challenge.  The tools in Delve are horribly complex, but wonderfully clear -- <i>exactly the tools available to your character; no more, no less.</i>  So the players can apply their creativity only to established fictional facts, the way we, in the real world, can problem-solve based only on what is.<br/><br/>In your game, on the other hand, it sounds like the players can apply their creativity not just to what <i>is</i>, but also to what <i>could be</i>.  You don't weigh building-climbing against other options based on in-fiction speed and feasibility <i>alone</i>; you create cool story options with fun risks on the fly in a sort of gotcha-gotcha, "yes, but" player-GM negotiation.  Plausibility is a factor, but so are drama, story, entertainment value, humor, etc.<br/><br/>I imagine I'd succeed more in your style than I do in Delve!  I am an okay strategist when manipulating moving parts, but I am really good at making stuff up and entertaining a table full of gamers.  If I want to intercept the fleeing villain, and my tools aren't just "what does my character see, that he can work with?" but rather "can I come up with something cool?" then I will bet I'd intercept them.  And yeah, the GM had better ad-lib some adversity to balance out my ad-libbed advantages.<br/><br/>What I think both our approaches rely on, for smooth play, is that the players know <i>what they can and can't do</i> to pursue success.  If someone at <i>your</i> table limits themselves, Delve-style, they're going to be frustrated that everyone else is more effective by doing 9-foot jumps, assuming convenient roof heights, etc.  If someone at <i>my</i> table wants to make up advantages for themselves, the other players will look at them like, "are you cheating, or just crazy?"  I think that pretty much sums up the hitchy history of fiction-based arbitration.  <i>Someone at the table has an idea for what they or the GM can or should be able to do, and then that idea is violated, and now everyone's confused about how to proceed.</i><br/><br/>Having said all that, I'm curious: I know that you play the way you do, and not Delve-style, for real reasons.  But if you wanted to play Delve-style (just to try it out, or whatever), do you think you would know how?  Do you think that, from the comics and my descriptions here, you would be clear on <i>what you can and can't do?</i>  Would you be able to present it to others?  If not, where does it get vague or tricky?\n<blockquote>As Komradebob wrote, we're still missing techniques that would be necessary for new players/GMs to understand what kind of interaction we use/are looking for and what that will produce in our respective games.</blockquote>I have a feeling that you are correct, but I'm not sure what exactly is missing.  Hopefully my last question above gets at that.\n<blockquote>One of those is <i>Setting Precedents</i>, which I'd bet we both use but haven't mention yet</blockquote>Oh yeah, just like any complex activity, the folks who know it best (whether that's from years of experience, or just from being the one person at the table who's read the rulebook) need to demonstrate and lead the newcomers.<br/><br/>My hope with Delve is that whoever owns the book (or whatever form I publish this in) will "get it" well enough to lead, but I dunno.  Anyone who's played with me seems to get it, but I haven't yet tested it by handing it to strangers.  So I don't know how many of the precedents I'm setting follow directly from the game text, and how many are something I'm doing beyond that.<br/><br/>I'm wondering if there are fundamental concepts -- stuff like "this game is played by talking" etc. -- that I've either skipped in the comics or just not emphasized enough for anyone to remember.<br/><br/>Oh!  I know what I could do.  I could write a comic of someone introducing the game, addressing everyone else's expectations.  The thing is, I don't want to just repeat myself, and draw one guy sitting there going on and on for panels and panels talking about "here's how the game works".  Maybe instead I should draw a comic about a group who's already heard the pitch and is just now beginning to play, with a few requests for reminders, etc.\n<blockquote>In our case the only problem at the beginning could be that the game was more GM dependent. I admit that since we had an experienced GM when we started playing, we didn't felt that slow start being an issue. We picked the rest of techniques quickly and that was it.</blockquote>The main difference I see here is that rather than relating a <i>game's</i> techniques as imparted by its <i>text</i>, your GM was relating <i>his</i> techniques as learned through <i>experience</i>.\n<blockquote>I sense another set of techniques missing there; looks like on those games of ctulhu and vampire you had, the GM didn't described enough physical detail on the scene</blockquote>I attempted to cover that in the comics with "GM should provide, and players should request, all the relevant info the character would have when making their decision".  Do you think that's insufficient?  Was it not prominent enough?  Man, there's a lot of stuff to convey...\n<blockquote>The first time we played D&amp;D we negotiated our way out of a battle with a troll and came back to kill it later while it was still en encounter 5 levels above our character levels. And we're talking level 1 characters here, with another GM that was actually old school but still unaware of our fiction-negotiating abilities.</blockquote>If the GM was on board with the fiction-based challenge, that sounds awesome.  If the GM thought it was going to be a battle of stat blocks, that sounds awful.  Again my first thought is "does everyone know <i>what they can and can't do</i> to pursue success?"\n<blockquote>it is easier to ask a single person to be fair, believable and cool . . . and have this person spread this attitude among the players through example, than asking all players to be like that.</blockquote>Between those two options, yeah, I completely agree.  I'm hoping there's a third option, though, where I can simply ask players to use the procedures I provide, and doing that will result in play that's fair, believable and cool.  I've thought about structuring the game more tightly; at cons, I introduce the 3 Key Player Phrases:<br/><br/>- I survey the area (give me the basics, GM)<br/>- I look for [something in particular] (looking for an opportunity, advantage, or clarification)<br/>- I try to judge if (I have a plan, is it plausible?)<br/><br/>These are in the comics, but maybe not emphasized enough.\n<blockquote>90% of RPGs we have played at the table haven't been choosed unanimously and players will go to their own fun each until the setting motivates them to do something specific</blockquote>Good point.  A new set of techniques isn't just combating inexperience, it's often combating habits.  Most games successfully counter this with rules and rewards, not advice and instruction alone.  If I could come up with a way to give players gold stars every time they prioritize fairness and plausibility, I would.  In my experience, though, the immediate appreciation of the group is the real motivator, and all the formal bonuses I've cooked up have been superfluous.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418387/#Comment_418387" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-15T18:29:51+00:00" title="July 15, 2013  6:29PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2013 6:32PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>When do you, as the GM, just feel that you can "flip the coin", or go with player assumptions, instead?

Now this is making me thing some techniques will probably be closely related with matters of education (I just luv your players, GMing my group sometimes feels like teaching 2nd graders with ADHD in comparision) and taste (which would make some techniques harder to impose to other groups, though something like the<i> Veil</i> technique could make wonders here)\n<blockquote><br/>Having said all that, I'm curious: I know that you play the way you do, and not Delve-style, for real reasons.

When I'm not, but I like something from it, I end up hacking it. The bases of my doubt are always thinking how my group will react to the rules, which I reckon it's just a particular group and not exaclty a good measure of your target audience. And on top of that it can be just probably me and the game would actually work just fine with another GM and the same group. That said, I'm thinking of a worst case scenario, so maybe my advice will help you make a game more solid and/or something that could adapt better to players with worse playing habits:<br/><br/>-Probably you'd need a 10 page comic to explain the techniques and troubleshooting. Well done, this could actually dub as <i>the perfect phamplet for introducing everybody to any RPG ever written.</i> I'd like to try to make one myself, though we really need to investigate more about techniques to make it properly. This 10 page comic would feature an actual play that shows the common techniques in use, how interaction goes between players when everything goes right without problems and how the whole thing translates in the players mind (<a href="http://www.tabletitans.com/comic/first-encounters-page-9" rel="nofollow">here's an example</a>) Then comes the trouble-shooting techniques, and you may want to add some more pages to present the setting and characters <i>a la</i> Tenra Bansho<br/><br/>-I'd add some optional techniques to deal with players that tend to go competitive. Your "<i>are you cheating, or just crazy?</i>" is a fine one, actually. That whole paragraph you put up there actually clarifyes better the limits for the game. Specifically talking about what techniques are absolutely forbidden in this game and enforcing all players and GM to stop in his tracks whoever uses them will do a lot better than just emphasizing the right ones.<br/><br/>-Some actual examples of what constitutes a detail and what a consequence on that comic would do good for Delve. Also, show how <i>setting precedents</i> works, that way players will know for sure that fiction negotiation will be faster after a short while, instead of lasting the same or longer for each scene (that kinda put me out at first, thinking I'd probably had an argument with my players on each scene) Tie up <i>setting precedents</i> with <i>Not Plausible</i> since it sounds more fair to make that call when there are in-game precedents than when the precedent is just actual reality. Perhaps is just the example you used for Not Plausible, that makes it look like the GM has not enough control of scene framing and has to keep editing to scale it to the player's whim.\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>I sense another set of techniques missing there; looks like on those games of ctulhu and vampire you had, the GM didn't described enough physical detail on the scene</blockquote>I attempted to cover that in the comics with "GM should provide, and players should request, all the relevant info the character would have when making their decision".

I'd argue the intent is just the opposite with Phys-Sim, and that it's a fairly lengthy approach to giving us what we already expected, within a bound set of results.<br/>\n<blockquote>I don't think Fiasco, Microscope or PTA are supposed to primarily resolve disagreements or even smooth out differences.

Which, of course, those games don't. They just provide structure to determine which creative input has primacy in the event of a disagreement.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418513/#Comment_418513" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T07:44:05+00:00" title="July 17, 2013  7:44AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2013 7:49AM by David_Berg.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think most simulation mechanics secretly have unexpected drama coded into them by the mechanism of dice rolling.  That is, character efforts are thrown into the "maybe you can, maybe you can't!" area in vastly disproportionate amounts, compared to a "real life simulation".  In real life, there's usually no "maybe".  But in a typical "physics sim" game, even after all modifiers are applied, you can always roll the highest or lowest number and produce a wacky and improbable success or failure!<br/><br/>In Primetime Adventures, I see the unexpected drama factor as pretty identical.  An interesting effort is underway, we know which two ways it could go -- so which will it be?!  Will the side with a ton of cards win, or will fluke luck produce the unlikely alternative?  Same thing.<br/><br/>The difference between the two approaches is in how they choose which fictional things will qualify as "interesting efforts" deserving of the suspense of die rolls.  Physics sim presumes that physical tasks are interesting, while PTA presumes that character issues in crisis are interesting.<br/><br/>That's my take.  Maybe I'm biased, though.  I always find that the most interesting unexpected input comes from the other players, rather than from a random selection between known possibilities.  A game that gets players to contribute in unexpected ways -- now <i>that's</i> exciting!

Not all players feel comfortable about bonding with friends too deeply or emulating drama of human relationships; In my experience I've often seen some of these players manifest their dislike for such scenes by overthrowing (in plausible ways if possible, on the best case) all efforts that would lead that way by introducing humor or making the whole thing lead to a battle, where they'd feel more comfortable. <br/><br/>Yes, it's strange, I know we could have just talked it out on the table so we could limit the game to hack and slash, but it seems that they know those are unavoidable parts of the story that help make sense of the battles and thus are okey minding their own business while the more social PCs of the party get over with that. They'll go into humor or provoking a combat only if it goes for too long or they see an easy joke on it, though this attitude never reaches the limits of inmersion-breaking (if it did, I'd be the first to kick those players out)<br/><br/>The reason I actually advocate for dumping the complexities out of Phys-sim is that when every single player recalls a session to tell it to another person, they will go at it mainly in terms of what happened in the fiction, not at how the system or the group handled every single detail of the Phys-sym. Oh, they will remember how much a rule sucked if in that moment it provoked a not-plausible action, reaction or consequence, and they will remember a bad GM as one who went with it anyway or who blocked plausible or cooler inputs from the players either by following the rules or totally disregarding them. But the best memories will be those of how their incarnations beated the odds by overcoming an impossible challenge at the limit of their capacity and beyond, by strategizing their way out and by sheer luck.<br/><br/>Color, Phys-sim, Tecniques, Game Mechanics are all valid tools for this end. The best designers can do with them is make them more efficient towards the feeling they are trying to convey in their games, IMHO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418536/#Comment_418536" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T11:36:53+00:00" title="July 17, 2013 11:36AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I always find that the most interesting unexpected input comes from the other players, rather than from a random selection between known possibilities.

The core mechanic though is just a d6 roll, high is good, low is bad, interpret based on context of what is going on in the fiction.<br/><br/>What makes it interesting: Anyone can call for it, not just the GM. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Itras By cards, also used optionally in Archipelago</span><br/>Come to a point where you might throw a die in another game? Not sure where to go with it? Know that it could go in multiple directions?<br/>Point to one of the other players, have them draw one of those cards, and interpret what it means in context.<br/><br/>What makes it interesting: Anyone can call for this, but often it is the player of the active character in question encouraged to call for it. The cards have varieties of Yes/No/And/But, but with more added in there to give a little direction to their answer.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The main *World mechanic</span><br/>Yup, lots of stuff going on in this game, but still a little like Graham's Cthulhu Dark main mechanic. This one uses the bell curve of 2d6 added to give more mid-range results that mostly add up to "You succeeded with a complication of some variety". <br/><br/>What's interesting: designers have taken a bunch of key likely circumstances for those mid-range results and written up a bunch of starter complications for them. You aren't left with nothing at all to grasp onto or base your own complications on, and they set precedent for the sorts of complications that are reasonable on that 7-9 roll.<br/><br/>So I mean, yeah, those things are out there and they are popping up more in a fiction-first context and in a direction pretty far from phys-sim. They don't throw physics out entirely of course, as physics are part of what the fiction is based on. Those unexpected results do tend to come from the players themselves, their understanding of the fiction and the inspirational material (including genre and physics expectations) being the basic material those decisions come from.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418539/#Comment_418539" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T12:06:24+00:00" title="July 17, 2013 12:06PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2013 12:11PM by komradebob.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the things that is almost certainly not coming through in my posts is...<br/><br/>...I kinda love really crunchy d% systems.<br/><br/>I grew up on them.

Take chess: it's about two opposing armies, and there's even something you can interpretate from how the pieces move. It has such a strong iconograhpy that it's been used as a metaphor on other stories. Yet, you can also sit down and enjoy the tactical challenge and the competition, and completely forget about color. <br/><br/>In the case of stat-less game, it's not that there are no mechanics or rules, it's just that all of them might have been converted into Techniques, which are actually the functional base of the game.

Each point below is a subset or special case of the preceding point.<br/><br/>- <i>Why are we playing this?</i>  - To make stories that are like (among other sources) Coen Brothers movies.<br/>- <i>What should we do now?</i>  - Something that'd fit well in a Coen movie.<br/>- <i>What would/should/can happen in the fiction now?</i>  - Something that'd fit well in a Coen movie.<br/>- <i>Can my character physically do this?</i>  - If a character in a Coen movie could.<br/><br/>So if your guy falls off a 3-story building and you're wondering whether he's alive, the answer is that, well, if that happened in a Coen movie, he might die, or he might live with some awful/comedic disfigurement.  <i>So which is it?</i>  Well, the game never pretended to give you any tools for deciding such things, so clearly it's up to you.  Just pick.<br/><br/>The whole point of physics-sim is to support a play style in which such things are <i>contested</i> and thus it's not okay to let someone just pick.  By "contested" I mean that part of the fun is (e.g.) facing death and disfigurement as <i>hazards that you can avoid through skillful play</i>, or <i>prices that you pay for taking risks</i>, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418855/#Comment_418855" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-23T00:22:24+00:00" title="July 23, 2013 12:22AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2013 12:22AM by David_Berg.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>BTW, has anybody heard of some sort of recollection or list of Techniques?

I think the problem is that some techniques are hard to identify, others sound just like the advice that's been published in traditional RPG books for decades, and others utterly depend for their relevance on a given group, game, mechanic, or set of other techniques.  So what you get is an endless list of things like:<br/>- Make eye contact<br/>- Facilitator sits next to the quietest player<br/>- Narrate before you roll<br/>- Narrate after you roll<br/>- Form consensus before taking action<br/>- Take action quickly and decisively<br/>- Lead by example<br/>- Make sure everyone has read the rules<br/>- Trust the GM, the GM is your friend<br/>- Don't trust the GM, the GM is your enemy<br/>- Always have a random generator for when you need impromptu content<br/>- Raise a hand when speaking out-of-character<br/><br/>For that to be useful to anyone, I think we need "Why you'd do this", "What it achieves", and "When it can be used" for each technique, and now we're <i>really</i> getting voluminous.  <br/><br/>I think it could still be done, but it would take brilliant and thorough organization to make it valuable.

A group could go story now until they get to the battle part where they go full sim or gamist, or could even interrupt such battle in favor of more story. So, while the GNS did gave us the tools to recognice every moment, we are talking now in terms of how the processes engrain with each other and keep feeding the fiction.<br/><br/>This is still part of the GNS ground, for it deals with how the fiction is created, but is more oriented to player's ways of communication instead of modeling out what's happening in their minds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418863/#Comment_418863" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-23T06:25:38+00:00" title="July 23, 2013  6:25AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David: YES! Exactly!<br/><br/>That is, dead on, why I liked when people started bandying around the term "emulation" as a kind of subset of Sim ( damn, well, there's GNS coming in, right? Oh well, I'm unfashionable anyway!)<br/><br/>Phys-Sim conceptually has always been something more supportive of gamist play. It comes from gamist play <i>of a certain kind</i>. Specifically, stuff descended from wargaming, where it's about an in-fiction, player/character identified win.<br/><br/>Buuut... you can have emulationist approaches ( which is what you're describing with the Fiasco breakdown) in support of gamist play, by breaking away from the in-fiction, player/character identified win conditions. <i>Pantheon</i> ( and the related games) by Robin Laws does that. Those games are competitive at the player level. You don't inherently win because your character wins in the fiction, you score points because you narrate in stuff that fits with the genre being emulated. Sometimes the point scoring conditions can be at odds with one another.<br/><br/>Imagine your example of the guy falling out the window in a Coen emulating game. You've given two possible outcomes: he dies or he has some comic disfigurement. Okay good. feasibly, either could score points if you were going all gamist with this, possibly different points totals actually.<br/><br/><br/>Okay, so that last bit was kind of a tangent.<br/><br/>Getting back to the original topic a bit, color-first inherently has<br/>...some kind of tie to the source, inspirational material, and<br/>...may skip phys-sim in favor of human judgment based on the emulated material, and<br/>...is tied to the source material and players' understanding of it, even/especially when inverting or subverting the source material<br/><br/>None of that need imply Just Choose is the only viable mechanic, although it must always be in the thinking somewhere.<br/><br/>You could still have dice throws in there for example. <br/><br/>In a phys-sim approach, the question is: a character fell out of a 3 story window: What mechanics do we us and what does it show? Okay, let's go to the mechanics.<br/><br/>In [whateveritisI'mtalkingabut], it's more like: What outcomes are suggested by the source materials? Do we even feel the need to roll? If so, how to we weight the possible outcomes?<br/><br/>And, again, you could use those approaches in support of a more broadly gamist agenda. Here the game isn't "What can my character accomplish?" the game is "Which player knows the genre best and is most convincing ( including most convincing in their subversions)?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418869/#Comment_418869" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-23T07:31:56+00:00" title="July 23, 2013  7:31AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>AaronF, K-bob is right in the sense that GNS is actually <i>dynamic</i>; player groups move from one side of the spectrum to the other and back in a single scene, even the ones who tend to use one more than the others.

However, the Big Model (which post-dates GNS Theory, incidentally) was very clear in that it is felt in large-scale reward cycles of play, not small-scale moments at the table. So I don't see anything factually incorrect on that Wikipedia page (mind you, I only skimmed it quickly).<br/><br/>The Big Model folks found dealing with Creative Agenda as dynamic moment-to-moment not particularly useful and never used it this way. I don't remember why, exactly, but it was always an important element of the theory, and I think it was done that way for good reasons.<br/><br/>I would agree that it's potentially interesting to look at how, say, a player in a Story Now-prioritizing game might at some point make small-scale decisions based on other priorities, but I've never seen anyone do that fruitfully.

It's not <i>always</i> true.  Play that emphasizes color can come about for other reasons too.  Or, well, I guess it's always true if "inspirational material" can be literally anything, like my experiences hiking and camping (from which a lot of my fantasy travel color derives).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418924/#Comment_418924" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-23T18:43:04+00:00" title="July 23, 2013  6:43PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 23, 2013 7:04PM by komradebob.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Pantheon has secret point scoring post scenario, much like <i>Executive Decision </i>does. Actually, Executive Decision pretty much works exactly the same way.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.gregstolze.com/execdecis.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gregstolze.com/execdecis.html</a><br/><br/>Ron Edwards wrote one of the scenarios incidentally.<br/><br/>What I mean is, you play out the scenario. When it's over, only <b>then</b> do you get to look at a sheet that says : "Was your character the one that did [something genre related]? Score 5 points" or something along those lines.<br/><br/>So you aren't awarding me points and trying in those cases to beat me at the same exact time.<br/>____________<br/><br/>As for <i>inherently</i>...I took my best guess at phrasing that for emphasis. In practical terms, I accept that there's some nuance to that bit.<br/><br/>_______________<br/><br/>On a side note, I tend not to love competition or gaminess in RPGs and Story Games. I like <i>challenge</i>, but that's a bit of a subtle difference. This bias does impact my thinking about these things heavily.<br/><br/>Ok, let me put some emphasis there: <i>I like RPGs/SGs/Related stuff, primarily because they <b>aren't</b> One Winner Takes All styles of game.</i><br/><br/>I'm a dirty hippy child of the 70s. I'm completely okay with spreading social recognition and warm fuzzies around.<br/><br/>____________<br/><br/>I have noticed that people who play RPGs and SGs are verrrrrrry tender about the concept of other people making judgment calls on what they've contributed. Frankly, I was as well until I saw fan Mail in PTA, which caused me to reconsider the whole thing a bit. That may deserve a thread of its own though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager

For instance, if I have to award you either a black point or a white point after each [scene/task/whatever], I can be trusted to make that choice according to the rules of the game. Similarly, if I have to apply a certain number of points to various categories, but I have to spend all the points, that can be a robust system.<br/><br/>Here's another example: the GM judges the difficulty of an action based on their read of the fiction, and the higher the difficulty the more difficult the action. However, the difficulty number becomes the number of XPs awarded for the task.<br/><br/>There are probably much smarter ways to do this, as well.

You're the Poles in 1939? If you manage to do better than the historical results, you'll probably win as a player in a hex'n'chit type wargame, even if you lose in-fiction.<br/><br/>______<br/><br/>As an aside to something I mentioned a minute ago, I have actually played in competitive games where players voted on winners. In two different games, I managed to score a secondary MVP type award, even while losing the in-fiction win. One time it was a LARP, the other time it was a minis wargame ( where I led my team to an incredible disastrous defeat but managed to amuse the opposite side, so who knows...). Anyway, the point of that is that actualy, even in competitive games, you can actually get human judgment in there from opposing players/competitors without the thing becoming chaos.<br/><br/>Admittedly, it does help to have the overall group vibe being one where the fun is in the play of the game, more than the win. OTOH, that's mostly what I see in RPGS/SGs anyway, so I don't see it as a huge jump out into the unknown.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AaronF" title="AaronF"><img alt="AaronF" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nNH2FYNIYUOC3.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AaronF">AaronF</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418934/#Comment_418934" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-24T05:26:44+00:00" title="July 24, 2013  5:26AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry for coming back late.

Okay, let's go to the mechanics.<br/><br/>In [whateveritisI'mtalkingabut], it's more like: What outcomes are suggested by the source materials? Do we even feel the need to roll? If so, how to we weight the possible outcomes?<br/><br/>. . .<br/><br/>On a side note, I tend not to love competition or gaminess in RPGs and Story Games. I like <b>challenge</b>, but that's a bit of a subtle difference.</blockquote>I think this is important.  In most games, players apply their skills, which are challenged in some way by that game's particular demands and constraints.  In RPGs, that challenge can be provided by the rules, or the fiction, or the other players, or any combo of those.<br/><br/>Most physics-sim games strike me as an attempt to use rules to quantify and gamify the challenges presented by the fiction.  I think that's a large part of their appeal.  When they fail to satisfy that appeal, it's because the rules and the other players impact the challenge in other ways, from rules exploits like Peasant Railgun to player judgment calls like the GM not letting you roll.<br/><br/>Met with such failure, I think there's a spectrum of responses.  At one end is a desire for fewer judgment calls, and play supported by rules that refer to other rules rather than to nebulous fictional stuff.  At the other end is a desire for fewer fiction-independent rules incentives, and play supported by fiction-communication techniques that don't require gamey rules.  I think these ends of the spectrum tend to map roughly to "rules first" and "fiction first" play.  <br/><br/>Similarly, "fiction first" and "color first" often go together.<br/><br/>So I guess that's my take on "color-first vs physics-sim".  If you want play to be about fiction and color, you might actually seek out a physics-sim game for that reason!  If the fiction and color you like cares about physics issues*, and the rules model physics well, and your group has a clear agreement on how to apply the rules, then you might get exactly what you want!  But if not, you may then seek out something from the "freeform" or "rules-lite" or "genre emulation" families.<br/><br/>*So who likes fiction and color about physics issues?  Certainly not everyone, but I don't think it's a tiny niche either.  Many of us enjoy action/adventure fiction which challenges protagonists to problem-solve physically challenging situations.  We can also enjoy the color involved in detailed descriptions of character actions and scenarios, in games where those descriptions are always offered because they always matter.  Coen Brothers color in <i>Fiasco</i> is great too, but scratches a different itch (for me, anyway).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418975/#Comment_418975" name="Item_105" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-24T19:02:24+00:00" title="July 24, 2013  7:02PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very true, Dave.

Eventually I had to ditch the idea of "winning" and make the "good color" points redeemable for something that was also color-based (bonus scenes for showing off your villain's Master Plan).

Never with hardcore system-manipulation, though.

I like art. I've found a picture of a cool lion-headed guy.<br/><br/>I want to use that in the game, because, hey a lion-headed guy! How cool is that?<br/><br/>( In theory, it doesn't need to be an actual picture of a lion-headed guy that somebody else made. Maybe I've just got an internal picture in my head of a lion-headed guy. In a way, there's no difference, except maybe I suck at drawing, so I'll describe the lion-headed guy instead of showing my players a picture.)<br/><br/>Anyway, the lion-headed guy. He's color. Color first. As a priority.<br/><br/>Chronologically, he's also first. He's what I'm starting from.<br/><br/>Now if I understand correctly, he becomes a causal agent as soon as the color impacts the fiction that gets wrapped around him. The fact that he's a lion-headed guy gives me all sorts of ideas for how he acts and how I portray him. He roars. Maybe he's threatening or kingly.<br/><br/>When I present that image to the players, chronological, priority, and causal agent will be coming together also. Again, it doesn't matter what form the image takes, whether words or actual picture on a sheet of paper.<br/><br/><br/>So, with the map, maybe it helps to think of it first as an image. Think of it as an overhead image of the space the scene takes place in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419256/#Comment_419256" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-30T14:14:38+00:00" title="July 30, 2013  2:14PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2013 2:21PM by komradebob.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry, this is hard for me to put into words.<br/><br/>This is Mos Eisley:<br/><a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=&amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fstarwars.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FMos_Eisley&amp;h=0&amp;w=0&amp;sz=1&amp;tbnid=njm4qpiyjekyyM&amp;tbnh=146&amp;tbnw=345&amp;zoom=1&amp;docid=fi5Xy8nMQaagjM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Lyz4UYHpFZLQ8wTWt4GwCA&amp;ved=0CAIQsCU#imgdii=njm4qpiyjekyyM%3A%3BLtPz4HP0L-GAJM%3Bnjm4qpiyjekyyM%3A" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=&amp;amp;imgrefurl=http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mos_Eisley&amp;amp;h=0&amp;amp;w=0&amp;amp;sz=1&amp;amp;tbnid=njm4qpiyjekyyM&amp;amp;tbnh=146&amp;amp;tbnw=345&amp;amp;zoom=1&amp;amp;docid=fi5Xy8nMQaagjM&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=Lyz4UYHpFZLQ8wTWt4GwCA&amp;amp;ved=0CAIQsCU#imgdii=njm4qpiyjekyyM:;LtPz4HP0L-GAJM;njm4qpiyjekyyM:</a><br/><br/>It's pretty clear that someone is using this one as a map in a very traditional gamer way.

I have it too.<br/><br/>If I was at two different tables, one where a GM showed me the second picture and one where a GM had set up the stuff in the first picture, I would have two very different reactions.<br/><br/>Previous play experience as a gamer has taught me that a GM showing me picture two is setting up a general way for us all to get on a similar page when envisioning the place.<br/><br/>Previous play experience has taught me that a GM setting up the layout in picture one means we're going to be playing out a battle with little toy men.<br/><br/>Now here's the thing: If you aren't a gamer with the same prior gaming experiences, will you inherently have the same reactions ?<br/><br/>I suspect you might have some of them, but not nearly to the same degree or with the same amount of clear mental division. <br/><br/>For example, I wouldn't expect a non-gamer to immediately think of the layout as only being useful for tactical doings. I would expect that to be a common reaction from a gamer. <br/><br/>IOW, I would expect a gamer to self-impose more limits on the use of that layout as color than a non-gamer even if that wasn't actually required or even the point.<br/><br/>I mean, if I went to my Uncle's house at Christmas time, pointed my finger at his little Christmas village layout (with all of the little people and snowmen and horse-drawn sleighs and what not), and told my non-gamer relatives: "hey, we're going to play a game and make up stories about this place and the people there!" I'd expect all kinds of stuff inspired by what was actually there. the color-first stuff.<br/><br/>If I did the same thing with gamers, someone would immediately be asking what the damage value of a snowball was, if they were more dangerous when enfilading the carolers' position, and how fast a sleigh moves over open street versus snowy grass, and how that compared to Tiny Tim's crutch-based movement rate.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419268/#Comment_419268" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-30T17:57:07+00:00" title="July 30, 2013  5:57PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're some serious hardcore gamers.
