Well, back in March I was all excited about it, and had a game idea and everything. But I had a convention to run at the same time, and I was so knackered afterwards I fluffed the deadline. Who'd a thought? But I haven't given up on the idea, which I thought was a good one, so I'm hoping you could all give me some comments, critiscisms and general pointers to get my ass moving and actually write this thing.<br/><br/>The premise: This is to be a fun, one session wonder, based around the idea of building characters through conversations. The characters are in the calm before the storm, the darkest hours just before dawn, as they say, and will soon face some major event. The players will, in the first part of the game, tell stories and anecdotes (a like Munchausen but as a group), and derive from these stories the attributes of their characters, who are passing the time until their doom arrives. In the second half of the story, well, the doom arrives; day dawns and strife occurs, and he newly fleshed out characters have to face it.<br/><br/>The basis is a character with 4 stats: Strength, Charm, Combat and Morality. The character sheet also has room for traits that fall under these stats. When rolling dice, you roll a d10 per point in stat, and add one per level in trait you possess, trying to get over 9. Traits max at 3.<br/><br/>The initial incarnation of the game went like this:<br/>Part I:<br/>1. Each person gets a purse of coins. Say, 15.<br/>2. Each person describes a scene for the person to their left, in the style of "Hey, do you remember that time when..." or "I heard there was this thing that happened to you at..." or whatever. Basic scene framing.<br/>3. The main character, aided by his friends, tells a short anecdote about that event.<br/>4. At some point during that anecdote, the main player can call for a critical conflict, wherein they claim to have certain attributes. They use their purse to pay for the attributes they think they have, levels in traits and extra points in stats.<br/>5. the player then rolls the dice they think they have. If they succeed, they were correct and get to keep the stat. If they fail, they would instead gain a negative trait, which makes related rolls harder.<br/>6. The story is finished off, with relation to the trait actually gained (possibly the negative trait is only defined after the anecdote is over, and is based on the outcome of the failure)<br/>7. Continue until all coins are used up.<br/><br/>Part II: Um, I have no idea. I got stuck here, not sure whether this game could be dynamic enough without a GM. A climactic chase sequence, French Nobles fleeing from Peasants through the halls of their own Ch\xc3\xa2teau, naval galleons at war, high school football matches even, it was all a bit hard for me to work out how to take what was, in essence, a very standard character sheet, and make it work without a GM - but it was quite obvious that the first half doesn't need  GM. So I tried again:<br/><br/>New game system! Dice are still rolled based on the stats, but the difficulty is set lower, because traits no longer alter it. Instead, traits are set for the players ahead of time. No reason why they can't come up with their own, I suppose, but for easy of use, I was going to provide a sort of 'deck' of traits. Not really more than bits of pre-printed paper, each one would have a trait name and a modifier to the basic stat. So you could have "Voice of an Angel - Charm +1" or "Loyal unto Death- Morality +2". You can take a certain number of points of traits (points being the amount of the modifiers), as before in the course of a story you tell.<br/><br/>Big change: every time you gain a trait, you have to provide a plot point for the pool from your tale. So if you gained the trait "World's Best Duellist - Combat +2", you might also throw in "The swordmaster who trained me, who I had to defeat in combat to gain my title - 4".the level of the plot thing is twice the level of the trait you gained.<br/><br/>The second half now goes like this:<br/>1. Like in the first half, each player takes a turn to frame a scene, using a plot point from the pool as a central hook.<br/>2. Each one picks a trait, and each one tries to defeat it. Trait is effectively gambled, only the winner (highest roller?) gets to keep their trait, but each person has to chose a different stat/approach. (Wow, only just thought of that, its much less lame than the previous idea). The losers throw away their spent trait cards.<br/>3. The party anecdotes about the scene and how the trait is used, preferably as a group again.<br/>4. continue until either no more plot points, or no more traits. Anyone with traits left when the plot runs out escapes the doom.<br/><br/>So, there's my idea. The game is currently looking to be written from the point of view of the French nobles concept, with additional setting ideas included, and if I went with the whole cards thing, I'd be looking to provide free templates to make up your own cards, and loads of alternate setting decks, gratis. Anyone want to criticise it real hard and make me cry? Please?<br/><br/>Shevaun                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100461/#Comment_100461" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T11:30:38+00:00" title="October  2, 2007 11:30AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2007 11:31AM by Joe Murphy.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So are some traits bargains, or do they all cost similar amounts? Bargains could be one way to push certain stories and make people fight over crucial stuff.<br/><br/><i>Is</i> the first phase competitive?

Will part of the fun be gluing together disparate traits (I'm a duellist <i>and</i> peasant wtf?) or will it be easier than that?<br/><br/>In the second half, do you take a plot point and frame for another player, or yourself?

So the "Kung Fu! Combat +2" trait would cost 2 points. The trade off is, you only have a set number of points to spend, and while good traits may be used for combat, they're also your 'hit points'. And I was thinking of making there be only a limited number of traits to chose from at any one time. Say, deal twice the number of players-worth from the trait deck, and replace each one when its taken.<br/><br/>The first round wasn't going to be competitive, though what with the second half becoming increasingly so the more I talk about it, perhaps I shall do that. What about, each player gets to tell his story, with group participation, and at the end the rest of the players get to chose which trait he gets from the pool? That way, you can try to angle your story towards a ceratin triat, but other people can butt in and derail your tale? <br/><br/>The plot points are used by each player in turn to frame a scene for everybody, I think, in that it could have originated from any one player, but everyone is involved in the scene as described. The plot level would, in effect, become a kind of challenge rating, though now I think about it, there'd be no real reason to double the rating. Um, though since there's no GM, I guess the level of the trait should have more to do with the difficulty of everyone else's dice rolls. More thinking required there.<br/><br/>I'll have a go at re-writing the opening post later on - its full of half formed ideas and is pretty unclear about what I'm asking you guys to do, so sorry about that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hoog" title="hoog"><img alt="hoog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hoog">hoog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100494/#Comment_100494" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T12:17:23+00:00" title="October  2, 2007 12:17PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm no game designer, but here's my two cents anyway...<br/><br/>I like the part where you make up your character and his stats through anecdotes<br/><br/>but I don't like that you can actually fail in that part and not get the stats you want<br/><br/>that seems deprotagonizing to me<br/><br/>it's like "oh, I know, I'll make this character that runs really fast... roll... oh, no, wait, he's a cripple apparently"<br/><br/>I think it might be better if the first part was just straight buying stats<br/><br/>seems to me like the second part is all about failing in cool ways (or at least that the possibility is there)<br/><br/>I mean, char-gen is like the only part of RPGs where you have total control, as a player<br/><br/>unless you are deliberately going for that "play the character you rolled up no matter what" kind of feel, as in some trad RPGs<br/><br/>does that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100510/#Comment_100510" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-02T12:50:08+00:00" title="October  2, 2007 12:50PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, hoog.

The Type 1 was based on the buying traits with coins, made up during the course of the anecdote, with the chance of losing. In the Type 2 play, traits are pre-described on a deck of cards. Each part marked with a question mark is a bit where I have made some sort of arbitrary decision which I'm not sure about, and each part where there are multiple options (either a, b &amp; c, or separated by slashes), I haven't decided which one is to be used yet. Oh, and the bits which say Optional are also potential extra rules which might help, still to be decided on.<br/><br/><b>Part 1:</b><br/>1. Deal a number of cards from the trait deck equal to twice(?) the number of players, face up, into the middle of the table.<br/>2. Randomly determine the starting player. This player then secretly chooses a trait they want from the pool(?).<br/>3. The person to their right then challenges them by framing a scene, based on a shared memory or rumour. The scene must revolve around the player whose turn it is.<br/>4. All the players then chat about this memory, telling the tale anecdotally. Whenever people disagree about what happened, majority rules, the player whose turn it is braking ties.<br/>5a. After the story comes to a suitably humourous or dramatic finish, the other players then decide amongst them which trait they think the main character should be awarded.<br/>5b. At the end of the tale, the main player then reveals which trait they wanted from the story, and the other players decide amongst themselves whether they did. Majority rules, main player breaks ties (though doesn't get a vote himself).<br/>5c. The character reveals which trait he's going for from the start, and other players help frame a scene around that.  At the critical moment in the tale, the main player then gets to roll the trait (dice pool=trait rating, success if any die comes up 8 or higher) as if he had it, and if succeeds, gets it. If not, has to choose another trait of a different type and describes how it applies to the scene resolution/the other players choose the trait and he has to describe how the scene finishes based on that.<br/>6. Each character can have a total of 12 (?) points of traits, and each trait will have a rating of no more than (3?).<br/>7. Each time a player gains a trait, they must also add a plot element to the pool, based on the scene just narrated. The plot element has a rating equal to a) the level of the trait gained (if plot element roles dice too b) twice the level of the trait gained (if people work together to defeat it) or c) 5 plus the trait level (if that\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the difficulty of the roll to defeat it).<br/>8. Once all players have maxed out on traits, part 1 ends.<br/><br/><b>Part 2:</b><br/>1. The big climactic end sequence starts \xe2\u20ac\u201c chariot race, naval warfare, storming the occult nazi temple, escaping from the ravening mob of French peasants, etc.<br/>2. Each player takes a turn framing a scene based around a plot point from the pool.<br/>3. Each player decides how they are going to attempt to overcome the plot point, using their various traits, and describes what they think should happen when they do.<br/>\tOptional: each player has to use a different trait type (only works for 4 player games)<br/>4. Each player rolls dice equal to their trait rating/the rating of all their traits of that type combined. Each die they roll over the difficulty of the plot element is a success/each die they roll higher than 7 is a success, and they must equal or beat the number of successes the plot element rolls.<br/>5. Each player that succeeds at all, keeps their trait; each player that fails loses their trait. The scene must then be described between everyone with relevance to how each person contributes to defeating the plot or succumbs to it.<br/>6. If any player runs out of traits, they are no longer in the group \xe2\u20ac\u201c they have died, been lost, are off the team, lost overboard, whatever is appropriate. <br/>Optional: That player then gets to be the main scene-setter, until the next person dies, wherein they both get to, until eventually its all the players pitting the world against theone who has lasted the longest.<br/>\tOptional: If a player is about to get knocked out, any other player can sacrifice a trait to keep them in. This may result in them getting knocked out instead. How very noble.<br/>6. Each player takes a turn, keeping it all dramatic and stuff, until the very end (unless above option is taken). Once the last plot point is defeated, the last remaining characters, if there are any, get away, win etc. A quick description of the final moments, and then everyone cheers! If everyone loses, then a quick description of the last, noble moments when fate descends on them, and then everyone drinks to their lost characters. Or something.<br/><br/>Better?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_100653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100653/#Comment_100653" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-03T06:14:14+00:00" title="October  3, 2007  6:14AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.<br/><br/>There's an elegance to how the players choose traits in the first section, and add plot to the second.
