There was a question about how much of the setting I'm running was pitched to the players, created collaboratively, established in play procedurally, established in play through just spoutin' off ideas, etc.<br/><br/><b>Here's what we know, after two sessions:</b><br/><br/>The oceans flooded up, consuming much of the world. Canada stretches from the Rockies to the edge of Ontario, now. Aside from the small island of Quebec, everything else is submerged. Those who survived, climbed. Our group of PCs is part of a small group that lives in a reclaimed summer camp. There's a few cabins, a mess hall, some ominous concrete bathroom complexes, a dock on the water, and forest surrounding.<br/><br/>Gin is a symbol of power. If you are in power, you get lots of gin. As a result, Millions was drunk all of the time and was a shitty leader. But whoever put an unstable 16 year old (who has a cripple/freak fetish, for what it's worth) in charge was making a bad decision in the first place. Millions has been deposed. Grome has been shot. Rum &amp; Roarke were put in charge, by Berg. Now Roarke's dead and lots of people are lookin' to pin that on Berg.<br/><br/>There's a crazy group that's moved out of the cabins, and into a makeshift tent city just outside of the camp limits. They bathe in mud and ash, and dance naked, and Dog Head is their leader. Weird anarcho-hedonists. They recently stole and slaughtered one of the camp's two cows, because the mud people taught Dog Head how to distill crude alcohol out of blood. Now, their cheap alcohol source is further destabilizing the camp's power source.<br/><br/>On the other side of the lake, there is a larger village. They have wheat and other grain crops there. There are occasional hermits who live alone in the woods, which seems to be an ideal location if you're an inventor or researcher of some sort. Far away, there is a city.<br/><br/>A bike gang roams the woods. They're new to the area, and they're stirring shit up. One's a brainer, and he tortured a dog and left it tied up to a fallen tree. This gang, they want to expand their turf, and that means debilitating both the village and the camp's military strength (which consists of, for the camp, about six guns in the hands of about eight guys).<br/><br/>You can re-animate the dead. You can enter the minds of dead people, even if they're dismembered and scattered about the forest floor. Creepy.<br/><br/><br/><i>In a moment, I'll post about how we got to all of those facts.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275422/#Comment_275422" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-10T18:11:11+00:00" title="June 10, 2010  6:11PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, before I unpack how we arrived at those setting facts, I want to mention something fun:<br/><br/><i>It's interesting to watch different people gravitate to different things in Apocalypse World. Everyone at my current table identifies as poly, gay or genderqueer (or some combo). Seeing what our perspectives highlight in the system is neat. At least one of the players chose their role based on the gender options it listed.</i><br/><br/><b>Okay, here's what we prepped and pitched beforehand:</b><br/><br/>1.) Originally, we were going to do a zombie apocalypse thing. And then after pitching the game more thoroughly and presenting the role books, they changed their minds. Cool, zombie apocalypse was out... but I also kept in the back of my mind that Noelle liked zombies, and when the situation presented itself I introduced them: Noelle (playing Brace, the Brainer) wanted to know if she could deep brain scan a dead person. That's when I sketched out and introduced the custom move:<br/><br/><b>When You Scan The Dead...</b><br/>You first need to breathe life back into them. Roll +weird.<br/>On a 10+, you breathe life back into them momentarily, and hold 3.<br/>On a 7-9, choose:<br/>you breathe life back into them permanently, and hold 3.<br/>you breathe some of your life into them temporarily (I get to make a move), and hold 3.<br/>Hold gets spent just like in Deep Brain Scans.<br/>On a 6 or less, your scan fails, but whether the resuscitation works is up to me.<br/><br/>2.) So, with zombies out, I needed something. Amy said that it would be cool to have the game focus on some kind of ecological destruction, like in Resident Evil: Extinction. I suggested a mostly-flooded world, and this sounded rad to everyone.<br/><br/>3.) While they were picking out roles, I asked "how about, then, if you guys are in some mountain summer camp?" They nodded, and I spent their character generation time sketching out the camp, and the lake, and the dock.<br/><br/>They finished up their characters, and told me about them:<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brace</span><br/>Brace was trained as a surgeon, but began using their surgical knowledge to perform brain scans and intrusive psychic experiments. Despite the profession, Brace is a germaphobe and extremely concerned with neatness and cleanliness. Brace wears a full suit at all times.<br/><br/>At this point I interjected to say, "Do you carry an umbrella, to deal with the inky rains in The Black Season?"<br/>Noelle nodded.<br/><br/>This was a detail I interjeted on the spot, about the seasons and the ink.<br/>It was lifted from an example in the text, basically.<br/>I didn't plan this or even think of it beforehand... I was following principles: <i>ask questions constantly</i>, <i>barf forth apocalyptica</i>, <i>respond with fuckery</i> ("oh, you dress nice? how do you look covered in fucking ink four months a year?")<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Berg</span><br/>Berg is a drifter and a grifter. Operator. Dresses slick as well, in old timesy suits. Boyish in appearance.<br/><br/>We run some gigs as a pre-play thing: scavenging and bartering.<br/>Scavenging is a success, bartering is a failure.<br/><br/>"Alright, so you manage to get those parts for The Rabble, and now they officially owe you a favour... but the bartering... well, what did you need from that chemist guy in the woods? Lactaise, to help you digest cow's milk? Sweet. Well, Jackaback's dead, and his lab has been ransacked. No more lactaise for you."<br/><br/>That was all the prep we did, and all of the discussions we had before play began.<br/>We opened with Berg stumbling across Jackaback's bloody body, and the angry words SI-ENS KILLS scrawled across his wall in his blood.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275426/#Comment_275426" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-10T18:29:13+00:00" title="June 10, 2010  6:29PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, all your stylin' characters -- you need to have a session where they roll over an abandoned Thrift Store or something.<br/><br/>Am I correct in my reading that one of your characters is lactose-intolerant, and that this became a significant part of the fiction?

Berg goes back to Brace, the Brainer. "Brace, there's a dead guy in the woods. Can you... read dead people."<br/>Noelle flips to the Deep Brain Scan move, and glances up at me, unsure about her authority in this decision.<br/><br/>I rephrase the question, to something more ominous and exploitable: "Your call, Noelle. Can Brainers reach their minds beyond the grave?"<br/>Noelle answers yes, and I get to sketching out that custom move <i>When You Scan the Dead</i>...<br/><br/>Noelle had originally leaned towards a zombie apoc scenario, and while we changed our minds, I still remembered that she liked the idea of zombies.<br/>And so my rephrasing of that question, and the specific details of the scan-the-dead move... they were tailored to open up the opportunity for zombies in the setting.<br/><br/>In general, when they wanted something that would fuck them over, I gave it to them without contest.<br/>Like when Amy says, "So, since Roarke confiscated Berg's gun, he can just convince someone else to lend him their gun, right?"...<br/>My immediate reaction was "going behind Roarke's back and packing secret heat? that'll be such a clusterfuck. How can I give Amy what is wanted, here?"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>2.) While Brace was resuscitating Jackaback's corpse, by breathing some of Brace's own life force into Jackaback's mouth... Berg decides to get the fuck out of that freak show and go for a walk. I toss out the idea that there's a dog whimpering in the distance. Eventually, Berg comes upon a dog that's tied up to a fallen tree. Berg circles, cautiously, and I remind Amy that there's the Read A Charged Situation move. They roll it.<br/><br/><i>"Where is my enemy's true position?"</i><br/>I respond, but misdirect, to make it look like the answer's coming directly from the fiction.<br/><br/>"Well, you are standing next to some bike treads. Like, motor bikes. Which is odd, because you haven't seen any bikes at the village. In each of those tread grooves, there's a small amount of ink. Which, I dunno, to me implies that they were put down before the rain this morning."<br/><br/>"So, they're long gone?"<br/>"Yeah. And the tracks lead off in the direction of the village, sort of."<br/><br/>So, that's where the bike gang came from. I improvised them based on needing a good way to misdirect "Where is my enemy's true position?"<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>3.) When I introduced Millions as a drunk teenager, I needed some way to justify her as camp leader. Oh, gin equals power. Perfect! Now, her drunkenness is a sign of power, instead of just a sign that she's unsuitable for leadership.<br/><br/>That wasn't born out of a move or a principle or anything, really. I just felt that it was weird that I put a drunk in charge, and then I let myself wonder about that one for a while, and then I had an answer. Oh, actually, that is a principle. <i>Leave yourself things to wonder about</i>.<br/><br/><br/><br/>4.) Millions has a thing for freaks. Like, she's fucked every cripple in camp. Where did that come from?<br/><br/>Well, Brace was trying to convince Millions to grant permission for Brace to deep brain scan Kettle, one of Million's lieutenants.<br/>Brace has a shitty hot, but a really good weird, and Unnatural Lust Transfixion.<br/>And so Noelle is looking for an excuse to make this a seduction roll, so that she can roll +weird.<br/><br/>Brace raises one neat eyebrow and whispers, "I'll let you watch."<br/>I nod. And then I make up the backstory about how Millions has fucked every cripple in the camp, and how Brace is exotic and alluring to her.<br/>Brace rolls an 8 on that roll, +2 weird, for an amazing success.<br/>Not only does Millions want to watch, she wants to have the memories transfered into her head, and she gives a lot of power to Brace in that exchange.<br/><i>Respond with intermittent rewards</i>.<br/><br/>This one also set me up nicely to <i>Respond with fuckery</i> down the line, when Millions shows up at Brace's door late at night, strung out, deposed of power, sober for the first time since she took to power, screaming that she'll shoot the door down if Brace doesn't open up. And then she wastes the rest of their rifle ammo trying to shoot out Brace's lock.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275430/#Comment_275430" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-10T18:42:09+00:00" title="June 10, 2010  6:42PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ice Cream Emperor</cite>Am I correct in my reading that one of your characters is lactose-intolerant, and that this became a significant part of the fiction?

He was one of The Purists. He tried to contest Berg, at gunpoint, and got shot dead.<br/><br/>Over the next week, I wrote two fronts:<br/><b>Unstable Power Dynamics in Camp</b> (Dog Head is brewing crude alcohol, Millions wants to reclaim power, The Purists want to drive The Rabble out)<br/><b>Dustwich's Conquest</b> (Dustwich is patrolling the woods, Torture victims, Invasion looming)<br/><br/>When Berg and Brace wanted to leave camp and flee early on in the second session, I <i>did what my prep demanded</i>: kept throwing them barriers and stalls, so that they wouldn't just walk out on my prep and leave me stranded.<br/>And near the end of that second session, I let up on the circumstances, making it possible for them to flee <i>when it worked for my prep</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275566/#Comment_275566" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T10:52:09+00:00" title="June 11, 2010 10:52AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>When Berg and Brace wanted to leave camp and flee early on in the second session, I<i>did what my prep demanded</i>: kept throwing them barriers and stalls, so that they wouldn't just walk out on my prep and leave me stranded.<br/>And near the end of that second session, I let up on the circumstances, making it possible for them to flee<i>when it worked for my prep</i>.</blockquote>\nNice. When we played our first session I made the town enough of a shithole so that they also wanted to leave, the results were similar to what you did, but not handled as straightforward. This is a great piece of advice. During the session, stick to your prep but let it run towards the end of the session so you can prep for the next one based on that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275572/#Comment_275572" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-11T11:03:43+00:00" title="June 11, 2010 11:03AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 11, 2010 11:04AM by John_Harper.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another way to stick to the prep is to use the map.

Having played in an AW one-shot that you ran, I knew the brilliance of the MAP AS WORLD approach.<br/>But I also made it clear that the rest of the world would come flooding in soon enough... seeing as it was going to be a multi-session game.<br/><br/>So, I was in a place where I needed to keep Berg &amp; Brace with these people in this camp, at least a little longer.<br/>That wasn't hard. I'd designed my fronts to accomodate.<br/><br/>There was a Threat that put the camp into lockdown.<br/>There was another Threat that made the woods unsafe.<br/><br/>All I had to do was pull them out in tandem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275758/#Comment_275758" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-12T18:56:01+00:00" title="June 12, 2010  6:56PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2010 6:59PM by Paul_T.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe,<br/><br/>It's really fun to read how you put the various advice and principles into action. How much of that would you say was prompted by the AW text and rules, and how much of it is stuff you'd feel pretty comfortable doing on your own, using your own creativity and experience?<br/><br/>Like, in play how often were you sitting there thinking, "Cool, I can run this using my skills and experience", and how often did you find yourself thinking, "Whoa! I would never have done that/said this/GMed this way if not for [something in the game]"?<br/><br/>Put a slightly different way, how often were you thinking "have to [do X, as mandated by text] now" compared to, "looking back, I can see I [did X, as mandated by text]?"<br/><br/>If you don't feel like you can answer that honestly, that's OK, too. It's a hard question! <br/><br/>I'm curious, because so much of AW's advice sounds like "stuff I already do" to many people, and I'm curious which bits feel comfortable to you as a GM, and which bits were a surprise or a struggle. Which bits are a good rewording of GM techniques you already use, and which things you struggled with, or which changed your approach to running the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_275761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275761/#Comment_275761" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-12T19:42:52+00:00" title="June 12, 2010  7:42PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>It's really fun to read how you put the various advice and principles into action.

You can take your time and muck about."<br/>When I wanted to come down on the players when they fucked up, I hesitated.<br/>And then Apocalypse World said, "Dude, that's your <i>job</i>. They're going to love you for it. Do it!"<br/><br/>When I wanted to say "yeah, you can do that, but it'll probably fuck you up down the road," Apocalypse World was there with all the details: how to give them permission, how to codify that fucking up, even how to spin it so it looked good.<br/><br/>At every turn, AW gave me permission to do the things I already knew how to do, and made them easier to do by handing me all the nitty-gritty details.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_275818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/275818/#Comment_275818" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-13T12:07:58+00:00" title="June 13, 2010 12:07PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice, Joe.<br/><br/>That's exactly the impression I got from reading everything you'd written about the game so far; it's nice to see my hunch wasn't far off!<br/><br/>This is a good thread for people looking to play AW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
