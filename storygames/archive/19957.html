I'm about to start running a 3:16 game, and I've noticed that the rulebook seems to have some implied assumptions about the setting that my setting violates. I thought that I'd ask whether there's anything in particular that should be taken into account when changing those assumptions.<br/><br/>From the rules, one gets the impression that the game is supposed to be run as what's essentially a set of unconnected missions, with the human troopers being the only thing in common between them. For example, "play the game by going through the list of aliens one by one" means that each planet will have a different kind of alien - there's no mention of recurring enemies or any implication of there being any vast alien empire to combat. Just a set of separate alien species to be squashed one at a time. Also, the only mention of possible human enemies comes in the form of fallen marines: basically it seems like there's just one human empire that's basically internally united.<br/><br/>Another assumption that I notice is that each planet is assumed to have basically just one kind of alien.<br/><br/>I was thinking of tweaking those assumptions a bit. The setting I came up with basically has a mixture of one-planet aliens, beast-like aliens that move from world to world (think the Alien xenomorphs), as well as larger alien empires, some of which are manipulating the lesser races behind the scenes. So an unlucky squad of troopers might be taking it easy on an AA 4 world and enjoying a well-deserved straightforward xenocide of a defenseless alien species that never did anything wrong, only to find out that the whole species was just a diversion for the AA 10 mastermind aliens who suddenly pop up with (number of players) threat tokens of their own and do not appreciate having been found out.<br/><br/>Another tweak would be that in addition to the alien species, there are a number of traitor colonies which Terra is struggling to keep in check, some of which may be secretly allied with the aliens. As the game begins, none of the player characters have yet encountered a member of an alien species before - all of their pre-campaign kills are from missions fought against the traitor colonies, before they were transferred to the Expeditionary Fleet. The fleet's responsibility to eradicate alien life may occasionally bring it back to contact with human traitors that are aiding the aliens.<br/><br/>I'm wondering if there's anything in particular to keep in mind when changing these assumptions. The one thing that immediately comes to mind is that the "going bug-hunting from planet to planet" setup from the original rules seems to be designed to make it more obvious that the whole war is pointless, and that the humans are just genocidal oppressors bent on destroying all life even if that life posed no real threat to them. That assumption seems to be undermined in a setting where there actually are malevolent enemies that genuinely threaten humanity. On the other hand, this could be easily worked around by making it so that the humans are the original aggressors, and that most of the other races would have been peaceful if they hadn't been attacked first.<br/><br/>Is there anything else I should take into account?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441305/#Comment_441305" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-10T15:40:49+00:00" title="January 10, 2015  3:40PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is all very interesting. You're definitely correct about the point of the game's default assumptions, which makes me feel less nervous about your decision to change them. My concern, however, is that without that emergent thematic morality play thing, the game may not have enough going for it to maintain player interest. It is, after all, quite simple. You won't break the game by springing different tokens on them part-way through a mission, though. I'm working on a Clone Wars hack that is going to use this idea, with different-colored tokens for different types of droids.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441309/#Comment_441309" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-10T17:29:58+00:00" title="January 10, 2015  5:29PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The one thing that immediately comes to mind is that the "going bug-hunting from planet to planet" setup from the original rules seems to be designed to make it more obvious that the whole war is pointless, and that the humans are just genocidal oppressors bent on destroying all life even if that life posed no real threat to them.

Sorry to be so "me too" when D already nailed it so let me add this:<br/>You can also have recurring threads and meta-conflicts with the human Earth brass in between the missions. Maybe that firefighting game Morningstar did could be an inspiration there. Except you use NFA for everything.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441315/#Comment_441315" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-10T22:20:04+00:00" title="January 10, 2015 10:20PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The real meat of the game is the player interactions / in-fighting.
