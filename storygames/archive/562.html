<p>I'd actually like to hear the arguments for saying that a story needs to end.  It was pretty off-topic for the previous thread, but right on-topic for this one.</p>
<p>Like ... <em>Spiderman</em> ... from his first appearance to present day can be viewed as one long story.  It can also be viewed as being comprised of smaller stories, breaking down to the level of scenes or even panels.  I've seen panels in comic books in which I can point to a beginning, middle and end.</p>
<p>I guess I'm wondering what principle people follow in looking at that long, continuous river of narrative and breaking it into chunks.</p>

                            This sounds kinda like the Coffee House Philosopher talk. "What is Justice?" "What is Love?" * etc. I don't think we'll come to a consensus, even without going all Socratic Method and all. I'm wondering (and this isn't moderation or anything, just a thought from a pragmatic philosopher) if it wouldn't be better to take this to LJ, come up with your own definition that works for you, then come back and talk about exactly how it relates to specific events in your gaming.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/><i>* Baby don't hurt me.

                            Heya,<br/>
<br/>
Sounds good, Andy.  On Socratic Design I call "story" for RPGs "the sequence of in-game events."  Let's start the debate there.  Thoughts on that definition, guys?<br/>

                            My definition: A story is the narrative of a premise running its course.<br/>
<br/>
Definition of premise: there are actually a couple of different types. There's the "A leads to B" premise (such as, "Greed leads to suffering" or "Humility leads to redemption"), there's the "A vs. B" premise ("Fraternal love triumphs over romantic love"), and there's the situational premise ("War does x, y and z to people", or "Being locked up under stress does x, y and z to people").<br/>
<br/>
The premise running its course means, the narrative shows how that little sentence turns out to be true. In RPGs, it'll be framed as a question, becase you haven't actually decided how it'll turn out yet. But once you do, you get from the starting premise ("Loyalty vs. Greed") to the final premise when it's run its course ("Loyalty triumphs over greed").<br/>
<br/>
Notice that the premise is NOT universal. You're not saying that loyalty always triumphs over greed. You're saying that here, in this story, you're showing one instance in which loyalty triumphs over greed.<br/>
<br/>
That's why there need to be conclusions. The premise question needs to be answered.<br/>
<br/>
You can go on and on with the narrative, but if you're not setting out to explore and play out a premise, you're not focused on creating a story.<br/>
<br/>
Note again: This is my personal definition, your definition of "narrative" and "story" are most likely different.                        </div>

                            I'm mostly curious to see what people think, so this is more poll than talking points, to my mind.  I should have made that a little more clear in the OP.<br/>
<br/>
For me, a story is a conflict or set of conflicts that are resolved through a series of events.  In a game, that's usually (player) characters resolving a set of conflicts through their actions.  Stories end when all the conflicts are resolved, and I think games should, too.  Which is not to say that a game can't go on indefinitely -- it just needs to create new conflicts as quickly as it resolves old ones.                        </div>

                            A story is basically life. Well, not exactly. Story is an art form that resembles life and looks a lot like it, but is not actually life. There's a phrase in visual arts, I think that means "to fool the eye" or something like that. Story does that too. It looks an awful lot like life but it's no more life that the Mona Lisa is a woman.                        </div>

                            I think it's a story. I also think it's an unbelievably boring story.<br/>
<br/>
All a story really is, in its simplest form, is a series of things that happen.<br/>
<br/>
But most people will find that boring, unless they're the four year old who's telling it.<br/>
<br/>
What makes a story compelling? That's different. I think it requires people or situations that either the audience can relate to or that the audience is curious about.<br/>
<br/>
You pretty much need a conflict, too, or else you have a the above example, but with more detail.                        </div>

                            Ah, so what we want to talk about is not "what's a story" but "what makes a compelling story" This is a much more useful question. Because anyone can write a story like Bill's story above. No, really. Check any fanfic site. But creating a compelling story, that's what we really want, right?<br/>
<br/>
So how does one make people or situations that either the audience can relate to or that the audience is curious about. And what does that mean? And what is conflict?                        </div>

                            The following elements tend to make stories more compelling, in my opinion:<br/>
- active protagonist driven by ruling passion<br/>
- obstacles that keep the protagonist from realizing the passion<br/>
- story questions; i.e., make me curious about what happens next. In the long run, that'll be: What's the price the protagonist will pay in order to realize hir passion? But in each scene, each chapter, there should be a question posed and answered<br/>
- sympathy with the protagonist; redeeming qualities, flaws, humanity<br/>
- internal conflict of the protagonist; tough choices<br/>
There are more, but those are on top of my mind right now.                        </div>

                            I'll just throw in two cents that the main thing which makes a story compelling is good execution.  Most bad stories still have all the necessary structural elements.  They have obstacles, theme (often glaring and/or moralizing), internal conflict, etc.  You can break down a Dick and Jane book into the Campbells Hero's Journey.  <br/>
<br/>
What makes a difference for me is in how good each of the pieces are.  How well-realized are the characters?  How fluid is the prose, or how smooth the photography and editing?  How well thought-out is the plot?  How detailed is the background?  etc.                        </div>

                            The classic story diagram involves something like this:<br/>
<br/>
Introduce a conflict. Jackie's old boyfriend is in town, and his co-workers are all wondering if she's gonna go see him.<br/>
<br/>
Add complications. Jackie's married, and she doesn't know how her husband would feel, because man, the story was they were a serious couple back them. Plus, she has to work a double shift. The last time she saw him it was a really unhappy thing. And so on, layered one after another.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, add everything Christian says above about sympathy. Not only does Jackie's story have to be interesting, but she has to be appealing somehow. <br/>
<br/>
If I were writing a story about, her, I'd maybe think about stuff in my own life that's hard, or stuff that my friends think is hard. Like maybe she really hates her job, and she remembers how her old boyfriend told her she'd never get off her ass and find a job she liked. Now you're like, man, I want Jackie to feel good about herself, because I hate my job too, and my mom keeps asking when I'm gonna finish school, or whatever.                        </div>

                            You know, personally, I've had a hell of a time researching what story is because most of the books I had read (or tried to read) on the subject either confused the issue by wasting time with sentece structure and grammar and crap like that (If you didn't get a working knowledge of this stuff by third grade English class, you ain't getting it) or it would describe aspects of story in ways that really didn't make things any clearer. Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_structure" rel="nofollow">Freytag's shark fin</a>. Stuff that once explained and you look at it and recognize it in various stories, you have to admit that the description is sound but does not clairify a damn thing.<br/><br/>One of the more interesting method was found in Stephen King On Writing. Know what he said about story structure? Not a goddamned thing. The only thing he said about that was to "read a lot and write a lot" that is, to absorb other people's stories while trying your own hand at it and in this way you get some practical experience in what works and what don't. <br/><br/>I say this is interesting because this is how we all learned to speak as children. This is how language is learned. This has led me to believe that story is like a language with "grammatical" structure on how to put things together and in what order to achieve the desired effect.                        </div>

                            That's easy, Andy.<br/>
<br/>
See, in developing my crap on roleplaying, I first came to define roleplaying itself as shared imagining. (No role, no playing) So if you have a group of people freeform narrating you might get this:<br/>
<br/>
Guy #1: "There's a grey cat sitting on a couch."<br/>
Guy #2: "It gets up and goes to it's little box."<br/>
Guy #1: "It tenatively sniffs and digs a bit before climbing in."<br/>
Guy #3: "And then it has explove diarrhea and makes a shotgun blast all over the wall behind the litter box."<br/>
<br/>
See? Roleplaying, so long as all the players are all imagining the cat and what it does. However, this is pretty boring. It reminds me of playing with blocks or early virtual reality experiments which were, well, playing with blocks. You can move the blocks around, build them up, knock them over, but this get dull eventually.<br/>
<br/>
In further examining, I thought "Well, hey, maybe telling stories using this media would be a good idea." but then I though "But what the hell is a story? And what the hell makes me think it's a good idea?" kind of funny, right. There are stories all around me, I've probably experienced thousands in my lifetime, hell, I've even written a couple but I couldn't say what one was. Well, that's just useful as fucking piss.<br/>
<br/>
So I did some research into it and found some very nifty things in there about how the structure of story is based on how the human brain works and how a well-crafted story is recalled as a whole instead of individual pieces and the structure is geared toward maintaining interest and stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
So, to answer your question. I don't think that developing a consensus on a definition is going to be very helpful at all. I mean if we need a definition, "a series of related events" works just fine. but that don't help play one whit, now does it.<br/>
<br/>
But an understanding of the structure of story, a sense of story, if you will, would impact play considerably, I think, for some of the reasons I hinted at two paragraphs ago.                        </div>

                            Joshua - My definition of a story is something that one person tells to another person about something.  A good story is that but also has a point that is made effectively even though the listener didn't know they were going to get a point... or anything by Hemingway.  On a side: Perhaps the oral tradition of storytelling is closer to the playing of RPGs.<br/><br/>Jack - I don't know what the University of Iowa's Fiction Writer Workshop is using as their main book for teaching writing now, but when I was there <i>Writing Fiction: A Guide to Narrative Craft</i> by Janet Burroway was pretty popular.  I just pulled mine out to look at it, and found an old picture of my barefoot next to the book.  On my foot was a blood sucking leach.  I took a picture and then pulled it off.  I bled a little. &lt;---- That's a story, BTW, but not a good one.<br/><br/>Andy - By understanding what a story is, we can apply the techniques used in story telling to enhance our games. Or avoid the pitfalls of a story in our games.<br/><br/>I think it might be important to distinguish what is created by playing an rpg from what is created by telling a story.  There is some intermingling of techniques between the two art forms, but a rpg doesn't have to create a story to still be a worthwhile art, although it can.  I'm not sure how to distinguish the two arts further and will leave that to someone brighter than I.                        </div>

                            Andy, I think splitting this discussion off into "what is a <em>good</em> story?" veers off into aesthetics and everybody has a different opinion, there.  That's why I didn't ask that question.<br/><br/>As for the question "what is <em>story</em>?" I think there is a lot of good that can come out of it, not the least of which is hearing what other people's definitions are and how much effort and rigor they put into their definitions.  Especially if the name of the site is Story Games, we should probably at least talk about this -- whether or not we come up with a consensus definition (which I'm less than interested in).<br/><br/>Jack, no, your guy at work is not a story.  It's an account, perhaps, but it's not a story, at least not in my book.  So too the Sims itself is not a story.  Perhaps an individual game of the Sims, where the player is invested in accomplishing something specific and projects that investment and desire on the little Sim on the screen -- perhaps that could be a story.  Maybe.<br/><br/>Graham, those aren't conflicts, those are requirements.  Conflict = character + desire + obstacle.  Typically, the Sims has none of those three.  A Sim is not a character (unless perhaps the player is particularly invested and projects character onto them), requirments are not desires, and what few obstacles there are are pretty weak (oh no, a chair is in the way!).  So without that authorial impetus from the player, no, the Sims ain't a story by my definition. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

                            I agree with Joshua that the question "what is a good story" is a different and possibly more complex question.  And we need to decide what a story is before we can judge what a good one is anyway, right?<br/>
<br/>
It is very hard for me to come up with a definition of "story" that fits all of the cases that I think are stories.  I tend to have a much more permisive idea of what a story is that Joshua, more along Jack's lines I suspect.  Maybe its useful to consider some specific cases and decide if they are stories; a "sniff test" of any definition.  Everyone's feeling will be different, but these are mine.<br/>
<br/>
Pride and Prejudice -- Story.  Hopefully no one disagrees with this, it has a clear begining, middle and end.<br/>
<br/>
Buffy seasons 1 - 7 -- Story.  And a single story at that in my mind.  Even though each season comes to a pretty firm conclusion, the seasons build on one another and characters develop over them.<br/>
<br/>
The Die Hard Trilogy -- Not a Story.  Or really, three different stories.  The difference between this and Buffy is subtle, same character goes through several sub-stories.  Maybe its the lack of character carry-over from one movie to the other that makes me think this is not a single story in my gut.<br/>
<br/>
Jack's Office Worker Case -- Story.  Its minimalist, but its a story in my gut.<br/>
<br/>
Spiderman -- Story.  An interesting story because it has not ending as TonyLB mentioned.  I belive it was Ben Lehman who said that stories naturally conclude in the previous thread, and this is a good counter example in my mind.<br/>
<br/>
The Sims -- Not a Story.  Just like a RPG this gives the tools for creating a story, bit it is not one itself.<br/>
<br/>
Gameplay with a single family of the Sims -- Story.  Once you actually play the Sims you craft a story with conflicts (bathroom or kitchen?!?!?!?!?!?!) and even endings (death or promotion to max level job).  I'm being picky here between the Sims alone and playing the Sims, but it feels important to me.<br/>
<br/>
So based on this my definition of story would be "A sequence of events over time involving one or more characters joined by proximity and/or shared characters."  <br/>
<br/>
Clunky, huh?<br/>

                            Interesting, Chris.<br/><br/>The parts that interest me is the Office Worker and Die Hard.  If Jack kept going with his office worker's plight into the next day, would that be the same story, or would it be another story like Die Hard II is another story?<br/><br/>Also, an additional thought, we're probably conflating things when we refer to stories by the titles of the works that present them.  There are, without a doubt, multiple stories in Pride and Prejudice.  There are certainly multiple stories in Buffy 1-7.  Equating the work with the story seems like we're confusing something (as Chris points out with the Sims).                        </div>

                            Along the lines of what JBR said, I'm going to be a troublemaker and introduce some different terms, shamelessly stolen from the narratological work of Mieke Bal.<br/><br/>We can talk about what makes a story at three different levels: the levels of fabula, story and text.<br/><br/>A fabula is what we might refer to as plot, or what I like to call "a sequence of events in a diegetic world."  By this I mean that there is a sequence of events that happens in an imaginary yet logically consistent universe which we are capable of imagining and reasoning about.  The reasoning-about part is important, by the way; that's what lets us determine things like whether a given sequence is possible or plausible.<br/><br/>From a fabula, we construct a story.  A story is a particular way that the events of the fabula are presented.  For example, we could present the events of the fabula in order, or with flashbacks, or in reverse order (<i>Memento</i>, anyone?).  We can change the amount of representational time that we give to different elements of the fabula, or create individualized characters from the archetypal ones of the fabula, and choose a point of view from which to present the story.  A story is a series of specific narrative choices made about the fictional events.  (And I would argue that even true events are made fictional by the choice to tell about them, much as Jack's been arguing with his 'shared imagining' approach.)<br/><br/>Finally, there is the text - the way that the story is actually presented.  Is it a movie, or a book, or is it performed as theater, or performed over the course of a role-playing game?  What language is it written in?  How well does the author convey the point of view and the characters and the other elements of the story?<br/><br/>I'd also like to pick up Chris's distinction between "story" and "tools that construct a story."  I'd agree that <i>The Sims</i> is not a story, but that players of the game can use it to construct a story.  Similarly, most RPGs can be played as games, but can also be used as story-construction tools.  It kind of depends on what you do with it.<br/><br/>Stories can also contain other stories.  I'd say that <i>Buffy</i> is a story.  So is each season of <i>Buffy</i>.  So are most of the <i>Buffy</i> episodes.  Plus there are stories which aren't confined to the format of the text, but rather are woven within and between different episodes and different seasons.<br/><br/>To address the "So what?" concern, I'll point out that Bal's work has profoundly affected my style as a GM, my work as a game designer and my academic work (though I suppose only the former two are relevant here).  I build my games by inventing a diegetic world which I then try to make accessible to players, but work on ways that we can then construct a story which actually takes a stance regarding theme, point of view, time spent on events, etc.  Finally, we also work on our ability to perform the stories that we're creating - working on our acting, our eloquence, and our improvisation skills as a way of dealing with this at the level of text.<br/><br/>That's enough of a rant for now, but I hope it's interesting or at least useful.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<i>"Jack, no, your guy at work is not a story. It's an account, perhaps, but it's not a story, at least not in my book. So too the Sims itself is not a story. Perhaps an individual game of the Sims, where the player is invested in accomplishing something specific and projects that investment and desire on the little Sim on the screen -- perhaps that could be a story. Maybe."</i><br/><br/>I actually agree. I mean, it fits the dictionary definition, but it still lacks something. The narrativism essay refers to this as a little something.<br/><br/>PFTUI!  "Little something" my ass. It's a pretty fucking important little something, like a newborn baby missing a little something like, say, its head.<br/><br/>The story of Bill is not a story because it's dead on the page (or screen, as the case seems to be) As dead as a headless baby. So that it relates a series of events is, simply put, not enough.<br/><br/>Consider this sentence:<br/><br/>"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously."<br/><br/>I guess this is a fairly famous sentence written by some guy who don't matter for this discussion. The thing about this sentece is that it is grammatically correct yet is is nonsense. It has no meaning.<br/><br/>Bill's story is likewise nonsense because it also has no meaning. Nothing happens at any point. Meaning is the beating heart of story.<br/><br/>How do we add meaning to a story?                        </div>

                            Jess made my point a lot better than I was going to - and the taxonomy of "story levels" will be useful to me for time to come, I think.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that did strike me from my own experience is that often-times the story develops out of play, but is most clearly communicated in retelling.  In other words, while an RPG is a great way to write stories, and the can be experientially very compelling, they're usually not a very good way to _tell_ stories.<br/>
<br/>
Which raises a the question of how to reframe a pre-existing fabula.  If you were going to retell ??Memento,?? how much should you divorce it from the film?  Most of the time when someone retells the plot of a movie or a game, it's deadly dull, but I wonder if it's because they're hung up on the details of the text they saw it in that you don't share.<br/>
<br/>
There's a great bit from one of the early seasons of ??Red Dwarf:??<br/>
<br/>
bq. Two guys are trapped on a spaceship, and one them (Rimmer) is a complete tool.  He's the social misfit you don't have any pity for.  Rimmer forces his sole shipmate (Lister) to listen to an endless recounting of a game of Risk he played years before but remembers with disgusting clarity, to the point of describing individual die rolls in the conquest of Australia.  Lister gets to the point where he would gleefully choke Rimmer to death, except he can't because Rimmer is already dead.<br/>
<br/>
Funny, eh?  Well, I guess you had to be there.                        </div>

<em>an RPG is a great way to write stories... they're usually not a very good way to tell stories.</em><br/><br/>Word, Judson.<br/><br/>A game <em>can't</em> start with a fabula.  If you do, the game is dead in the water before you begin, or you are at best taking a deadly-long time dressing the windows.  The fabulous thing about RPGs is that they actually create the story from the other direction -- giving you content, rules, and procedures for the text, and by using them you create a story, from which you might extract a fabula if you care to.                        </div>

                            Actually, JBR, the reality is probably somewhere between the two extremes.  Theories of reading get pretty deep into this question, and while there's no consensus, it's clear that no author can possibly put everything they mean into a narrative text - and that readers/players/whatever cannot completely ignore the meaning of the narrative while still being able to claim that they are "reading" it in any meaningful way. <br/><br/>Perhaps a more useful way to ask the question would be, "How can an author communicate meaning accurately to her audience?" and "What are the most fruitful areas in which players or readers can create meaning within a story?"<br/><br/>Plus, those are nicely practical.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess<br/><br/>PS I don't want to be Queen Academe here, but if anyone thinks that references on reading theory would be useful, I can post some when I get a chance.                        </div>

                            I'm pretty conversant with reading theory, Jess.  I used to teach both lit theory and reading (obviously, to different students).<br/><br/>What I'm trying to get at is that "meaning" is polyvalent, non-exhaustive, non-prescriptive.  It can be influenced, surely, but it cannot be dictated.  Trying to put "it" into something and expecting it to be transmitted to the audience exactly as intended is futile.  It's the same arrogance of the railroading GM who thinks that there is "the story" and that they are somehow involving the other players in it through the game.  Meaning isn't a letter and story an envelope that you can just send to people through the mail.<br/><br/>I think the most useful and practical question would be more like "How can a game designer create an experience that is ripe for players to create meaning from it?"  The designer does not create meaning, does not package it into the story, does not leave it like easter eggs for the players to find.  The designer can certainly <em>influence</em> whatever meaning the players may create out of the stories they play, but that's hardly the same thing as "adding" meaning to the story.                        </div>

<p>In a novel, it's hard to quite figure out what the techniques are that you can use to reward a reader for interpreting the work as being about fear rather than about leather.

 I take it that your point is that meaning is what separates a story from "a bunch of stuff that happened."  <br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that Josh's position seems to be that while an author might have a meaning in mind when he produced a work, an audience is going to take their own meaning away from it, and that the two meanings are unlikely to be identical - even if author and audience are identical.  So attempting to communcate a meaning through any medium is problematic at best.<br/>
<br/>
Contrariwise, while there are attempts to present stories without a meaning in mind, on the grounds that the audience will take away a meaning anywise, I at least tend to find them unsatisfying.  Dada is a reasonably good example, as is a certain segment of current popular media.<br/>
<br/>
bq. One of the more interesting method was found in Stephen King On Writing. Know what he said about story structure? Not a goddamned thing. The only thing he said about that was to "read a lot and write a lot" that is, to absorb other people's stories while trying your own hand at it and in this way you get some practical experience in what works and what don't.<br/>
<br/>
Which is great and all - and if it works for you, go in good health.  It isn't, however, useful in terms of discussing the creation and communication of a story.  (One might also point to the quality of Steven King's work as an argument against taking his adivce too seriously -- but that's unlikely to be profitable.)  <br/>
<br/>
And the key thing is: "if it works for you."  If it does, why are asking questions about meaning and story?  Because inescapably those are questions of structure and semantics.  Those are the tools that language using primates use to communicate anything, from the simplest concepts to the deepest meanings.                        </div>

                            Boy, judson, i don't know how to respond to all that, but I'll try...in no particular order.<br/><br/><i>I take it that your point is that meaning is what separates a story from "a bunch of stuff that happened."</i><br/><br/>That is, at least, one of the things, yes.<br/><br/><i>It seems to me that Josh's position seems to be that while an author might have a meaning in mind when he produced a work, an audience is going to take their own meaning away from it, and that the two meanings are unlikely to be identical - even if author and audience are identical.

In the previous paragraph you'd said that communicating meaning is problematic at best, but here you say that stories written without meaning are unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Were I more of a dick, I would probably harp on the point or something. I'm a dick, but not enough of a dick. Not tonight, anyway.<br/><br/>See, there is a reason why no meaning from the author is unsatisfying while the meaning from the author is not necessarily what the audience takes away. When the author taylors his story with a particular meaning in mind, it tightens up the telling. This makes the story more interesting/entertaining/satisfying... whatever you want to call it. It's something likely to hold you attention, at any rate. The audience will still take their own meanings away, but the craft in the telling makes that possible. <br/><br/>I mean, what meaning is there in Bill's Story (above)? I suppose if stretched someone could come up with something about the cycle of daily life or something. See, you can find meaning in almost anything. It's kind of ironic that having a single meaning in the creation of the story can lead to many different meanings taken away, but there you go.<br/><br/><i>Which is great and all - and if it works for you, go in good health.

An anology I thought might be useful. If you'll reread the begining of that post, you'll see how annoyed I was at having a hard time finding out what story was from books supposedly about how to make a story.<br/><br/>I hope that clears up a couple things.                        </div>

<blockquote><i>Andy - By understanding what a story is, we can apply the techniques used in story telling to enhance our games. Or avoid the pitfalls of a story in our games.</i></blockquote>
I'm definitely interested in that. However, I just scrolled up a couple dozen posts, and haven't seen any account yet of how this affects how dice hit the table (save Tony's post, and Joshua's example of the GM running "his story" - though I think most of us here are in the camp that that's not the way we generally like to play - ). <br/><br/>I'm still seeing a lot of movement towards arguing over the definition of story and the like in a literary context. And again, not reaching consensus is cool and all, but already we're seeing folks getting frustrated with each other's definition, <i>and we're not even talking about the gaming table yet</i>.<br/><br/>My general unease comes from the fact that I've seen this very topic argued at least five times over the years on the old RPGNet, new RPGNet, and the Forge... and each time it's usually resulted in arguments and/or flamewars.  Now, that's not happening here, but already we're seeing people getting upset with each other's arguments. If the point here is really to hear "what other people's definitions are and how much effort and rigor they put into their definitions", but then get bothered when people post their definitions and stand behind them with effort and rigor, then what are we doing here in this thread? Why torture ourselves?<br/><br/>I don't mind talking about stories, and listing your favorite personal definition of story, but we're now at the point where:<br/><br/>1) If you're gonna argue about what a story is, it's time to do it elsewhere.<br/>2) If you're gonna post your personal definition of what a story is, go ahead and do it.<br/>3) If you're going to discuss how your own definition of story, or someone else's definition of story, can aid players in playing a game, or a designer in writing a game (which is totally I'd totally love to see), it's time to get to specifics, in this thread or new ones.<br/><br/>I want to get to Story Now! with our discussion on stories. :-)                        </div>

                            Hmmm. Unfortunately (I read the LJ posts), they're not saying all that much about roleplaying. The second two don't say anything at all about RPing, though they're obviously generating examples with which you'll eventually tie them back into RPing  <br/><br/>The main point of the first LJ was that you appear to agree with Joshua in terms of "Story in Roleplaying =/= Playing through the GM's Set Story" (well, substitute "=/=" with "shouldn't be"). The second one was just talking about story in the lit sense, no ties to RP. The third one again was just talking about story in the lit sense, with the point of "stories seem to have an element of character change" &lt;-- Which is cool, as illustrated by your graph, and I can &lt;i&gt;see how it applies to RPing, but you didn't actually come out and say how to make use of it.<br/><br/>It seems that you're sitting on this huge pile of cool ideas that you gained from reading your story lit books and the like, but check out your LJ: They're only coming out in a trickle, barely at all. Rather than wait for you to get around to putting thought and effort into LJ posts, I'd rather see a stream-of-consciousness (if that's what it takes) dump of the ideas you're storing up to write about, and how they relate to gaming.  I can see them coming out in LJ Posts 4,5,6+... but I want to hit Fast Forward and get to them Now, if possible.                        </div>

<p>Story can be constructed retroactively based on a set of events which are filtered through the perception and memory of the players at the table.</p>

<p>If you're rolling the dice and interpreting them personally (some styles of D&amp;D are classic for this ...

                            Oh, dude, Tony, that brings up a GREAT fucking point about Story at the gaming table.<br/><br/>So yeah, sure, we're creating a story at the table about our half elf's family destiny and the like.<br/><br/>But on top of that, and probably more importantly, a story is developing in how the game is played, through the mechanics of the game and the interactions of the players.<br/><br/>"I still remember the time that, back in high school in AD&amp;D 2E, my GM and best bro Steve made my human Scottish highlander (strapped naked to an altar) roll a bend bars roll to succeed (it was a variant where high roll was better) in breaking the chains that were wrapped around me as my dude was about to be sacrificed.  I rolled a "97" as he was helping another player, at which Drew and I roared... but since Steve wasn't there to see me roll it, it didn't count! (fair enough) So I rolled again, and got a "00" (100), at which everyone at the table flipped out. Steve narrated the greatest, most empowering description possible."<br/><br/>"The other day we were playing a fairly traditional fantasy island-hopping pirates game, with sort of the traditional "No 'say yes or roll the dice', no 'you narrate the results you want', no 'hippie conflict resolution' " game system. Anyway, we were still getting used to it, when Remi's Water Monk and Jason's Pirate Captain got in an argument over the specifics of the island they just spotted in relation to the maps they both secretly carried.  Remi, still stuck in "conflict narration" mode, said, "Fine! If you win, this is the pirate island we're looking for and my map is wrong. If I win, this is the Island of your Eternal Tormented Fetal Offspring!" That was so groundshakingly awesome that we were stunned even as we tried to reel the game back into task resolution-ville"<br/><br/>"Beth has never won a game of Settlers of Catan against us, even though it's her favorite game.  I must have played with her 15 times over the past four years, and any time she's even near close someone else pulls out ahead.  Anyway, the other day we were playing and she finally won, fair and square, none of us pulling punches!  She was so happy that she took pictures of us and the board and a newspaper to show the date."<br/><br/>These are real stories that we bring with us OUTSIDE of the story that takes place in our little imaginitive space.  <br/><br/>I think I'll end up starting a thread when I have some time on how to set up conditions to create the above kinds of Play Stories, the stories we take from the social aspects of the games (it seems that randomness mechanics and opportunities for player input are two big winners on that front).<br/><br/>Damn Tony, you shook loose some real pragmatic stuff there.                        </div>

                            OK, here's a practical bit from me.  <br/>
<br/>
To me, "story" is about closure.  A story has a beginning and an end.  If there is a beginning, then the ending will generally bring you back to that beginning, or resolve what was set up in the beginning.  That gives the story a sense of completeness.  Sometimes the beginning is somewhat unrelated, and instead the ending resolves something from more in the middle.  But I think to be more story-like the beginning should be just as clear.  Note that this sense of completeness is not always the best thing.  Sometimes you want to give some sense of openness.  <br/>
<br/>
How does this apply to story games?  Well, story games are usually meandering because they aren't outlined in advance and they develop out of the interactions of multiple authors.  So the beginning rarely sets up the ending.  You can do it a bit in games with predetermined endings.  So in My Life With Master, you can start with the Master doing something bad, and you know that it will end with the Master dying.  On the other hand, that sort of predetermination is also pretty limiting.  <br/>
<br/>
I try to do something similar in my Buffy episodes.  There is generally an item or creature which is the central symbol of the episode.  So if I start on that (or something related), then I can get definite closure.  More often I resolve a key piece but don't have a snappy opening...  and that's OK.                        </div>

                            Not just closure, for me. Closure, plus a point. For me, the author has to get involved for it to be a story. Not just, here's an account with a beginning, middle, and end, but here's why I told it. Maybe the "why" isn't obvious, but that's fine.<br/><br/>Oh, and I think we have a name for that. It's Premise, right?                        </div>

                            Well, closure is kind of a weird thing. Story is an artwork made of life. Most of life is pretty boring, like Bill's Story above. People strike some kind of comfortable balance in there life. Where a story exists is when that balance is upset and life changes. So pretty much all stories are about how life goes from one state of being to another. The character don't get back to how they were before, necessarily, but they do strike a comfortable balance with the new life state.                        </div>

Often, the author will have one idea for what the point is, and the readers (even the majority of readers) will have a very different idea of what the point is.

                            I'd like to cite Charles Bukowski's work as story without closure. It stopped when Bukowski died, that's all. What about 'Big Two-Hearted River' by Hemingway?<br/><br/>I don't have a neat definition of 'story.' I think lots of things are stories, but some grip you or amuse you more than others. Style Does Matter.<br/><br/>Somebody or other referred to Premise as having been 'invented', and that's quite important. How do you 'get meaning' into a story? One way is that you can pose big questions and let the answers generate meaning. That's an appropriate and functional form for roleplaying, which is collaborative.<br/><br/>From multiple addresses of Premise, we see meaning emerge. To return to Bukowski, the story of Henry Chinaski can be seen as hundreds of moments of addressing the Premise: What will you do for your art? (Feel free to insert other Premises) It's a pretty good analogue for an RPG character. Only the death of the author ended the character's career.<br/><br/>I still don't know about the Hemingway story. I might have to read it again.                        </div>

You know, arguably, what you describe does happen in a good roleplaying game. The unexpected happens, people turn out to be more (or less) than they appear. And so do the characters....                        </div>

                            Not really, no. I mean you could kludge some kind of RPG that kinda sorta helps make a story, but ultimately it will be a kludge because RPGs have been based on a set of principles that are the antithesis of story making. To really make a story, it has to be built from scratch from the ground up. Which unfortunately means it will be a whole new thing, and will need to gather a whole new audience because the pre-existing RPG audience will want nothing to do with it.                        </div>

                            Since Andy brought up the question of how our theoretical notions affect our play and our design, I figured I'd take a second to expand on some of the stuff I mentioned earlier.<br/><br/>When I design a game, I try to get players to think about the events that are happening (the fabula) but also how they're going to present those events (the story).  For example, in <i>Decade</i> I wanted to give the players motivation to come up with some events that they want to happen in a scene, by giving them particular emotions to portray and leaving it up to them what events will cause those emotions to play out.  I decided to control some things about the story (i.e. that it all takes place in one hour) but leave the contents of the fabula up to the players. <br/><br/>Oddly enough, this comes out in a very different way when I GM.  I develop the notion of the fabula very strongly, particularly when it comes to a sense of things happening off-stage.  While I rarely fiat what those off-stage things will be, it's key to my style of game that the players always feel that they're in a world that is larger than their individual acts.  When I GM, the fabula is bigger than the story.  I visualize it as a camera following the PCs through the world, zooming in on them but occasionally turning to frame something else, so that there's a sense of what the world of narrative possibility is like.<br/><br/>As a player, these ideas have mostly made me very open to making story suggestions and game elements, even before I discovered the indie scene.  I had the notion that a player might try to participate on all three levels of the story, not just the level of text ("let's act out the GM's story") or the level of story ("let's deal with these events that have happened") but also at the level of fabula ("let's invent some stuff that's in the world, even if it never comes up").  While it's hardly original, these notions have made me a strongly collaborative player (and GM, for that matter).<br/><br/>I don't know whether these ideas will be useful to anyone else, but they've shaped my own style - admittedly in an incoherent way - and are continuing to shape it as I continue to learn and think and theorize.<br/><br/>I'm also working on some of the things that Jack alluded to (cognitive aspects of storytelling), but it's a huge topic and I don't really have any conclusions that would be useful to share.  You'll probably notice me bring up ideas about this in specific contexts, where it might be useful to us as designers, GMs and players - but I'm not yet ready to generalize.  I'll save that for my dissertation.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Hence the 'prosthetics' analogy. And teaching people that they have legs to use.

                            I'm having a very hard time keeping track of this form!  I apologize to all the interesting replies between my last post and here, but I wanted to address things that were said in responce to me specifically.<br/>
<br/>
Joshua BishopRoby wrote: "The parts that interest me is the Office Worker and Die Hard. If Jack kept going with his office worker's plight into the next day, would that be the same story, or would it be another story like Die Hard II is another story?"<br/>
<br/>
For me the Office Worker's continued plight would be one story, as it is joined by time and by the same characters.  If we picked up with the office worker 10 years later when he's working for the CIA, that's a different story.<br/>
<br/>
You very correctly identify that the line between the Office Worker story and Die Hard I, II, etc, is a fuzzy one for me.  Kleenestar's post helped me identify why I feel there is a difference.<br/>
<br/>
kleenestar wrote: "Stories can also contain other stories. I'd say that Buffy is a story. So is each season of Buffy. So are most of the Buffy episodes. Plus there are stories which aren't confined to the format of the text, but rather are woven within and between different episodes and different seasons."<br/>
<br/>
In my own usage I prefer to call the largest thing that Jess calls a "story" above an actual Story, while the smaller story-like units are Story-lines.  I think its a useful distinction to make because different story-lines interact.  The end of Buffy season 3 leads into the begining of Buffy season 4.  The story of Faith's decent into evil causes side effects in Xander and Cordelia's love story.  <br/>
<br/>
For me a Story is unique because it involves a set of storylines that are not part of any other story.<br/>
<br/>
The fabula / story / text distinction is a very useful one Jess, thanks for bringing that to my attention.<br/>

                            I can dig it, Chris, but (they're always a but) I'd like to introduce you to the "talking books" line of literary theory.  The line of thinking goes like this: all stories are created from cultural contexts made up of other stories, and so all stories are reactions, additions, and reinterpretations of other stories.  Stories already all interact.<br/><br/><em>Lord of the Flies</em> is a reaction to <em>Coral Island</em>; <em>1984</em> is a reinterpretation of <em>We</em>.  Or if you think the fictional content must be the same to some extent, consider <em>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead</em> and its relationship to <em>Hamlet</em>.<br/><br/>I'm not so much trying to discount your distinction, but I think the line between the two is even fuzzier than you think.                        </div>

                            And, to bring this back to practicality, perhaps we can talk about how we reuse/reconfigure stories in our roleplaying.  I'm big on intertextuality: I know that I've very deliberately created countertexts, updated myths, and the like.  More in a moment in a new thread, I suppose.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            That's an exceedingly good point Joshua.  I will try to firm the line by noting the distinction between stories that interact with each other within the world of the story (Xander's story interacts with Cordelias) vs. stories that interact with each other outside the world of the story (1984 vs. We).  R&amp;G are Dead is a horrible mutant that breaks the rules!<br/>

                            Actually, if I understand your meaning correctly, <i>R&amp;G Are Dead</i> doesn't break the rules - it's just part of a genre that has its own rules, namely that of the countertext.  A countertext is a new text that retells a story from another perspective.  <i>Paradise Lost</i> is a countertext, for example, telling the whole Fall thing from Satan's side (more or less).  So is <i>Wide Sargasso Sea</i>, which tells the story of Rochester's first wife, giving you a whole new perspective on that supposed hero.  So is <i>Grendel</i>.  I'm sure I could come up with a bunch more!<br/><br/>This just to say: there will be no calling Stoppard's work a mutant.  I'm way too much in love with it for that.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Now I want to design a specifically countertextual RPG that uses the original fiction as conflict resolution material . . . .<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>
