To enter, you need two things: a group that has committed to playing 2 sessions of a randomly assigned game, and a game that one of the group's members has created* (likely you).<br/><br/>This gives us a list of play groups, and an equally long list of games.<br/>most groups will have no cross-exposure with the game they are given.<br/><br/>*urge people to take games tehy've previously created for game design contests, 24-hour challenges, systems they've toyed with for the last three years, ashcans that aren't getting enough attention... anything that they've created that isn't getting enough oxygen.<br/><br/>2.) Assign each group a game, at random.<br/><br/>3.) Each group needs to play two sessions of the game they received, regardless of their play preferences.<br/>3a.) The first session must be played "straight"; the second session <i>can </i>be drifted, incorporate playtesting edits the group wants to try out, or use a hacked setting.<br/><br/>4.) Each group/entrant submits a 100-word Actual Play Summary for each session, a 100-word critique of the game, and 1-2 pieces of feedback about the game in question. If they want to do more, they can do it off-screen.<br/><br/>5.) If there are prizes, they are awarded by "hey, you did something really cool with that game" or "hey, I wish I got that kind of design feedback from my entrant!" kind of peer review.<br/>5a.) Possibly a "Best Setting Hack/Drift" award, a "Best Pitch" award, and for the games themselves, a "Most Deserving of More Oxygen" award.<br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/>How would you do this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211700/#Comment_211700" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T13:58:28+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  1:58PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This seems to focus on getting something playtested for a designer.

I like Joe's, but yeah it's a little bit of a playtest angle there, and focuses on the contest-games rather than completed games. Still, for what it is, it's not bad.<br/><br/>We actually had a play contest earlier at S-G: It was a "play this game with that system":<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5156" rel="nofollow">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=5156</a><br/><br/>Judd had a contest of sorts, "interview a gamer as if they were a rockstar". I participated, and it was really fun:<br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8791" rel="nofollow">http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8791</a><br/><br/>I'd have to think about what I'd like to see in a play contest. I think it would look like this:<br/>1) Choose a game that was released between Jan 1st 1990 and Dec 31st 2000 (fertile ground: TORG, Vampire and other WoD games, Star Wars 2ed, Amber, Feng Shui, Legend of the Five Rings, Castle Falkenstein, Fading Suns, tons more were from that time period).<br/>2) Play a campaign of at least 3 sessions.<br/>3) You can drift the rules as much as you want, or houserule as much as you see fit, but you still have to stick to something from the core rules (that is, you can't just lift a setting and run it with a modern system; but you could totally rewrite how character generation, combat or whatever worked).<br/>4) Then later, talk about how you played it. What sorts of "modern" things, sensibilities or rules hacks did you implement?<br/>5) The play descriptions I like the most for whatever reason gets a hardcopy of the new re-release of Earthdawn. Or like a case of Snapple or something.<br/><br/>Actually, that sounds like a cool idea. Not going to pull the trigger on it yet (no time now), but that's a contest that I'd like to see.<br/><br/>What would be a contest that <b>you</b> would like to see? Joe and I have posted, what do you want to see in a play contest?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211717/#Comment_211717" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T14:26:30+00:00" title="June 11, 2009  2:26PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to have a one on one play contest where you can play any game you want, but it has to be a one on one game, for like a month and then just write about it.
