This concept takes me back to an old problem I never solved: how do you simulate the learning curve found in stories like <i>Initial D</i>?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who aren't familiar with it, <i><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_D" rel="nofollow">Initial D</a></i> features a young driver who is a very talented streetracer with a lot to learn. Each race presents him with a new puzzle, and he cannot win (or progress) until he solves the puzzle. What makes this different from regular rpgs is that there is nothing (or almost nothing) random about his challenges. Neither are they resource-based or a skill number. They are mysteries to be solved.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe combination of cars (plus tracks sometimes) being raced present the components of the puzzle. Things can get very detailed in terms of their characteristics, but other features are simply overlooked or compensated for by driver skill. For example, the top speed of one car may be much greater, but it doesn't matter if the driver isn't fearless enough to go that fast before the next turn. While these drastic differences may be overlooked, seemingly minor differences can determine the winner. This puts a very different spin on how rpgs normally handle vehicle performance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe car designs of the 30s had enough space in the front for some pretty serious engines if I'm willing to downplay the dominance of internal combustion and allow steam and electric. That should give lots of variation between cars. I seem to be looking at big lists of characteristics, for the drivers' skills, for the cars, and for the tracks themselves, so I need to start gathering that info.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnto the question: can anyone point to, or suggest a book containing, information on steam engine performance and weight (piston or turbine)? Early electric car engines? Early internal combustion?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146866/#Comment_146866" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-30T09:19:55+00:00" title="May 30, 2008  9:19AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: madunkieg</cite>The car designs of the 30s had enough space in the front for some pretty serious engines if I'm willing to downplay the dominance of internal combustion and allow steam and electric.

That's a clue to solving the puzzle to win the race, but it's probably not enough on its own.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure how well this aspect of the story came through in the live-action version of Initial D. I know the anime versions spent a tremendous amount of time on it, analyzing very particular details of each car (e.g. the differences in acceleration patterns between twin-turbo, single turbo, high-rev and supercharged cars) to find a weakness that could be exploited. It's a pretty common formula in sports stories (e.g. Hajime No Ippo, Eyeshield 21, Aoki Densetsu Shoot, etc.).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to build these puzzles, I need the details that will become the clues, and that means gathering performance characteristics (I could just make things up, but I like to mix a little truth in with my lies). <i>Anything</i> that could become a clue for a race puzzle could be useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I think of it, this story pattern isn't too different from a game I was raving about in Game Chef, called "Be Real," where players were given clues one at a time. Players form a hypothesis of how to win, try it, and if it fails, they get another clue with which to alter their hypothesis. In this case, I think there will be just one player, plus the gamemaster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
