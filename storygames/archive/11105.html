Like most resolutions, this one is intended to change things in my life that I don't like and can be improved. In my case, what my plan aims to improve:\n<ul>\n<li>I am a middling gamemaster.</li><li>I buy more games than I play. I would like to play more of these games.</li><li>I have an aversion to gaming with strangers.</li><li>I have never GM'd a game that I haven't first played.</li><li>On nights when my wife is on call, I tend to squander my time.</li></ul>\nTo get past some of these humps, I want to run an experiment this year. For the moment, I'm calling it the Arena of Virgin One Night Stands. (This is just a working title.) The idea is this: At least six times in 2010, when my wife is on call, I want to run a different one-shot game I've never GM'd or played before with a group of strangers that have never played it before, at a table at my local gaming store.<br/><br/>I realize that this is almost certainly a sub-optimal way to approach my goals, but I'd like to try it anyway. (I'll be trying some other things, like attending more cons, as well.)<br/><br/>What I could use some help with is selecting the games. Assume I have about four of five hours to run each of these six games. And, for the sake of the argument, assume I haven't played whatever game you are thinking about. What games would lend themselves to such an experience? For whatever game you recommend, how would you run it in that context?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246567/#Comment_246567" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-14T09:43:40+00:00" title="December 14, 2009  9:43AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Lester,<br/><br/>I'm not sure I agree that your plan is sub-optimal.

You'll have repeat customers!<br/><br/>All things being equal I'd look for games that work well as single session events. Danger Patrol, Contenders*, Inspectres, 3:16.

The structure gives you something to hold on to, both GMs and player alike.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.archaiasp.com/mouse_guard_rpg.php" rel="nofollow">Mouse Guard</a> might fit that bill. It has a formal structure - punchy GMs Turn followed by punchy Players Turn - and the system is simple enough. It also has an easily identifiable hook - you're a wee mouse with a sword, blazing trails and fighting off huge snakes - that players and you can get behind easily. The preparation is minimal: there are 3 Missions in the book that you can use, and you can download pre-genned sheets for 12 mice characters. The text is also full of Luke Crane's straightforward advice on how to GM the game. Sorted.<br/><br/>Tips<br/><br/>* Consider dropping the extended Conflict system for the first game.<br/>* Skip character creation (recruitment). Use the pregens. I've run MG for a year and not created a character yet.<br/>* Go outside or to your local store and gather or buy some nuts to use as flavourful Check tokens, because folks seem to really like that.<br/>* Download, print, and cut up <a href="http://plainvanilla.typepad.com/soap/mouse-guard-cards.html" rel="nofollow">the cards for the Conflict system from here</a>. I have found them useful aids in explaining the system. Folks like having something to hold.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Pete                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246668/#Comment_246668" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-14T17:03:32+00:00" title="December 14, 2009  5:03PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Spirit of the Century: It can be a little crunchy, but character creation at the table brings the group of strangers together really nicely, and takes half the time.

Based on player input, so another way to get people instantly social and telling good stories.<br/><br/>Cyberpunk: You really can't go wrong. Everyone knows and loves the setting (right? right?!?), the system is percentile, and you get mohawks and large exploding weapons for hours of entertaining chaos and corporate revenge stories.
