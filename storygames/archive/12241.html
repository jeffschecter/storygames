A bug in a database told me I had more copies than I thought so I went to PAX East with what turned out to be all my remaining stock, and then I was trying to change to a different press, and it didn't work out, so I went back, and all of that took a couple of months.</p>\n<p>The upshot is that <a href="http://theunstore.com/index.php/unstore/game/66" rel="nofollow">Shock: is now back in stock</a> and I'm taking orders again as of yesterday afternoon. My print run of 100 is already down to 72 and I expect it to go down by another half dozen or so today, so if you have an upcoming game or something, get your copy soon. Cuz who <em>knows</em> how long it will take me to do the next print run.</p>\n<p>And while I'm talking about it, and since you've read this far and therefore probably care, the <strong><a href="http://shockhumancontact.wikispaces.com/" rel="nofollow">Shock:Human Contact wiki</a></strong> wiki is up. Soren and I have put some thought into organization and there are some fairly detailed Minuti\xe6 about the Academy, people, technologies, and sciences of the Human Contact universe. If you're playing Human Contact and have stuff you want to add, I'd love to talk about it with you!</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I fixed a typo or two, added in the Outline of Play on page 92, and as of this print run, it's got the most awesomest, fleshy-weird matte laminate you will ever feel in your life.</p>\n<p>Human Contact is teaching me some deep stuff about Shock: right now, and there are changes that will make it into the next edition, but don't hold your breath unless you can hold your breath for two years. Until then, I don't anticipate any real changes to the text, except for this piece of advice that I can't believe I never thought to write down before: as an Antagonist, write down the Protagonist's Links as your Minuti\xe6. I mean, duh, obviously, but somehow I never said to do that.</p>\n<p>So maybe someday I'll write that down in the book. In the meantime, there are 60-some copies remaining in this print run. If I sell out super-fast, I'll celebrate by writing it in to make 1.3.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I'm down to 42 my print run of 100. I'm agog. A couple of other retailers have contacted me but haven't sent me any money yet, so that number might be more like 30, if they send me a check. That's 70 copies in 3 days. I'm seriously amazed. Thank you.</p>\n<p>A lot of these have been retailer sales, so thanks for talking to your retailers about the game, and thanks for being retailers who are paying attention to small publishers!</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
