During the discussion someone (I think it was Mike Sugarbaker) suggested that non-profit status might have some additional possibilities beyond hosint a convention.<br/><br/>So let's say you had a non-profit charter and your mandate was to support, educate, and share knowledge around gaming. What activities might you do? How might you go about raising funds? If you had funds, where might you disseminate them?<br/><br/>And on a related topic, has anyone considered setting up a game company as a non-proft?

Can you think of any reason you'd do this?</blockquote>\nJohn Tynes has said that Pagan Publishing should have been a non-profit:\n<blockquote><cite><a href="http://www.rpg.net/columns/briefhistory/briefhistory6.phtml" rel="nofollow">An RPG.net history of Pagan Publishing</a></cite>Third, and perhaps most importantly, Pagan Publishing had the huge advantage of never actually being a professional publishing house, despite their attempt in 1994. This isn't reflective of the quality of their publications, which were generally top-notch. Instead it reflects the fact that Pagan Publishing didn't have to worry about paying the bills. They didn't have staff, nor warehouses, nor offices. If they wanted they could take a whole year working on a single book, and they often did; if a full-time publishing house had tried the same, they'd quickly be out of business. <b>Years later Tynes would say that he wished he'd set Pagan Publishing up as a non-profit,</b> and that really encapsulates the feelings that the Pagan authors had about making top-quality books--not a living. Any largely volunteer organization, given the appropriate skills and talents (which Pagan had in spades), can easily produce better products than any second- or third-tier RPG company, as a simple matter of economics, and that's the superior position that Pagan Publishing was working from.</blockquote>\n<br/>And I think that gives some good ideas why.  It's definitely worth considering doing, if you are making games for the love of it and not the profit potential, which is pretty small.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70673/#Comment_70673" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-20T19:31:15+00:00" title="May 20, 2007  7:31PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My SO is a nonprofit management guru (degree and all), so I'll see if I can get her to drop some science.

It's not a horrifically bad process, but it does take a little while, and a good chunk of money.<br/><br/>(Side note: We REALLY need an accountant who can help us set this up, if anyone knows someone willing. The "project your income for the next several years" part... hoo boy.)<br/><br/>As for activities I might do if I had a gaming-promotion non-profit group...<br/>* Pay people to write games for inner-city kids, or have a "game drive" for said purpose.<br/>* Create a set of Anti-Chick-Tracts. Not as much against Chick, which I admit is a worthy purpose, but explaining that certain things aren't evil, which is perhaps a loftier goal.<br/>* Many gamers are college kids. Hold a "used book drive" where they donate their old textbooks. You then either sell them to schools to get money for your group, or give them to worthy causes. The hook: hold the drive at gaming stores near colleges, and get them to give discounts based on number of books provided.<br/>* Create a series of "games as job manuals" that companies (esp. other non-profits) might be interested in buying for new employees. This both promotes gaming and gets you money.<br/>* Print various publications related to gaming, such as the "principles of successful RPG design," or collections of essays. Make them available through Lulu and Amazon, and offer them cheaper to upcoming game designers or LARP coordinators.<br/>* Create a "gamer networking" site similar to Facebook or LinkedIn, but with specific tools that gamers might want. Emphasis on either making contacts who will help you create your games, or finding people to game with.<br/>* Contact gaming companies. Ask them to give money for a charity (not you). Publicize this intensely (using volunteer effort) in non-gaming circles, to get gaming into the public eye in a positive way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70761/#Comment_70761" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T08:47:00+00:00" title="May 21, 2007  8:47AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Colin_Fredericks</cite>* Pay people to write games for inner-city kids, or have a "game drive" for said purpose.</blockquote>\nHow about "pay people to work with inner-city kids who are developing games" instead?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70770/#Comment_70770" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-21T09:17:54+00:00" title="May 21, 2007  9:17AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kynn</cite>How about "pay people to work with inner-city kids who are developing games" instead?</blockquote>\nThat sounds good too.
