Here is my idea, please help me dissect it and improve on it.<br/><br/>What I have:<br/>-Basic Rules for Magic<br/><br/>What I need:<br/>-More Secrets that expand the rules a little further<br/><br/>What I might need:<br/>-Rules for Summoning<br/><br/>Magic for TSOY<br/><br/>Magic is fantasy gaming is a seemingly ubiquitous piece, but not always a wondrous thing. No mechanic that I can create for TSOY will be either a)elegant enough to make this seem true in play or b)simple enough to be fun. Here's my idea for a widely varying magic system that is suited to each player's character concept automatically without too much of a hassle. Each group should decide how magic works and what it looks like - or if that's just completely unknown. This is based on however, not totally derived from, actual play. Thank you Eric and Lisa for your help with this.<br/><br/>Secret of Mana*<br/>You now have limited access to a form of magic. If the group has already decided on some magical schools/archetypes, use the name that appiles to your choice. Otherwise, create a name that helps describe what it is your magic does for you.<br/><br/>Mechanics:<br/>First, you now have a fourth Pool - Mana. It starts at 3. It can be increased as per the normal advancement rules for Pools in TSOY. Choose three Abilities from the list of Abilities available in your game. These are your Magical Abilities. Magical Abilities can be described in play as doing wondrous things as you desire. Also, you can spend as many Mana Pool dice as you want on any roll to add to your dice total.<br/><br/>Special: You can take this Secret again. When you do, it does not increase the size of your Mana Pool. You can take it again to either add new Abilities to your Magic Abilities list or to improve your existing Magic abilities.<br/><br/>When you make your list of three Abilities when taking this again, if you repeat an Ability, it gains +1 to your Success when it is infused with magic (i.e., when you use at least one Mana Pool die). This secret may be taken no more than 4 times (for a possible total of +3 dice on Abilities). Bonus dice, as normal, never contribute towards Transcendence.<br/><br/>Mana Pool Refreshes:<br/>Your Mana Pool refreshes depending on your Magical Abilities. Frame a scene with a PC or NPC wherein you demonstrate, discuss, become suffused in, or control Magic with one of your Magical Abilities.<br/><br/>*-No, not the game title of the same name.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79649">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79649/#Comment_79649" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-05T12:29:11+00:00" title="July  5, 2007 12:29PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so let's give it a try?<br/><br/>Secret of Dueling Magic<br/>Gain Mana Pool of 3.

I'll read that over.<br/><br/>Here, however, is what was used in actual play. Maybe this is better, not only due to it having been successfully used.<br/><br/>New Ability: Spirit Binding<br/>You can bind a Spirit to this world for a specific cause. Frame a scene where you call forth the spirit and offer them a new home for a short time. In exchange for a 'lavish' host (e.g. jewel-encrusted airship, beautifully hand-woven cloak), the spirit will provide the Binder with power. The Spirit is to be called for their ability to assist in a particular endeavor, and, when it is done, they leave their vessel. After negotiations, roll your Spirit Binding Ability. Your total now becomes a pool of Bonus Dice for you to use at your discretion on the task you set them to. When it is used up, they move on to other, more interesting things.<br/><br/>Spirits are callous and fickle things. Fail at your Ability roll and they just take something from you of value and move on. They have to be bound again if you think the task isn't completed. Calling on the same Spirit multiple times may either endear you or engender hatred. The Storyteller is encouraged to give Bonus or Penalty dice as appropriate. Don't skimp on the details!<br/><br/>I'm not sure why I just didn't go with what had worked before. It creates characters and worked really well in actual play. Here's some of what I did:<br/><br/>-Bound a Spirit Flying Whale to an airship so I could fly it with tough maneuvers despite only being partially trained.<br/>-Bound a Spirit of Charisma and Sneakiness at a Tavern (by giving it everyone's drink there) so that I could sneak into the Slave compound and convince them to revolt.<br/>-Summoned up the spirits of a long ago destroyed city and walked in their lives for an evening with a guide - payment? I took their stories, one and all.<br/>-Summoned a Chameleon spirit into a cloak. I 'transformed' into a demon before everyone's eyes.<br/>-Summoned a Storm spirit and held a cloud of storms over a flying city for a month.<br/><br/>And so on. I'm not sure what would have happened if I had transcended with the Spirit Binding, but I don't imagine it would have been tough to figure it out.<br/><br/>So, combined with the new Ability, all I would need are a couple of Secrets to trick it out,  I think. One to make a Spirit 'enhance' an Ability to make it magical comes to mind (as above :P ) You'd have to make that Spirit a permanent character, though, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Any other ideas?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79745/#Comment_79745" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-06T03:47:33+00:00" title="July  6, 2007  3:47AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite>-Summoned a Storm spirit and held a cloud of storms over a flying city for a month.</blockquote>\nBTW, I think this was a pool of Penalty Dice I could hand the GM or the players whenever a character of theirs tried to fly through the storm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
