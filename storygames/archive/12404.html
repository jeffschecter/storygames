So I want to talk about them here.<br/><br/>When you buy a game, how much playtesting do you expect? Does the amount of playtesting you expect correlate in any way with how much you spend? <br/><br/>When you make a game, how much playtesting do you seek out? How much playtesting do you actually get? What kinds of playtesting do you do? <br/><br/>We talk a lot about games that get released "without enough playtesting." How much is enough? Does that amount change if you're paying for it?<br/><br/>Interesting historical examples:<br/><br/>Tony's release of Misery Bubblegum into print, knowing he hadn't gotten the feedback he needed from playtesting. Did people complain? Yes. Was the game a smash hit? Yes. Is the now-existing fanbase giving Tony what he needs to revise the rules as written? Yes.<br/><br/>Ryan's scrapping of Know Thyself post-ashcan* and all of his ensuing guilt: did anyone feel cheated that he sold a product that had been playtested into obsolescence? Everyone who bought it seemed fine with it. Did Ryan tear himself up over selling a product and not delivering on the promise he saw inherent in the sale? Totally. Did everyone say "Hey it's cool, we're not mad, I'm glad I bought it?" Yes. Would they have been so forgiving if it hadn't been an ashcan? I'd normally guess not, but then, look at Misery Bubblegum.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*This is very similar to my experience releasing the playtest document for Homecoming, so I feel his self-flagellation.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278326/#Comment_278326" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T12:13:34+00:00" title="June 28, 2010 12:13PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>When you buy a game, how much playtesting do you expect?</blockquote>\nI personally care more about clarity &amp; focus (as opposed to a cluttered design) than a game being mechanically sound.<br/>Things I can't stand: unnecessary fiddliness, clutter, confusion about why something exists, opaque text.<br/><br/>So, some designers seem to naturally evoke clarity and focus. I require very little playtesting from them. I just like to access their thoughts and hearts, and put them into play.<br/><br/>Other designers produce really slick dice mechanics, and I know that there's a cool idea there somewhere, but I can't extract it.<br/>Achieving clarity and focus in their works takes lots of development and time. And I demand it from them. That they will produce a smooth and sound game in the process is cool, too.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>Does the amount of playtesting you expect correlate in any way with how much you spend?</blockquote>\nI expect that a game has had more playtesting for each of these values: cost, text size, complexity.<br/><br/>If I am holding a 30 page game that costs $10, I expect a fair amount of playtesting has fed into it.<br/>If I am holding a 30 page game that costs $30, I expect a great deal more has fed into it.<br/><br/>If I am holding a 300 page game that costs $10, I expect a great deal of playtesting has fed into it.<br/>If I am holding a 300 page game that costs $50, I'm expecting a shit-ton of playtesting.<br/><br/>Again: clarity and focus are more important qualities to me than mechanical soundness, and the role that playtesting plays in achieving those things is highly variable, but those are my base assumptions when looking at a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278329/#Comment_278329" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T12:25:28+00:00" title="June 28, 2010 12:25PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's really interesting to me that you think more in terms of a playtesting-per-page model than a playtesting-per-dollar model. But then, if I'm being honest with myself, I do too. The cost of a game is an arbitrary amount, and unless you're really not thinking or editing, the page count is a much more conscientious and intentional number. A larger pagecount, to me, implies more moving parts, which would mean more extensive playtesting.<br/><br/>It's funny to me that it seems like the less a game needs playtesters, the larger number of playtesters that game is likely to get: if something's less than 20 pages, comes from a designer with a strong local design culture and plenty of locals to play it with, it's on everyone's table the next week. Or in the case of Apocalypse World: the more people heard about awesome playtests of it, the more people wanted to be part of an awesome playtest of it, and the less inherently unique and useful the playtest data was. That's just human nature though, nothing to be done about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278331/#Comment_278331" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T12:37:16+00:00" title="June 28, 2010 12:37PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>A larger pagecount, to me, implies more moving parts, which would mean more extensive playtesting.</blockquote>\nYeah, exactly.<br/><br/>Looking at a physical product, at a glance, <i>page count + text density + number of charts and stat blocks</i> = my baseline assumption of how crunchy/fiddly/complex the game is.<br/>I also make assumptions about the design's clutter based on the <i>text density + number of charts and stat blocks</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278335/#Comment_278335" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T12:48:53+00:00" title="June 28, 2010 12:48PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can you unpack what you mean when you say a design's clutter?<br/><br/>When I was last working on the "thanks and credits" page for Blowback, all of this playtesting stuff had me panicked.

I expect as much playtesting as it takes to produce a quality product. More complex products require more extensive testing to verify their quality, so I expect more playtesting with more complex games, although quantity isn't the best proxy for quality when it comes to testing. I trust an iterative development process more than the "flash of insight, confirmed by a few tests" model, so information about the amount of testing that's been done on a game might make me more favorably toward it, but most designers are pretty tight-lipped about their testing process so it rarely has a direct influence on my purchasing decisions.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>When you make a game, how much playtesting do you seek out? How much playtesting do you actually get? What kinds of playtesting do you do?</blockquote>\nI've been trying to get Skype groups together to playtest my game with varying degrees of success (right now I'm not confident enough in my rules document for proper tests to happen without my involvement, so I haven't been pushing for that). I've been recording the audio of my playtests and releasing them as the <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/podcast/" rel="nofollow">AP podcast "Designer vs. Reality"</a> with the hope of encouraging either 1) AP podcast listeners to volunteer to playtest with me or 2) other designers working out mutual playtesting arrangements with me in order to get playtesting and visibility for their own designs. I haven't met with a ton of success so far (I've only featured one other designer's game on my show), but I'm still holding out hope. I'm a little surprised that other designers haven't taken me up on my mutual playtesting offer, since I figured that lots of other people would be in the same shoes as I am in needing playtest help. I've mostly been focusing my activity over on Praxis, so that might limit my visibility a bit. My professional background is in validating the design correctness of microprocessors, so I'm pretty serious about the need for good testing for complex systems.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>It's funny to me that it seems like the less a game needs playtesters, the larger number of playtesters that game is likely to get</blockquote>\nThis.

Which goes beyond playtesting the rules. I want the text, handouts and anything between me and how you play the game to be as painless as possible. <br/><br/>I'd rather have 1-2 questionable minor rules than text that is hard to use! Which goes beyond reading... I need the text to do as much work for me as possible. Easy to learn, shows me how to teach the game, easy to reference, comes with pregenerated content (characters, adventures) if they take a long time to make.<br/><br/>I just want to sit down and play. <br/><br/>Same goes for boardgames. I play the games that are quicker to setup and are shorter to play than the games that aren't. <br/><br/>I also like advanced games with plenty of crunch. But not all at once! If the game has lots of moving parts, don't require that I have to know them all before I can start playing. Most people I know... 15 minutes into learning the rules... just want to start playing... "can we just start... and learn as we go?" It's like buying a transformers toy... screw the instructions... I want to learn how to transform it by trying to transform it... which means the "actually transforming it part" needs lots of playtesting. For RPGs, characters sheets and handouts are the parts we can play with before we know how to play. <br/><br/>I know this may sound overly simplistic but one of the reasons I like indie games and can get so many people to play them... the books are small! To be fair, not all indie game text is easy to understand. But that's true for many traditional games. At least with a smaller book... there is less for me to have to translate! <br/><br/>Just because I buy a game... doesn't mean I will play it. The game has to be easy to play. Otherwise I'll resell it. And just because I play it once, doesn't mean my players will buy it and then teach others how to play. It needs to be easy to spread and share. I think a lot of this has to do with playtesting the interface between person and ideas. <br/><br/>And just like most things, quality over quantity matters in playtesting. I don't think we should get into a playtesting arms race of who can put in the most playtesting hours in or list the most playtesting credits in their books. I suspect having your mom or dad playtest the game text may be more useful than getting 8 of your friends with 10 years of gaming experience to playtest! <br/><br/>That all said, I have no idea how typical my needs, opinions or tastes are. For example, I really don't understand the page count = worth more money deal. I know a lot of best selling authors in publishing and most of their books are not priced according to page count but rather utility and desire of who ever their audience is. If the book is for a smaller audience that is hungry for it and the market isn't over saturated, people seem to be ok paying more because they know it isn't a mass market product. <br/><br/>I also completely don't understand when many people complain about how much RPGs costs. Many of those conversations seems crazy to me. And I spent many years of my childhood homeless with barely any money surviving due to the kindness of others. My family is quite poor and I know how important money is. But I don't get it. I suspect people complain partially because they buy games they don't play or buy games to check out hot new game design trend... so games seem expensive because they aren't purchased to be played. That said, I do think comic books are getting too expensive so who knows! Ha!<br/><br/>That all said, what's logical doesn't necessarily equal sales. Plenty of products with quality issues sell like crazy for reasons not related to quality. I think playtesting is essential. But won't make people buy a game they never wanted. <br/><br/>Misery Bubblegum is a hot concept! Tony also has lots of presence and is an avid salesman. And he talked up the game forever and marketed the hell out of it! That said, I know a lot of people who played Misery Bubblegum, loved it, bought it, and then couldn't get it to work by themselves and sell it to their friends. I think the game is quite frankly... brilliant! The rules work. But the interface to those rules is hard to pierce. Even though Misery Bubblegum has done well.. I suspect it could be doing many, many times better.<br/><br/>If I playtested this post it would probably be 1/10th the size and more useful!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278348/#Comment_278348" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T13:24:26+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  1:24PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does anyone have an idea about how much commercial game get playtested? Like, say L5R or a White Wolf game? Somehow I feel like these game get far less playtesting and effective playtesting due to the scope of there rules, advancement time frames and budgeting. I mean, to play all the character and rule options out would take a lot of time. Moreover, these game when I've actually  played them all sort of problematic rules that seemed like they looked good in theory but fail in practice come up. That's not even to mention the supplement tread mill. <br/><br/>Whereas, AW is like $28 for the book AND pdf. And man, the crowd-sourced playtesting meant that it was playtested to death (thousands of hours by hundreds of people). And now with the preorder editing, when it does go to the printers it's going to be pretty slick. <br/><br/>Now, $18 is what I paid for the .pdf of AW. That's like dinner and a drink and tip <i>maybe</i>, if I don't go anywhere fancy. Or less than two tickets to the movies. <br/><br/>The Gun Thief .pdf literally cost me the price of a cup of coffee. I like coffee a lot. Even still, for $3 dollar if Joe had tricked me and there wasn't even a game in there, I still be happy with it (this means zero playtesting or game design.) I bought Deluge for what, $8? Again, zero-playtesting for three cups of coffee. I wasn't really happy with the product for ten dollars, but that's nothing to do with the quality of the thing. <br/><br/>I was typing and then it occurred to me that I expect games to be really good and well playtested if your charging money for them. The cost should really be about your production values and your business model. <br/><br/>If you don't want to widely play test your game and work out all the kinks then release it for free. If your charging for it then the game and mechanics should be solid. Maybe not rock solid, but it shouldn't have any glaring errors, stupid moves, useless options, monkey wrenches. The rules should be easy enough to understand without the designer present. If you can't clearly explain a concept or mechanic in a paragraph or two of text then that's probably a red flag. <br/><br/>Enough for me means that it has been played through, start to finish, by at least three to ten different groups with and without the designer present, for every iteration of the rules. Feedback was obtained from these groups. Cons and game days are obvious choices for live beta and stress testing the design. Fundamentally, the rules should work as written. That's good design. Good design means feedback from a large group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278349/#Comment_278349" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T13:25:17+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  1:25PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's probably a mistake to believe "playtesting" = "quality". The real problem, to my mind, is games that don't work. It might be that playtesting would have caught the problems you're seeing. Or it might be that your "heavily playtested" darling was played by people who know you, know your intent, or otherwise were more closely aligned with the goals of the game than perhaps your broader audience.<br/><br/>Any design work I ever did for a client was always "heavily playtested," but we had, you know, our go-to folks for that. Which means those folks are used to whatever we're writing or designing, and are typically pretty forgiving. So we'd end up with problems, imbalances, edge cases that never got addressed. Our goal of being able to list lots of playtest credits at the front of the book often outvoted our goal of producing balanced, smart, working design. A big playtest group also has a marketing value of its own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278350/#Comment_278350" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T13:25:23+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  1:25PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, if we want a succint rule-of-thumb, which mixes expectations and feelings:<br/><br/>If it works, I don't care.

It's your problem to choose a course of development that sees your expectations of price and my expectations of quality meet. The only way playtesting enters into this equation is when we apply authorship analysis in our consumption of game texts: the realization that your game sucks because you didn't care to playtest influences the way I see the work; so does the realization that you didn't playtest because you're so green as a game developer that you didn't realize how to do it properly. Thus I might get angry at you for ripping me off or pity you for getting in over your head. It's a good question whether this sort of analysis of your game text reading experience and attribution of details to the design process based on your reading is a worthwhile thing to do as the audience - I find that it helps me understand where a game text is coming from, but it's also sort of secondary in that either the game works for you or it doesn't.<br/><br/>Putting on my game designer hat, I have to say that I don't much care for the playtesting groupthink/orthodoxy - but then, I don't care of any trends that cause mobs. It's not that I don't find playtesting a valuable and potentially unreplaceable tool, but rather that I'd like people to use and acknowledge playtesting because they find it necessary for their goals, not because they fear that Story Games will brand their game and design practice unprofessional for not toeing the line. It's much too easy to call a game bad <i>because</i> it's not playtested, but how can you say that as a critic, really? You can tell us <i>how</i> the game is bad, but whether a playtest routine would have fixed that would depend on how the developer executed the playtests, wouldn't it?<br/><br/>When considering the practice of writing game texts in general, I see interesting directions and possibilities in discarding a monolithic concept of "good design" and embracing the idea that different game texts are written for different purposes, not all of them requiring massive playtest and usability testing and all the other things we associate with commercial games. Our concept of how a game should be for the consumer to not get offended is largely predicated on the idea that games are sold, bought and enjoyed as a simple commercial consumer relationship; in this context "good design" makes sense, as it offers a prescriptive and descriptive framework for why one game floats while another sinks. However, there are other vistas out there, some of which do not conform to simple traditional values of quality. As a simple example I'd like to posit the idea that I myself, personally, don't mind paying money for a game text that is unplaytested and unplayable as long as I can derive other values from it aside from ease of use and guaranteed good game experience. In fact, this is largely how I see much of traditional design: I buy those books for the prose, not the design.<br/><br/>My own playtesting is practically always executed by myself; I don't usually do independent testing aside from giving the game out to some friends to show off and perhaps get some studio critique. This is no matter of principle, but rather of product nature: were I creating games for larger audiences with greater demands of the types of performance that usability testing and audience focus groups can get you, I would do those types of independent testing to the best of my ability. As it is, it is sufficient for me to have absolute clarity in my own head about what it is we do when we play the game; this I can write down and further expand upon with others who'd like to play my game. The sort of high polish that external playtesting gets you is not needed for all products, and mine tend to belong in this category.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278354/#Comment_278354" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T13:32:55+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  1:32PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>I don't care -- not even a teensy little bit -- how you made the gorram game.<br/><br/>Alls I want is a fun game.

Let me know if this is derailing.<br/><br/>Another weird historical example: the first edition of Shock: (as I recall) left out one critical rule necessary to play the game (I don't remember which one, now; I think it was how to determine your starting resource points, but I'm not sure).  Can that kind of small-but-crucial oversight have been discovered during playtesting?  Yeah, but only by testing the text for usability in addition to how the rules work in play, and those are different things.  So sometimes HOW MUCH playtesting is less important that WHAT KIND.<br/><br/>Also, to get at some of Jenskot's point: playtesting won't tell you how long your game text should be unless you decide it's a priority to make it as short and direct as possible and playtest it with that in mind.  It also won't tell you that you've done all you can with this project and just need to suck it up and release it before you drive yourself batshit insane. Successful playtesting is often subjective because people are trying to test different things and refine their games with different goals in mind.<br/><br/>So really the fact that you have done X amount of playtesting doesn't really tell your audience that much.  I mean, clearly D&amp;D4 was playtested like crazy and they still couldn't figure out that only spending 1 Action Point per Encounter completely invalidated at least 50% of the reasons to have Action Points in the first place.  More playtesting doesn't necessarily make for a better game; it really depends on what the designer takes from the playtesting.<br/><br/>All in all, it would probably be good for everyone if we started talking about playtesting in terms other than the <i>amount</i> you do or the <i>length of time</i> it takes.  I mean, I'm as guilty of this as anyone, so this goes for me as well.  Hopefully these few threads can be a beginning of that and my post here seems to be chiming in with what a lot of folks are saying anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278366/#Comment_278366" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T13:59:27+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  1:59PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 28, 2010 2:00PM by jenskot.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If anyone is interested in Usability Testing (playtesting), I highly recommend...<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy-Yourself/dp/0321657292" rel="nofollow">Rocket Surgery Made Easy: The Do-It-Yourself Guide to Finding and Fixing Usability Problems</a><br/>\n(short but entertaining)<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.amazon.com/Landing-Page-Optimization-Definitive-Conversions/dp/0470174625/" rel="nofollow">Landing Page Optimization: The Definitive Guide to Testing and Tuning for Conversions</a><br/>\n(detailed but dry)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnrelated to playtesting but useful for making your text and layout design more usable (it's geared towards websites but I find most of it univeraslly applicable especially since how people use websites is slowly changing how people use books and with more e-readers the lines are further blurred):<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758/" rel="nofollow">Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278385/#Comment_278385" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T15:34:06+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  3:34PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>When you buy a game, how much playtesting do you expect?

I think you can forgive a slip up on one if the game is outstanding in other respects (Misery Bubblegum). That isn't an excuse not to playtest. A game breaking down half-way through because the system has not been properly playtested is a very big negative. In particular, playtesting by people unknown to you who get their actual play experience by reading your text and attempting to decode your game is essential.<br><br>Playtesting delays publication and is time consuming. It can be irritating for publishers and writers. It can be hard to find playtesters - but it's an essential part of game design. <br><br>If I'm releasing a new game with novel mechanics, I want a ten or more playtest reports; this means at least twenty volunteer groups. This can be hard to achieve. For supplements for writers less familiar with a system, about five or six reports will do the trick. For experienced writers writing supplements they for systems they understand, fewer. Ideally, you will have people completely unfamiliar with your products playtesting. This can be very hard to achieve, and is an ideal. However, if you can't raise a few playtest groups for your game, is your premise grabby enough? Is your copy doing what it should? Are you posting in all the places you can?<br/><br/>I'm not sure what you mean by "paying for it." If a game is badly written poorly laid out, or not well illustrated, you can tell pretty much straight away.Bad design and a lack of playtesting are usually emergent properties of play. If a game is published, and I'm expected to pay for it, I will be very disappointed if it's not properly playtested.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278386/#Comment_278386" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T15:43:22+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  3:43PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite><br/>Alls I want is a fun game.

That person should be able to read and understand the rules to the extent that he or she can then teach other people (people who are often less interested in the game than the original reader) to play the game.  Then, the whole group comes out feeling like any deficiency in play is their problem, not the rules.<br/><br/>This is because I am often the one pitching new games to people.  The thing I hate most about being in that role is when a game lets my group down.  So if the rules are coherent and lend themselves to fulfilling the promise in-fiction that the game makes, I'm happy.  I don't care how long you playtested it or with whom, I just expect it to work as promised.<br/><br/>If it's a game that promises fiction about a particular thing or particular stories and we do our best to apply ourselves to that then the mechanics need to do their part, too.  If they don't, you fucked me out of my money.  Five dollars, three dollars, forty dollars.  Whatever.  <br/><br/>Now, if I'm paying a tonne of money, that extra money needs to be paying for cool extras.

One of the first full playtests I ran of Blowback was for Epidiah Ravachol, Vincent Baker, Ben Lehman, and Emily Care Boss. Everyone had a total blast. It's a good thing I recorded it; when I was getting seriously burnt out on my game, I'd skip to a part of it and hear these AWESOME PEOPLE having an AWESOME TIME and be like, whoa, this is something special, I better do it right.<br/><br/>As a consumer, my thoughts on playtesting are pretty similar to John's: I want a text that delivers the experience you sell me on. Do you know the one playtester name that will put me over the edge on whether or not I'll buy a book? <b>Moreno Roncucci.</b> Moreno is not just a fantastic guy who knows how to run a game, English is his second language, and he always, <i>always</i> sends polite, insightful critique and questions about your game text after he playtests it. If Moreno plays it and gives you feedback, and you revise your game based on that feedback, then your text is great. AND if he ENJOYS your game? He will bring it to a slew of people who never would have seen it otherwise. <br/><br/>That's a digression though. My point is, I think text-based playtesting is the most important kind you can do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278400/#Comment_278400" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T16:21:21+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  4:21PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno.

In other words, I want to know those last "playtests" were "APs", so to speak.<br/><br/>Besides, I am not really interested in <i>who</i> playtested a game when I pick it up.

I don't just want the designer having made a game where it is possible that I'm in the right group to enjoy this game. I want the designer to have done some serious work on how the game fails to be fun when the group does something unexpected and makes sure that those other types of play will tend to be enjoyable as well. Only then will the game actually be robustly designed. <br/><br/>I strongly suspect that playtesting alone isn't enough to accomplish that, but I like trying to push for more rather than just repeating what has already been done. <br/><br/><br/><br/>More generally I've found playtesting as an unreliable advertisement. I've been surprised often enough by games that came together well despite little in the way of testing, and games with a wealth of testing that fell down hard. This applies to specific people too. I suspect this has much to do with the fact that I tend to run games with folks trained outside of either standard traditional or standard indie expectations, and with other unusual audiences. For example, Eppy may be a great playtester, but does that translated to this game playing well with this particular all-female group? <br/><br/>More and more these days I've been getting shy of indie games, from having too often had troubles. More often I've just been custom designing or adapting a game for the group in question, to suit their interests and requirements, But that really is another matter entirely. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278408/#Comment_278408" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T17:05:12+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  5:05PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>That's a digression though.

One, do the rules and the system do what they promise to do?  Two, does the text of the game accurately communicate the rules and the system?  When I buy a game, I expect that for both of these questions the answer will be "yes."  As far as other types of play working (as mentioned by wyrmwood), I don't have requirements that are that stringent; although if there are failure conditions where the game becomes not-fun, I'd expect that they should either be fairly obvious (trying to use a gritty game to play a pulp hero unironically, for instance) or called out in the game text.<br/><br/>The price point affects what my expectations are.  In the case of Gun Thief, for $5 I expected a game that would give me at least half an hour of enjoyment out of reading it, with maybe a cool idea or two that I could use elsewhere.  (I got a lot more than that, but that's what my expectations were.) <br/><br/>As far as how much playtesting, well, that's a tough one.  There needs to be enough playtesting so that if there are flaws in the rules and system making good on their promise, or if the rules text does not accurately communicate the rules and system, that it is discovered and fixed.  But whether that is twenty groups playing four sessions each or the right two people reading the text and commenting on it is impossible to say.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278948/#Comment_278948" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-01T11:23:51+00:00" title="July  1, 2010 11:23AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am of the thought that to much playtesting can be a bad thing.
