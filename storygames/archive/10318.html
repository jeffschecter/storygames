I don't post here very often but I do lurk fairly frequently. <br/><br/>Biblio the card game<br/><br/>Is a custom card game where all the cards display images of various book covers. It's kind of like Supertrumps (I think) except that when two players play cards against each other they have to use the themes/ideas/plot/content of the book they have to argue for a victory over the opposing players book card. So essentially it's a game of semi-structured yelling about books you may or may not know anything about for fun. How to determine a victorious argument??<br/><br/>I'm not really into rules sets so I'm after suggestions on possible ideas or engines to make this playable.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229414/#Comment_229414" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T16:37:14+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  4:37PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2009 4:37PM by Graham.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is fantastic!<br/><br/>You should have a list of things you can use to beat the other book with.

My hope in posting here was to draw from the pool of genius game heads that is story-games to help turn my little idea into a game. <br/><br/>I like the two decks idea. It certainly makes it playable. I was planning to include non-fiction too so we might need to make the categories a bit broader. Broadening the categories would also allow for more argument. It seems kinda counter-intuitive but I do want a fair bit of ambiguity in order to foster good arguments. In other words you should be able to beat Kafka with Judy Bloom if you can put enough spin on it (well maybe not).<br/><br/>More ideas welcome below.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229702/#Comment_229702" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T16:26:43+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  4:26PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stephen's idea about a third-party judge seems like a good one to me.

I've been really concerned about this issue and that's whats been holding me back from really gettting going.<br/><br/>So, if a book is public domain does that mean all it's covers are too? There may still be issues in relation to ownership of the artwork. It's a very messy issue. What about making my own covers (or hiring other artists) would that mean I could use anything or only public domain stuff. Not exactly the most fun part of the design but I seem to need some resolution on it before I'll commit to putting more time into it.\n<blockquote>Also, would you prefer comments on the blog or here?</blockquote>\nI'm happy with either. I actually prefer forums so I reckon just go with the thread of the conversation, wherever that may be happening.<br/><br/>In regards to number of players I think I'll aim for two player to start with just to keep it simple with a view to working on rules for more players down the road.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bevedog" title="bevedog"><img alt="bevedog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stevelawson.name/icons/steve-in-3D-32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bevedog">bevedog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233956/#Comment_233956" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-23T15:42:21+00:00" title="September 23, 2009  3:42PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite><cite>Posted By: bevedog</cite>It just occurred to me that you will have a massive intellectual property problem with book covers as a major game element.

But, yes, there's game potential in just titles and authors.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, in the USA, it's not public domain unless it was <a href="http://www.unc.edu/~unclng/public-d.htm" rel="nofollow">published prior to 1923</a>. So yeah, Shakespeare is in the public domain, but all the book covers slapped on the Bard since 1923 are still copyrighted. And since <i>The Great Gatsby</i> is often thought of as the book with the first really memorable cover, and that was published in 1925, there just won't be public domain book covers, I'm afraid.<br/><br/>I don't want to be a downer--this sounds like a game I would buy--but if part of the fun is recognizable book covers, I fear it won't work.<br/><br/>(Also, while I have dealt with copyright in my job as a librarian, I'm not a lawyer, and if someone can show me I'm wrong that would be cool.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
