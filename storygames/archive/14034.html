It is a post-apocalyptic primitive utopia game, so each player picked a real local landmark to be important in play.  Then each other player proposed how the location changed in the next 400 years.  The player who proposed the location picks the idea that they like best, which becomes the true story of that place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317805/#Comment_317805" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-25T14:34:29+00:00" title="March 25, 2011  2:34PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>What else is there?</blockquote>\nIn a Wicked Age's oracles.<br/><br/>My game <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/final-hour-of-a-storied-age/" rel="nofollow">Final Hour of a Storied Age</a> uses a technique similar to IAWA's oracles (but mine are built up by players from individual word lists rather than authored ahead of time) and ties them together around a genre-appropriate plot structure skeleton.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317807/#Comment_317807" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-25T14:56:49+00:00" title="March 25, 2011  2:56PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2011 3:10PM by J_Walton.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fiasco's playsets are probably the most obvious and effective evolution of Geiger Counter's <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2008/02/28/style-sheets-part-1/" rel="nofollow">style sheet</a> concept, more directly mixed with IAWA oracles along the way and making them, I think, ultimately more effective.<br/><br/>Really, part of the reason I haven't worked on Geiger Counter lately is that I feel like most of what I wanted to say with that game, about the things I like about survival horror movies (2 hours, one-shot, quick punchy premise generation, loose attachment to characters, tight relationships, location-based framing, a few important items, building tension through dice pools, putting characters in bad situations, climax, spiral down to endgame, etc.), Jason also said in Fiasco, so working on it doesn't feel creative and exciting anymore. Eventually, I'll probably have to rip out the core and start over with just conditions, the mapping rules, and the menace, which actually sounds pretty fun.<br/><br/>Honestly, I'd probably call all of these "genre emulation" games (though Sorcerer is a bit different), since they share that thing where starting a new game creates a new "instance" of the same general structure, and yet every premise and group of characters is unique.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317808/#Comment_317808" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-25T15:01:54+00:00" title="March 25, 2011  3:01PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PTA as a one-shot is suboptimal.

Actually, you can play "steampunk space" Mountain Witch without changing any of the rules (just writing different traits and going off to kill the Babbage Queen or whatever), so that might be opening the door a bit.<br/><br/>I think, however, that the "punchy consensus premise" is both mythical and kinda a red herring.  It works way better, in my experience, for the GM/facilitator to come in with a concept/playbook/something and then for the players to decide which parts they are interested in and drive towards them.  <br/><br/>Like, I come in saying, "We're playing Mountain Witch, but it's in steampunk space and you're all going off to kill the Babbage Queen. Draw your Darque Fates. What kinds of total badasses are you and where do you meet up, in the process of journeying into the heart of the Peerless Babbite Empire?"  And then one player says, "I'm the captain of the Arc Regal, a piratical steam-barque which runs on the flames of a captured elemental."  And then suddenly we have pirates and elementals, stuff I never expected, but I'm still down because it's still steampunk space Mountain Witch.  <br/><br/>That kind of thing, rather than starting from nothing, is generally much more gripping and effective and that's why, following IAWA, both Geiger and Fiasco went more in that direction.  My sense is that the upcoming 3rd edition of PTA is also pushing more along those lines.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317828/#Comment_317828" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-25T17:04:17+00:00" title="March 25, 2011  5:04PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2011 5:06PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>Do you have any house techniques that your group uses to decide what setting/genre to play next?</blockquote>\nOur process is pretty traditional, I think.<br/><br/>First someone gets the urge to run a game in some particular setting and/or genre, they psych themselves up for it, and then they pitch it to the group to get other people interested.  Nothing gets played if someone isn't already interested in running it: there's no "you need to run a game, like, right now" pressure and no "one of us should totally run this game" nonsense.  Interested applicants only, no conscription.<br/><br/>Then there's at least one session where everyone talks about the game, focusing mainly on what sorts of characters will be in it and what kinds of things they will be doing, plus setting- and genre-specific questions ("Are there zeppelins?").  This is really the most crucial part of the process, it's where the person who's running the game and the people who are playing in it get on the same page with each other.  While it's not explicitly a collaborative effort the way a PTA pitch session might be, there's a lot of feedback running in both directions, and people aren't shy about advocating for particular things they want or pushing back on things they don't want.  The person running the game obviously starts out more invested in the setting and establishes most of the details (in whatever way they typically like to do that), but it'd be ridiculous to think that the players aren't getting a lot of input into everything.<br/><br/>During the game, many times players will introduce setting elements or otherwise push the envelope of what's already been established (some more than others, based on personal preference and how comfortable they feel with that particular setting), and most of the time the GM just picks that stuff up and runs with it.  If for some reason that doesn't happen, there's the expectation that a reason will be given ("No, actually, this is after the Hindenburg burned, so there aren't really that many zeppelins left and there's no big zeppelin pilot union" or whatever).<br/><br/><br/>In the past, we've tried out other ways of doing things, but it never worked out for us.<br/><br/>Having the group sit down and brainstorm a setting together was fun, but a complete disaster in play; it just led to a game where everyone just kind of liked the setting, but no one LOVED it, and we've found that for our games to really hum, we need at the very least a GM who LOVES the game.  We have a lot of slow-burn players who need a few sessions to get a handle on their character and the setting and really connect with it, and without someone enthusiastic to sit at the head of the table and encourage that, things bog down.<br/><br/>Taking a setting from someone else (trying to use a prepackaged setting without any modifications, using a "shared world" setting with other groups, etc.) runs into the same problem; the GM rarely loves the setting, is visibly less enthusiastic about running the game than we're used to, and it drops the energy level of the whole table.<br/><br/>On the opposite side, way back when we were younger and stupider, we had a few experiences with overly-autocratic GMing.  Not surprisingly, a GM who loves his setting too much to ever let the players affect even the tiniest corner of it turns out to be a recipe for a terrible, terrible game.  No feedback and collaboration is perhaps even more deadly to our fun than too much collaboration.<br/><br/>Generally, we tend to do best with games run by someone who has a clear idea of what kind of game they really and truly want to be running, can share that idea with everyone else, and can leave enough room and flexibility to incorporate the very best ideas brought forward by everyone.  We want a strong and committed director who knows how to listen, I guess.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317829/#Comment_317829" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-25T17:17:23+00:00" title="March 25, 2011  5:17PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You say "punchy consensus premise" like this conversation has already been played out and labeled on another thread somewhere.

Other People's Settings usually make my eyes glaze over - and I don't think I'm weird in that way ... what's the saying, "Nobody loves our children like we do, and that's particularly true when the children are ideas?" <br/><br/>Though I'd play Babbage Queen in a second...  hmm, is that because I tossed out "steampunk" and "space" as seed content and therefore feel like it's still somehow mine or because you're a badass GM?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317841/#Comment_317841" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-25T19:11:43+00:00" title="March 25, 2011  7:11PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My D&amp;D setting has been mostly DM-improv as we go.<br/><br/>I suspect the pros and cons of that are self-evident, but if you have any questions, shoot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317845/#Comment_317845" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-25T19:24:32+00:00" title="March 25, 2011  7:24PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Im right in the middle of a second draft of my game - working my way through setup which is relevent to your thread, so tell me what you think:<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B5W32IfgIIkrOWYxNjg2MDEtZWQ0OS00YmIxLTk5ZTYtNDVmZjY0NWMyYjY3&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CLaJ4P4J" rel="nofollow">ingenero second draft</a><br/><br/>Looks better if you download it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317853/#Comment_317853" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-26T00:20:13+00:00" title="March 26, 2011 12:20AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We tried an experiment inspired by Shock: tonight - the first one, where we all wrote down premises or settings and then tried to mash them up, didn't work, because our settings were all incompatible. We couldn't figure out how to mix "Haight/Ashbury in the sixties" with "Turn of the century - gaslight."<br/><br/>So then we tried writing one or two evocative words on two flash cards and see how many we could get in the setting.<br/><br/>Our words:<br/>Orgone<br/>Espionage<br/><br/>Submarines<br/>Lighthouse<br/><br/>Submarine<br/>Volcano<br/><br/>(Yeah, my friends both picked submarine(s)...what's up with that?)<br/><br/>So ... it nearly could have been Spy Who Loved Me, but "Submarine" instead of "Submarines" made us think of underwater civilization, and Orgone made us think of a whole different species. So we zeroed in on a nuclear sub (with a russian spy on-board) on a diplomatic mission to visit the Orgonians - a race of orgone-infused fish-men that had just made violent contact with the USA at a particular lighthouse. The lighthouse keeper was on-board as well, the one human who had met Orgonians and lived...<br/><br/>So, success, I think. After we'd set things up, one friend said, "I could just do this over-and-over all night."<br/>So after we finished playing we had time to set another one up just for fun. That one turned out to be a Victorian-era story about a mining company that was causing sinkholes in the neighboring area, opening up a network of caverns ... and unleashing some kind of phantom (or maybe the phantoms were invented by the company to scare people away, so they wouldn't realize the company was culpable ... scooby doo) ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317856/#Comment_317856" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-26T04:55:02+00:00" title="March 26, 2011  4:55AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            HeroQuest suggests using questionnaires to create the background for the PCs community, and from those choices determining the resources the community has in addition to its history. There is an example in the rulebook. Sartar, Kingdom of Heroes has a clan questionnaire for setting up the background for an Orlanthi clan in Sartar - the PCs make choices about the clan's mythic history, ancient history and recent events. Earlier versions of the same idea appeared in Hero Wars and the Gloranthan computer game King of Dragon Pass. It's a way to allow the PCs some kind of choice around what stances their community holds to setting elements, rather than setting elements. We also find its useful for running through the background for the PCs in a way that is more interesting than reading it aloud, or creating handouts.<br/><br/>Diaspora has 'cluster generation' where each person at the table (including the GM) gets to design one of more systems within the cluster in turn. You can use anything from random dice rolls to whim to figure out system characteristics, the creativity comes from setting aspects on the system and creating some kind of narrative that explains that system and the whole cluster. Works well in play and we came up with some interesting ideas that meshed together far better than I thought they might. <br/><br/>Houses of the Blooded gives players the right to narrate 'facts about the world' for successes in contests - these leads to 'on the fly' situation and setting generation. As a GM you really have to roll with the punches on this one, as you might have been juggling a whole set of facts that have happened in game into some shape in your head when someone introduces a dramatic twist that turns that perception on its head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_317861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317861/#Comment_317861" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-26T08:10:32+00:00" title="March 26, 2011  8:10AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Smallville's Pathways system creates the player characters, all of their supporting characters and locations, and significant non-player characters and lays them out in a relationship map. The system itself is inspired by flowchart-style lifepath chargen such as that in Rogue Trader. The relationship map is entirely collaborative and the GM (Watchtower) does not, by default, have anything to do with it other than to advise or coach new players on the process. In a sense, like PTA and to a lesser extent Fiasco, the players at the table are creating their own spinoff campaign and identifying all of their key conflicts and characters in the first session. Watchtower takes the map and uses it during prep to determine what characters to create that can drive wedges between PCs and drive up the conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nDresden Files, of course, has a similar process whereby the group creates the city in which the campaign will take place, determines important aspects that make the city interesting, which leads into actual chargen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317869/#Comment_317869" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-26T10:44:58+00:00" title="March 26, 2011 10:44AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>Oh, but has anyone used the "Collaboratively make your playset on index cards" idea with Fiasco?

I mean, you can talk about it all you want before hand, but the minute the First Player sets the opening scene, that's cannon.  It's nice to have the rules set so clearly.<br/><br/>Remember Tomorrow you get to establish whatever you want, and a few times we've had seemingly cotradictory cannon, but when you get them introduced and established, they smash into one another and gel into something nice.  You can let the dice hammer out any arguments there.<br/><br/>But my favorite way to introduce setting is still The Mountain Witch.  The Dark Fates give you retroactive continuity and flashbacks.  There's a wicked chess-match of "oh no, you may have believed her to be your sister, however..." etc.  Admittedly, I'm partial to it probaby because it was my introduction to this kind of stuff.  Before that, it was all pre-established fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
