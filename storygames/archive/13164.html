For example, leveling &amp; learning skills and untapping Nature by delivering prologues. The feeling of learning a new skill or needing that 1 test to level up is such an integral part of the Mouse Guard experience for me. If I lose this fight to get that last failed test... I'm going to be better for it! I want that in my con games.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Skills:</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI gave everyone pre-generated characters (the original 4: Lieam, Kenzie, Saxon, Sadie... but 40 years in the future deep into retirement). I pre-filled out both failed and passed test for most of their Stats, Skills, and even skills they were learning. In most cases they either needed 2 failed tests or 2 successful tests or 1 failed and 1 successful test to level up a skill. And the impact was well beyond what I expected. As a GM, seeing a player try to fail a Weather Watcher test to level up was glorious... and fantastic for adding unexpected twists to an already highly dramatic game!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Prologue &amp; Nature:</b><br/>\n<br/>\nI then tapped everyone's Nature by 1 and gave one player the option to read a pre-written prologue to themselves and then deliver it however they want to the group to untap their Nature.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Choices:</b><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally to capture the feeling of playing the last session of a hard fought campaign... I gave everyone a choice to determine what happened to them before the game started.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, Lieam's player chose how Gwendolyn died.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game opened in the late fall of 1190 with winter coming early... crop killing frosts, ice storms, starving predators inching closer and the scent border dying... and finally terror from the skies besieging Lockhaven!<br/>\n<br/>\nLieam's player had a choice...<br/>\n<br/>\n1. You tear through your enemies to reach Gwendolyn to comfort her as she dies in your arms (mark Injured: left hand chopped off, gain the Scarred trait, and your goal is \u201crebuild the Territories in Gwendolyn\u2019s name\u201d)<br/>\n<br/>\nOR<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Watch Gwendolyn fall to her death as your enemies hold you down (mark Angry and Tired and your goal is \u201cthe Territories are lost, only revenge matters now\u201d).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a success in every possible way. I can't express how happy I was! Everyone's investment was off the charts and 3 hours later... it felt like finishing a campaign!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296486/#Comment_296486" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-11T09:15:27+00:00" title="October 11, 2010  9:15AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br>I've always wanted to try something like that but I gear my con scenarios for beginners.
