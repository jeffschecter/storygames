We briefly discussed the points in the book about the Captain influencing the missions but I don't think I have a strong understanding of what this actually entails.  <br/><br/>I've seen Gregor mention that he imagines it kind of like a D&amp;D campaign where the players start to decide what town they're visiting, but that doesn't completely gel with me.  <br/><br/>Formally, I'm not really sure what to offer control over to the Captain.  I prepped the next mission/planet but should I allow the Captain to actually choose their objective?  Should he choose the planet name?  Should he just be able to alter the mission details (How about we get two heavy weapons squads as backup?)?  I don't mind giving up some of mission prepping to the player but I don't know how much.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166925/#Comment_166925" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T06:03:52+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  6:03AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I would do, I think, in this situation is to make the planet by the rules, and then create an "intel" packet to give to the Captain's player. Sit down with him and let him read through it, then either roleplay or straight talk, answer any questions he may have that will allow him to determine what the company level mission is. <br/><br/>In real army life, the Captain's influence on the mission is small. He is given a mission by higher, and he chooses how to execute it. In 3:16, he ought to have a little more influence than that, I think. Give him the overall planetary mission (destroy all life, of course, but with some vague additionals) such as resource gathering, photo ops... hell, there's a whole thread to mine for ideas. Just take one of those, vague it up to the point that it encompasses the entire 3:16, and give it to the Captain with the planet brief.<br/><br/>Remember, also, that a Captain runs 3-4 platoons, one of which may be the platoon that contains the rest of the players' squad. The rest of the players, depending on rank, may be the Captain's personal security detachment, or platoon leaders (LTs) in their own right. Just the business of running 3-4 platoons can give them a greater impact over the course of the mission than a single platoon leader. <br/><br/>Also, a captain on the ground is more fun to play than one who sits with his finger on a button back in orbit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166926/#Comment_166926" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T06:04:18+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  6:04AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 4, 2008 6:05AM by renatoram.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, for one, the mission and the planet are not the same thing: sure, if the mission is "go and exterminate" they overlap. But take a look at the thread about 3:16 missions here on s-g. You as the GM could hand to the Captain the formal data of the planet (those you roll on the planet tables), and then let him choose what mission to assign to each platoon (one of which will be his command squad, i.e. the players).<br/><br/>It can range form infiltration to extraction, to tactical support to investigation... to defending the ship while it is rammed by a giant space hulk <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--EDIT--<br/>Damn, ninja'ed! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Or, in other words, what Wolfe said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166928/#Comment_166928" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T06:44:38+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  6:44AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me you don't want him to go up to Captain or something. My advice is simply to let that stuff go.<br/><br/>What were you, as GM, doing for mission briefings? What missions were you having them do? Pass that over to the Captain's player. He's the Captain now. He has to wipe out your Threat Tokens, how's he going to do it? Up to him.<br/><br/>You now get to be a Lt Colonel asking the Captain for better results, higher KPIs (Key Performance Indicators -- kills per planet, lower percentage losses of men and resources) and asking him what the hell he thought he was doing using all the heavy assault units in a pincer movement for?<br/><br/>See, as GM you just get to role-play the higher ups and the aliens. Fun! You get to pick the planet and demand the Captain comes up with a plan to cleanse it. Then he's got to sell his plan to the Troops below him. (And we all now know who to blame when it goes wrong!)<br/><br/>And when someone gets to Lt Colonel you can hand him the planet sheet (he gets names and planet types, even alien types -- I'm sure the scanners will detect those). You get to pick the AA and Special Ability. Easy.<br/><br/>Lance's advice is great, and comes from experience, so I'm going with what he says when I get a Captain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166930/#Comment_166930" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-04T06:54:43+00:00" title="September  4, 2008  6:54AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<em>what the hell he thought he was doing using all the heavy assault units in a pincer movement for</em><br/><br/>Ha!

I thought you actually implied this in the text: once you go up in ranks you can scale the battles up indefinitely. So have the Captain (or Major, or whatever) command the Ship, place the grunts in charge of manning the hull cannons, and maybe have them go out in space for assaulting... and do a big space battle as a Planet.<br/><br/>Or, use entire mechanized platoons, panzers, mechas, whatever. Each npc is one of them... but also each Threat Token!
