I don\u2019t know how many people bought it when it was released in 2002, but I was one of them and I was well aware of the controversy surrounding its release.<br/><br/>The argument against <i>Afghanistan: d20</i> was that it was somehow disrespectful to the troops fighting there to make a game of their hardships and, yes, their deaths.  My perspective was that we have successfully made games out just about any war you care to think of, from WWI to Vietnam.  Some have been wargames, some roleplaying games, but they were all still <i>games</i>.  Did these efforts, too, qualify as disrespectful?<br/><br/>I guess on the one hand I can kind of see the argument against a roleplaying game.  With a wargame things are abstracted.  The death of one or a dozen or a hundred is just numbers on a sheet of paper.  Properly executed, a roleplaying character has a life of his or her own and that character\u2019s death is going to be felt more acutely as a result.  Assuming the player is the empathetic sort.  Some aren\u2019t.<br/><br/>In a less touchy-feely but more practical sense, there\u2019s the argument that there is little to <i>do</i> in an <i>Afghanistan: d20</i> campaign.  I believe this comes from a perspective that doesn\u2019t see the United States\u2019 involvement in Afghanistan as a fully fledged <i>war</i>, but as some kind of low-intensity peacekeeping mission.  War is full of plot hooks, as anyone who\u2019s run a WWII game or the like can tell you.<br/><br/>At any rate, America\u2019s war in Afghanistan has become our longest.  It seemed like the right time to look at <i>Afghanistan: d20</i> and review not only the controversial origins of the supplement, but what we can do with it now to tell meaningful stories.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the first thing we have to do is look at the changing face of the Afghanistan conflict.  What was at the time of <i>Afghanistan: d20</i>\u2019s writing a battle to oust the Taliban from power has now turned into a counterinsurgency effort, with the guerrilla Taliban using the porous border between Afghanistan and Pakistan to strike into areas the US and Afghani militaries cannot defend adequately.  Meanwhile, Afghanistan\u2019s part in the global opium trade has expanded dramatically.  We\u2019re fighting a drug war, not just a war against a human enemy.<br/><br/>Our primary responsibility would seem to be drawing out the human elements of the war as it\u2019s being fought.  US operations are increasingly adrift in a sea of growing responsibility, while in the wilder expanses of Afghanistan the people are torn between the bad old days of Taliban rule and the corrupt regime the United States supports.  It seems to me that that there\u2019s plenty of low-hanging fruit to be picked here without even having to delve deeply into the combat part of things.<br/><br/>We also have to acknowledge that Afghanistan is something special.  Our longest war, as I said.  As we endlessly recycle soldiers in deployment after deployment, what questions arise?  Is it possible or even advisable to expand the scope of an <i>Afghanistan: d20</i> game to include the home front?<br/><br/>And while we\u2019re on the subject, what about the <i>Afghani</i> home front?  <i>Afghanistan: d20</i> provides for homegrown character types that needn\u2019t be as extreme as \u201cTerrorist Cell Leader\u201d (a prestige class).  What sorts of stories could we tease out of the situation by taking the view of enemies and bystanders?<br/><br/>Basically I think there\u2019s a lot of life and relevance left in <i>Afghanistan: d20</i>.  Clearly we could go on arguing its propriety, but I\u2019d rather talk about the things we\u2019d do with it and the ends to which our efforts are put.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284942/#Comment_284942" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-09T11:26:56+00:00" title="August  9, 2010 11:26AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Complex post-colonial politics, an ancient and de-centralized civilization thrown into repeated conflict with different cultures, guerrilla warfare, some of the most challenging and magnificent geography on earth, internecine power struggles and religious extremism.

But my experience with d20 (which is piles and piles) is that d20 games are primarily about combat, physical challenges and using skills to overcome obstacles. <br/><br/>That's good for an adventuring party game (D&amp;D), and maybe it's good for a small military unit skirmish/tactics game, but I don't think that's the game you want to play set in modern-day Afghanistan. If you want "soldiers busting heads" then something fictional or historic seems appropriate, but not a war zone where soldiers and civilians are dying as a result of that stuff.<br/><br/>I'm not saying you CAN'T do it, I'm just questioning whether or not d20 is a good tool for the job.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284967/#Comment_284967" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-09T14:04:13+00:00" title="August  9, 2010  2:04PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, if you don't want to be the guy who rolls a sweet crit against Osama bin Laden with a C15, then Afghanistan d20 might not be the game for you.

I think the best reflection of the d20 aesthetic would be to follow a group of a special ops soldiers, or at least a small, well-trained cadre, on missions into difficult territory in the country.  Some missions could involve dealing with hard terrain well away from home base and a hit-and-run assaults by Taliban forces, while another could involve befriending and recruiting a crucial village under pressure from the self-same Taliban.<br/><br/>Combat would seem to be at the heart of things, because that's arguably what d20 does best.  I can see at least one adventure where the characters venture into Pakistan on a secret mission to capture or kill a high-value target, surrounded on all sides by enemies and forced to do things quietly without openly violating the peace that exists between the US and Pakistan.<br/><br/>The sample adventure gives some indication of how the game is to be used, and reflects some of what I've said already.

Most of them, at least the ones carrying rifles in battles, are young men, mostly uneducated, heavily influenced by system that does not actually help them or even consider their well-being. They're not orcs, which in-game heroes can destroy with ethical impunity. They're, you know, real people, even if they are also combat enemies of the United States.<br/><br/>Again, I can see the possibility of a d20 game that acknowledges these things, but I think it would trend heavily towards picking off guards with sniper rifles and knifing sentries and other bad-ass war-movie stuff.

So, in the accepted American historical view, the Afghan jihadis were the good guys in 1982, but they're the bad guys in 2010. But history is complicated. They're the same guys, for the most part.<br/><br/>Unless you're talking about a game where <b>that's the point</b>. Let's follow the character Omar and tell his story as an 18-year-old mujahedeen, and then as a 43-year-old Taliban commander, and see what we learn about him. Tricky! But probably a really powerful game experience. I don't know. I don't usually play games like that, but I can see the appeal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

The focus in the classes/prestige classes presuppose that you'll take the roles of professional soldiers \u2014 which means Americans, British or Russians, depending on the time frame \u2014 though there's some stuff, like the Clergy and Smuggler classes, that are clearly meant to be occupied by Afghans.<br/><br/>Probably the best example of how the book approaches the topic of US/Afghan relations is in the sample adventure.  The mission is similar to what I've outlined before: small unit with a specific target individual in mind for capture.  The PCs run across different sorts of Afghani NPCs as the adventure progresses, from an Afghan who sees the American war effort as an opportunity to improve the lot of his people, another whose field has been mined and wants help with that (but no other interaction with the PCs), and a hero of the Soviet war who sees the Americans as no different than the Russians.  There's also a man who supports the Taliban because they brought "peace" of a sort, but isn't a zealot.  And we haven't even gotten to the clear bad guys of the scenario yet.<br/><br/>Clearly <i>Afghanistan: d20</i> wants to bring moral ambiguity to what might otherwise be a series of interchangeable military adventures no different from Vietnam or WWII Europe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285510/#Comment_285510" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T11:35:07+00:00" title="August 11, 2010 11:35AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

I'm not saying anything most people don't already know when I point out that Average Americans don't have a really clear set of reasons for supporting (or not) the war.  Who exactly are we fighting anymore?  Why can't we just win and come home?  Are we there because of Osama Bin Laden?  Have we avenged 9/11 yet?  Are we trying to stop the drug trade?  Lots of questions, but very few answers.<br/><br/>Anyone choosing to GM <i>Afghanistan: d20</i> is going to have to come to the table with at least a rudimentary idea of what those answers are because they'll need to be built into the narrative.  "I don't know," isn't a valid response when someone comes to you in-character or out looking for clarification of purpose.<br/><br/>To a certain extent this reminds me a little of that thread about gaming with an intent to instruct.  You <i>have</i> to have a stance when playing this game, even if you're open to having that stance challenged or altered by the experience.

Start with bored contractors constructing a military base they know they will be abandoned, surrounded by an enemy who knows all they have to do to win is wait. Have an interesting conflict (not necessarily shooting-people-related, but maybe so) Chapter 2 is 1987.  Maybe you're villagers trying to cope with Soviet occupiers, or Soviet assholes stealing heroin from a big syndicate.  Chapter 3 is 1928, the revolution against Amanullah Khan. The characters are criminals trying to make a deal with the revolutionaries to provide guns in exchange for safe passage for heroin.  Chapter 4 is 1919, the Anglo-Afghan War. The characters are agents for an influential Afghani tribal council whose job is to get as much gold from the English and Russians as possible under false pretenses.  <br/><br/>And so on, back into history forever.<br/><br/>We could call it The Great Game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_285515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285515/#Comment_285515" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T11:44:32+00:00" title="August 11, 2010 11:44AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JDCorley,<br/><br/> That would be a pretty awesome game.<br/><br/>ara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285523/#Comment_285523" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T12:09:11+00:00" title="August 11, 2010 12:09PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2010 12:09PM by Andy.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, unfortunately I think a game of contemporary d20 Afghanistan would be pretty boring, if my friend Mike's experience is any indicator.

What would that make my character class, a Dillitante level 8 or so?<br/><br/>For the first 15 sessions, I'd just kind of sit around doing freeform roleplaying, working with locals to plant and establish their infrastructure, remove corruption from local politics, try to get the tribes working together, coordinating peace efforts, etc.<br/><br/>Then, in the last session, the GM kicks it up a notch by having tribal insurrectionists storm the NPO compound, shooting everyone. I'd get pulled out to safety after taking rounds to the chest and arms, and losing my left eye due to shrapnel. The two soldiers in the group (lv 10 each) would drop to -10 HP and die, but me and the other players would make it out alive. Then I'd spend 2d4 months recovering, during which my character would decide that it's probably best to leave.

Much of war is waiting for the violence to come, which doesn't exactly translate into slam-bang action roleplay.  For some people the violence doesn't come at all.  See: the same problem as before.<br/><br/>So I suppose it depends on what you're trying to get out of the game.  Are you looking for military action against a contemporary backdrop?  This setting can oblige.  Want some moral ambiguity to go with that?  Help yourself.  And if you're particularly creative, some of what you describe above <i>can</i> be fodder for roleplay.  Maybe not moment-to-moment roleplay, but in a "time passes" way that builds connections between the characters and the NPCs.  That could be genuinely rewarding, and something of a pushback against those who claim d20 can only be used for fighting battles.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285530/#Comment_285530" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T12:36:34+00:00" title="August 11, 2010 12:36PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one thing people are sort of tiptoing around is that there are massive political differences about the war and any game is going to, in some way, make a political statement about the war, just by saying how it goes.  If I make a game about American contractors ripping off the clueless brass for mountains of cash, that's a political statement even if I use d20 to do it. I have no problems with this because I think all games, no matter how situated, make a political statement, but for some reason others do.  Maybe it's because of the immediacy of this conflict, I don't know.

There's just no two ways about this because there's no agreed-upon narrative concerning this particular war.  It's not WWII, for example.<br/><br/>Just by choosing this particular conflict to game you're making a statement.  That statement is further refined by the quality of the NPCs you put forth, the missions you put in front of the characters and how you handle the end results of those missions.  Clearly the players are going to have their own ideas and input into the equation, but it all starts with the GM and his or her approach to the topic.<br/><br/>I think it's just this question of political statements that got me to bring the book out again.  Certainly I look at it differently now that we've been fighting there for almost ten years than I did in 2002 when I bought it.  And my take on a theoretical game run with it has absolutely been affected by the real world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_285539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/285539/#Comment_285539" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-11T13:03:16+00:00" title="August 11, 2010  1:03PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 11, 2010 2:05PM by Daniel H..">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brian Minter</cite>So, in the accepted American historical view, the Afghan jihadis were the good guys in 1982, but they're the bad guys in 2010.

There are people on both sides who are heroes and assholes, and there is stupidity and brilliance - the whole range of human strengths and failings. Generally, everyone actually involved at the sharp end just wants it to be over and to get the hell out of there. But, as long as they have to be there, they're going to do what they have to do to survive.<br/><br/>If I ran an Afghanistan game, it would be from that standpoint - the characters could be American troops out in some remote mountain outpost or local farmers dragooned into some Taliban warlord's army. I'll boil it down to the endpoint of all the politics and idealism to the experience of the poor guy on the line with the rifle. How's he going to get through the next day? The next patrol? How's he going to deal with the things he's told to do? How's he going to live with himself when it's over?<br/><br/>So this is what I present to the players in such games that I run. They'll bring their own take on things, playing their characters as they like - some want to be Rambo, some want to be the misfit, whatever...and what they do and say makes their characters more real, and may even bring them into conflict. But then the bullets start flying and all the politics and personal shit goes out the window and it's just about living through the next battle, and what they have to do to survive.<br/><br/>It's less about the politics for me than the human experience of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/WAR-Sebastian-Junger/dp/0446556246" rel="nofollow">War</a>, a hell we create for ourselves, and how we survive it and live with it all afterward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287746/#Comment_287746" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T01:05:40+00:00" title="August 20, 2010  1:05AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've just picked up a copy of Afghanistan d20, and I thought I'd share first impressions.  <br/><br/>It is clearly focused on achieving military missions, but in no way reduces to mindless violence.  Interestingly, there is considerable detail on the locals and their split allegiances, as well as peripheral al Qaeda folks - but al Qaeda operatives themselves are given only a cursory description.  It does seem to suggest using the option for mission-based experience.  For example, the first plot hook ("Relief Mission") suggest experience be awarded based on getting the greatest amount of food to the village - given two tactical threats to the delivery.  <br/><br/>I may post more later as I read more thoroughly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Megan" title="Megan"><img alt="Megan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Megan">Megan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287772/#Comment_287772" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T05:14:33+00:00" title="August 20, 2010  5:14AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting ideas.<br/><br/>In some ways, it depends how happy you are with using contemporary events in your games.
