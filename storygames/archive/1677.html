                    Crossposted from my email:<br/><br/>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>RPGNow and DriveThruRPG Merge<br/><br/>Atlanta, GA, Thursday, October 25, 2006 - RPGNow and DriveThruRPG announced today that the two leaders in the digital delivery of electronic roleplaying games have merged together to form a new company called OneBookShelf.<br/><br/>OneBookShelf will continue to operate both the RPGNow and DriveThru websites while a new, fully integrated site is developed that will replace the existing sites. Publishers and titles that were once exclusive to one site will now conveniently be displayed on both sites so rpg fans can find all of their favorite titles on their preferred site.<br/><br/>Steve Wieck explained DriveThruRPG's desire to merge, "Our goal from day one has been to offer consumers their choice of any roleplaying game ever published available for instant download 24/7 world-wide. We will be able to meet that goal sooner by combining forces with RPGNow."<br/><br/>The merger is being treated as a merger of equals with all employees and owners of both companies carrying on with the new OneBookShelf company. DriveThru's latest digital delivery site DriveThruComics is also now part of OneBookShelf.<br/><br/>"The focus of the merger is providing the best experience for rpg fans. Combined with DriveThruRPG, we will now offer consumers over 9,000 titles from over 500 different publishers. Many of the titles have never been available in print or are no longer available in print," said James Mathe at RPGNow.<br/><br/>Both RPGNow and DriveThru will be down for a few hours tomorrow as the content of the sites is cross-listed.<br/><br/>OneBookShelf also announced that it has formed partnerships with the two largest rpg community sites, RPGnet and EN World to operate download stores connected to those community sites. Fans can support their favorite community site by purchasing from the new EN World and RPGnet download stores.<br/><br/>Shannon Appelcline of RPGnet said :"I think it's great for the rpg community that RPGNow and DriveThruRPG are joining forces. Once the new RPGnet download store is unveiled, it will give the RPGnet community even more convenient access to instantly get the best top brand and indie rpg titles available, while supporting RPGnet at the same time".<br/><br/>Russ Morrissey, owner of EN World described the new partnership with OneBookShelf: "This is a winning situation for everyone involved - customers, publishers, OneBookShelf and EN World.  We should have done this years ago!  Now EN World's members can support their favourite publishers and EN World at the same time!  And EN World can support those publishers without worrying about who's buying what where.  In addition, we at EN World get to concentrate on what we do best - D&amp;D news, and a fun community.<br/><br/>"EN World has been a fundamental part of growing the RPG PDF industry from the outset, as a great source of information and reviews for the customers and a fantastic source of marketing for the publishers.  We've decided to partner with OneBookShelf for the operation of the EN World download store because they can provide our community more title choices, from Wizards of the Coast to EN Publishing, to the newest independent publishers, and they can provide the level of customer support to which we feel this wonderful community is entitled."<br/><br/>"We are in discussion with more potential partners as well," said James Mathe of OneBookShelf. "Our goal is to allow all publishers to load their titles with us and be assured that they are reaching every corner of the rpg community world-wide. Publishers can devote their time to creating great content and communicating with their fans."<br/><br/>One consequence of the affiliate stores is that the RPGNow site which had been divided into a main site and an RPGEdge site devoted to small press rpgs will now combine all publishers into a single RPGNow site.                </div>

                            Well, here's hoping it increases my sales. I guess it means that I graduate out of RPGNow Edge by default (a task that Contested Ground Studios had actually just done some weeks ago on merit) and my book is available to the discerning buyers at DTRPG.                        </div>

                            The big PDF sites (including SJGames e23 service) have, in recent years, drifted away from focusing on the products of small, independent publishers (whether d20 or otherwise) and become a steadily growing market for PDF versions of products that are already available in FLGSs, plus some PDF producers like Green Ronin and Malhavoc that have made a name for themselves through solid d20 work. The creation of ghettos for products that sold less copies (like RPGnow's Edge) did little for small press products, forced to share space with horrid d20 crap that should have never seen the light of day.<br/><br/>Personally, I remain rather wary of large PDF distribution services (just like I do of traditional distribution), which demand a substantial cut of sales for what seems, to me, to be very little benefit to me as a small publisher.  I can certainly see the benefit of well-known names and companies selling through them, but I suspect that most small press games will be lost amidst the vast sea of products at sites like that.  Maybe they'll do something as part of the merger that will make the situation more attractive, but I suspect that this will just turn the focus more towards the existing top-selling companies.                        </div>

<br/>
I agree completely. I've had a very poor experience with the Edge. Panty Explosion has sold very well on Drivethru. I don't want it to be shoved into some "Edge" type off brand page where no one will ever find it on this new site.<br/>
<br/>
I'm wary of this merger. I have products listed on both Drivethru and ENWorld. If they are merging with RPGNow what will that mean? For one thing, I know RPGNow requires a fee to list you product. Will I be expected to pay that fee? I really like the way Drivethru opperates. Will I have the same ease of use and good relationship with the management with this new company as I did before? What will happen if this new company suddenly decides it wants a bigger percentage of our sales? These are all things I'm concerned about.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like it was a bigger benefit to me to have my game(s) listed on a few different sites then one big site. But I guess that might not be true. We'll see.                        </div>

<br/>
Its hard to tell. We see a nice number of sales from Drivethru, and we get a huge number of hits from the Drivethru site everyday. I think theres a fair number of people that are discovering Panty Explosion on Drivethru.<br/>
<br/>
That being said I'mm sure theres a fair amount of customers who hear about the game and then go to Drivethru to buy it.                        </div>

What do you mean by this, exactly?<br><br>Do you mean a)RPGnow requires a fee to become a vendor <i>(which they do)</i> or that b)RPGnow requires you to pay a fee whenever you list a new product <i>(which, unless I am mistaken, is only true if you wish to list free products)</i>?<br><br>If the former, why do feel that this is this different from the fee that ENWorld requires to become a vendor? <br><br>If the latter, I'm relatively certain that you are mistaken as I have never been required to pay a fee when listing a new product in the past.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            I meant the former. I know its not different then what ENWorld requires. That wasn't what I was saying. What I want to know is if RPGNOW, as part of this new deal, expects me to pay a fee to become a vendor with them even though I am already a vendor with Drivethru. After reading the email Drivethru sent out to its vendors I didn't see anything that indicated this would be the case, but its still something I'd like to see answered.<br/>

e23, Digital Bookbooth, Lulu, and Arima will be the primary competition remaining, I think. Of which, e23 will probably be the stiffest but that's not saying much, from what I understand.                        </div>

                            I think a combination of Lulu and Directing People to Your Lulu Store will get Lulu more heralded in the RPG world.

<br/>
Smells like monopoly. We'll see.<br/>
<br/>
Having poured over the Private Forum for the last hour I'm a little more comfortable with all this. Most of my questions have been answered. I'm still... not completely sold on the whole thing, but I'm willing to sit back and see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
I've been suprised that so many people have complained about Drivethru. My experience with them has been excellent, especially compared with to RPGNOW. Lets hope this merger fixes problems with both companies.<br/>
<br/>
The one thing I don't like is the incredibly strong pressure to go exclusive. I will not give up sales on e23, Lulu or anywhere else.<br/>

I agree.  I don't like the pressure for exclusivity either.<br><br>I think that their trying to reduce the likelihood of new competitors forming by proactively decreasing the vendor base.                        </br></br></div>

That may be true. Of course, neither of the old parent companies had "RPG" in their names either. It wouldn't be very suprising if whatever the new site is called (because we still don't know) does have "RPG", "game" or another associated word in the title.<br/>
<br/>
Really I think this could go either way. It may be diversification, but it looks like it could very, very easily become monopoly.<br/>
<br/>
Of course that could just be the alarmist in me. I'm willing to wait and see.<br/>
<br/>
But I won't be going exclusive.<br/>

For me?  I browse RPGNow's New Products section every week to see if there's anything worth looking at.  I've bought a fair few things that way.  It would be easier if there was a way to browse that list without the d20 stuff getting in the way though.                        </div>

Um, we are talking about <b>RPG</b>Now and DriveThru<b>RPG</b> merging into OneBookShelf here right?

The company name, yes.

This is true, but it doesn't always make a lot of difference. I've only released one product on RPGNow/Edge/WhathefuckeverIdon'tcare and its been a long, long time since I've had any kind of front-page space. I very much doubt that I could get less front-page space on the new site than I did on the old one.<br><br>I'd be more worried about this for the mid-tier PDF publishers. Someone like Ronin Arts but without the reputation could be hurt by it. For the very small and very big it doesn't make a lot of difference though.                        </br></br></div>

While it may be impossible to get a 'literal' monopoly in a web-based business, there's no denying that there's such a thing as 'eyeball-monopoly'.

This is true, for the moment at least. <br><br>More worriesome from the "actual publishers who work with the sites are talking about it in a not-happy manner" is the current figures being bandied about in terms of commision and pay rates. Right now its looking like many of us are going to lose 5 to 10% extra from each sale to the store front. If sales increase dramatically, this may not matter much in terms of how much we make per month (though it will mean we'll make less than if sales had increased through some other mode, of course) -- but if sales don't increase it could result in a big hit for some folks. <br><br/>Ronin Arts, for example, has stated that if sales don't increase from this merger the current numbers around commision raises could result in the company losing around 5 grand a year (not month, GMS corrected me on this one). Even if sales get a moderate boost they'll only end up breaking even, while the storefront will be making a lot more money. It's only if sales go way way up that Ronin (as I understand it) gets a boost -- and even then, not as big a boost as the distributor. <br/><br/>For a long time now I've thought that when I release more PDF material I would be doing it through Lulu or my own site -- as I haven't been happy with RPGNow for some time. This hasn't changed my opinion yet, but it has made me start looking into software to run my own sales from my site a little more intently.                        </br></br></br></div>

<blockquote>Guys, this isn't monopolization. This is diversification.</blockquote>
I can't speak for Jake, but "it isn't diversification for the <em>vendors</em>" is the point I personally was making.
<blockquote>Right now its looking like many of us are going to lose 5 to 10% extra from each sale to the store front.</blockquote>
I wonder how much of that is geared toward the online vendor trying to make a living. I'm not even going to speculate, but I'm definitely curious. I can't even recall offhand if Brendan at IPR still has a day job, but I'm pretty sure he does. Do the OneBookShelf people? I know that James of RPGNow also runs Game Universe here in the Milwaukee area (which, disturbingly, had a cheesy commercial on during BSG the last couple weeks), but that seems like two halves of the same whole.<br/><br/>Anyway, all this is getting to the idea that maybe the whole online aggregator thing would work well on an economic model similar to that of the DIY game designer (i.e. make nice supplemental money, not all the money). Except you'd have to really like what you're doing in the first place.                        </div>

Currently, I think that this is just unfounded rumor.  It is quite possible that the website folks keep pointing at is just a mock-up created for negotiation purposes with SJ Games.<br/><br/>I would think that SJG would have made an announcement if they were already on board with the new OneBookShelf company.                        </div>

                            I know that some folks will discount me as a shill, since I handle customer service emails for RPGNow, but to clarify:<br/>
<br/>
1) Phil was talking about $5K a YEAR, not per month.<br/>
<br/>
2) The maximum increase in the amount the store is keeping will be 10% (25% current RPGNow non-Gold vendors -- or grandfathered Gold vendors -- to the 35% non-exclusive OneBookShelf vendor rate).    Any publisher who is saying that a 10% increase in overhead will make them raise prices on their product simply had their prices set unrealistically low in the first place.   <br/>
<br/>
3) The merger will, in my opinion (as one of the top 15 publishers at RPGNow), result in increased sales -- due to consumer convenience, and the cross-polination effect of the fans of formerly site-exclusive companies being exposed to other product.   In addition, the new company will be aggressively marketing with the stated purpose of increasing the 11% share that PDF now has of total game sales.    <br/>
<br/>
4) Yes, product diversification is also a goal.   DTRPG had already launched fiction and comics etailing sites, and that will be folded in as well.  I know that negotiations are underway with major comics publishers.   The idea being that someone purchasing a western-themed comic, for example, would be given a suggestion to take a look at western RPGs.   That kind of thing.<br/>
<br/>
5) The data given to EVERY RPGNow publisher (but, sadly and unsurprisingly, ignored by most of them) is that over 50% of sales are driven by direct-link publisher marketing efforts, rather than browsing.   That is site-wide....so that means, by law of averages, that the average includes publishers who don't do ANY direct-link marketing.   For publishers like Adamant, the overwhelming majority of our sales are driven by our own marketing, not browsing -- so we're not worried about getting "lost in the shuffle" against anyone else, since most of our sales are coming from customers following specific links to our products.<br/>

                            Gareth, <br/><br/>Shit, sorry to spread misinformation about the 5k thing. <br/><br/>As I said, I don't see this merger having much of any effect on someone at my level on the chain. As for the effects it will have on the top end folks, I guess we'll have to wait and see. I do, however, have some hope that the long tail issue (links from comics to games and such things) will have some results.<br/><br/>The one point I would disagree with is that having your commision changed shouldn't effect pricing. I know that for me it won't, but I've been saying I'm not having a lot of personal impact from this for some times now. However, I do know a few folks who cut their price point with a pretty fine knife who may have to do some re-figuring of their prices now. Perhaps they were in error in the first place, not realizing what a botique market we're in, but the fact that they did do it and were having success by their standards means that I'm not going to crap on them either. <br/><br/>Of course, it's also highly possible that they'll get over it, change their prices, and not see a drop in sales. I sometimes think that there is too much attention paid to folks who scream that RPGs are too expensive, and that the market can bear a lot more price if the quality is there.                        </div>

                            Hey man, long time no see.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GMSkarka</cite>5) The data given to EVERY RPGNow publisher (but, sadly and unsurprisingly, ignored by most of them) is that over 50% of sales are driven by direct-link publisher marketing efforts, rather than browsing.

I know that I've personally browsed RPGNow a lot. I think that I perhaps bought 1-2 products from browsing in some 4-5 years, but having said that, I'm a total picky fuck. If I wasn't as specific about my needs, I could imagine buying far more things from browsing. I've seen people pop up here and there saying that they browse and buy, so I guess the phenomenon is legit: Not enough to perhaps drive sales in a meaningful way, but enough to be a small factor anyway (I imagine it's much greater for d20 publishers who publish those small supplements in droves: "50 Magical Helms" and the like). In other words, Browser-Buyers and San Dimas High Football Rules!<br/><br/>Reading your above comments about direct-purchases (and how most of your sales come from people going to your site, and then directly to the product's page on RPGNow), though, I have a feeling that people in the future could just as easily be serviced by Lulu or one of those other funky ones (Arima? I think they're Euro, tho) as the new RPGNow thing. The publisher does his best to market, to put up a good front on his business website, and then link to "X" where all the business actually goes down: So now, what should we use for "X"? That's the big question, I guess. Once everything shakes out and OBS has been in full production for a few months, I'd love to see a side-by-side breakdown of what the new OBS site offers for retailers (discounts, order tracking, email lists/PR, live stats, PoD opportunities, yadda yadda) vs what competitors offer. That, plus price considerations, will pretty much determine where people hang their hat I think.<br/><br/>I really sympathize with Phil Reed and the other dudes who do PDF publishing for a living, who are most affected by a rate hike... and yet, the fact that some of them are talking about packing it in altogether?  As if the consideration was, "Either the RPGNow rate sticks forever and ever, or else I will find myself out of business"?  It kinda smells like putting all ones eggs in one basket; Not anticipating change. Or simply relying too heavily on RPGNow.  Say that RPGNow had a shakeup, something happened and for no fault of their own HAD to raise the rates across the board? Then they'd be screwed for not having a backup plan.<br/><br/>Things change. I'm hoping that perhaps some of these long-timers' publishing plans will change to meet their needs as well. Larger supplements instead of smaller ones; smaller supplements instead of larger ones; a greater - or lesser - focus on branding or Game Lines; Less art, or Different art; etc.<br/><br/>I'm feeling like everyone will pull through it. I don't imagine that the online RPG world is so fertile that the extra scrilla that the heads are making are going straight into Bentleys and Crystale- It's probably turning into upkeep on servers, hiring full-time staff, more marketing (hopefully print as well), and Even More Marketing.  Maybe the heads are taking home a nice, fat <b>1K</b> bonus for their troubles (OMG!!! Golden Parachutez!!!). But coming from working at Fortune 100 companies, and having seen the range of corporate excesses and profits to be made, again I'm not smelling the island parties with hip-hop chicks in tight bikinis, doing blow off of diamond-crusted copies of the Player's Handbook.<br/><br/>However, if someone from on high would just come out and say what the extra is going to, I think that would cut through the confusion/ire like a Gamer Katana. If they said "We're planning on putting full-page ads in DRAGON and PC Gamer, and banners on PENNY ARCADE and SomethingAwful", then I think everyone would be like, "Oh, shit, REALLY? Damn... uh, thanks."<br/><br/>So maybe that would help.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite><cite>Posted By: jake richmond</cite>"That may be true. Of course, neither of the old parent companies had "RPG" in their names either. It wouldn't be very suprising if whatever the new site is called (because we still don't know) does have "RPG", "game" or another associated word in the title.</blockquote>
Um, we are talking about<b>RPG</b>Now and DriveThru<b>RPG</b>merging into OneBookShelf here right?  I mean, corporate names will be what they will, but Josh was talking about the name of the storefront, and given the recent jump into ecomics and the like, it seems his point stands.<br/><br/>No, see the name of this new store won't be Onebookshelf, but something else. Onebookshel is the name of the new company that owns whatever the combined site will be called. Yes it dosen't have RPG in the title, but neither did the companies that used to own RPGNOW and Drivethru<br/><br/>
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Wilson</cite><br/>I can't speak for Jake, but "it isn't diversification for the<em>vendors</em>" is the point I personally was making.</blockquote>
I can see that.<br/><br/>
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JonathanWalton</cite>According to Phil Reed, e23 is apparently joining the alliance<a href="http://e23.rpgnow.com" rel="nofollow">as well</a>, though it's not clear on what terms.  Perhaps their products will simply be crosslisted.  I haven't seen an official announcement.</blockquote>
Shit. Is this true? Damn.<br/><br/>
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GMSkarka</cite>5) The data given to EVERY RPGNow publisher (but, sadly and unsurprisingly, ignored by most of them) is that over 50% of sales are driven by direct-link publisher marketing efforts, rather than browsing.   That is site-wide....so that means, by law of averages, that the average includes publishers who don't do ANY direct-link marketing.   For publishers like Adamant, the overwhelming majority of our sales are driven by our own marketing, not browsing -- so we're not worried about getting "lost in the shuffle" against anyone else, since most of our sales are coming from customers following specific links to our products.</blockquote>
I've seen this said by RPGNOW people a number of times but my opinion hasn't really changed. If I'm having to tell people about my book and where to buy it (which of course I am) then why would I ever send them to RPGNOW over my own site, where I make more money? Wheres the benefit in that?                        </div>

No, it's not.  Phil stumbled upon a test site, which was intended to show e23 what could be done, if they want to join in.  It was not intended to be public.   No deal has been struck.

Because people are more likely to purchase from an established eTailer than a company site -- due to security and privacy concerns, as well as the fact that it allows them to purchase more than just YOUR product in a single check-out.  Convenience factor plays a large part in purchasing.                        </div>

Completely true. However, last year when Travis Brown and I voiced disapointment to RPGNOW about having our game buried on the Edge where it was very difficult to find we were told in no uncertain terms that it was not RPGNOWs job to promote our book. If we wanted to see sales we had to promote our own book and drive customer too RPGNOW. Thing is, we were already promoting our book and seeing nice sales off our site. Why drive those sales to RPGNOW? I have the same concern now with my currnt game Panty Explosion. I see nice sales on my own site. I do offer the game through other sites because I believe that the more places I can offer it the more people it will reach. And I understand that some of my customers preffer to buy through other sites for exactly the reasons you mention. I will add the PPGNOW logo to my webpage under places that offer the game, but I don't see the benefit of driving customers there when they seem perfectly happy to buy the game from me.<br/>
<br/>
Of course its a good idea to have your product in as many shops as possible, but if people are lining up at your shop to buy your product, why send them to the shop down the street?                        </div>
