It's about travelling through time to visit historical eras. I've made some simple rules for time travel, designed to give a feel of "we can do lots of cool stuff!" while avoiding all sorts of paradoxes and other trouble for the novice GM.<br/><br/>Trying to construct a foolproof system is foolish, of course; and pitting my mind against that of hundreds of minmaxing young role-players is a battle I'm bound to lose. So... please hack my rules so I know what holes to fix!<br/><br/>Here are the bare bones:<br/><br/>- You're sent on missions by an Organization. They control the time machine; you only go where they send you.<br/>- You go as an avatar - a copy of yourself which interacts with history. If the avatar dies, you're fired (new character).<br/>- Your job is to preserve history. Doing otherwise causes ruptures in time, which makes you lose certain skills &amp; powers.<br/>- Your powers are cool, but limited: Slow time to make an extra attack; look into the past in the location you're in; erase &amp; rewind to redo one or two rounds of action.<br/><br/>How can this setup be abused by inventive players?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf" title="Bailywolf"><img alt="Bailywolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bailywolf">Bailywolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110222/#Comment_110222" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T05:08:48+00:00" title="November 29, 2007  5:08AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, someone could always break history by creating a Hitler-shaped hole in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBaring that eternal problem, I don't see much issue with it.

Combination locks, for instance, won't hinder them. Unless you have some kind of rules for boredom setting in.<br/>It will also make it easy to short-circuit plots that rely on being sure of your facts before taking action. Example:<br/>GM: One of these Founding Fathers has been replaced by a robot! But you can't tell which one!<br/>Player: I shoot Ben Franklin in the head. Are there sparks?<br/>GM: Um, no. He's dead.<br/>Player: Okay, rewind. Now I shoot George Mason in the head.<br/>(etc.)<br/><br/>Part of this depends on whether everybody else remembers the erased period of time, and how they see it. Ben Franklin might be pissed if you shot him in the head, even if he magically gets better ten seconds later. Also, if you can't erase/rewind the same block more than once (or maybe once per player), you lessen the problem.<br/><br/>If causing a time rupture results in lowering your skills and abilities, then you have a sort of death cycle, where when things get more messed up your ability to fix the problem goes down as well. It seems like for racheting plot purposes you might want the opposite, but maybe with some permanent cost or something.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how the avatar thing helps you. From a player point of view, if they screw up and die they still have to roll up a new character. From the character point of view, I can see that there would be a difference, and people might be more willing to do heroic self-sacrifices. Maybe that's what you're going for. As an alternative, you could do a Paranoia-style thing, where you can have up to six avatars before the imprinting machine won't work on you any more or something. Maybe each successive one is a little more removed from the original, letting you tweak the stats in some way. This would probably lead to more gonzo play, which might be good for a teenage audience.<br/><br/>One other thing: the Rewind ability is going to be a pain for a GM to run in a complicated combat, which goes against your target of wanting this to work for novice GMs. Imagine five players all taking their actions, doing damage, ruining the scenery, taking wounds. Then the sixth player flubs his attack, and decides to Rewind the scene by a round. Now you have to go back and figure out where everything was one round ago, reset all of the numbers, get rid of damage taken, etc. That could potentially be a lot of tricky bookkeeping. Maybe you could make it easier if a person has to set down an "anchor" first, and then they have the ability to rewind to that anchor. That way you just write down all of the relevant numbers when they anchor, and you can rollback to that. This sort of mechanic will probably be familiar to any of your players who have played a video game with a save/restore function.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110372/#Comment_110372" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-29T11:55:04+00:00" title="November 29, 2007 11:55AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps the rewind ability could instead be the rationale for a substantial bonus on rolls that benefit from repeated tries (i.e. most of them).

A character, while time traveled a few years into the past, walks into a Starbucks and orders a cup of coffee.  Does this change history or not?  Seems like it's an arbitrary GM call (and likewise, any event is such) unless you have a clear idea of how history actually happened and what characters have to do to change it.  Unless *everything* the characters do in another time causes changes (which sounds like a nightmare), you'll need to figure out when a change is substantial and when it isn't.  This is why the "Information is All" clause exists in continuum, so you can ignore "changes" that cause no contradictions for the characters.  You can go to Starbucks because, according to history, you do go to Starbucks; you're fulfilling history instead of changing it.  But it sounds like you're focusing on changes to big-H recorded History (like in history books).  Still, knowing when changes matter is probably going to be important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_110600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110600/#Comment_110600" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T07:25:43+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  7:25AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh,  I see what you mean.<br/><br/>Well, this game is, as you say, focused on history book History. It's an educational tool, and the whole framing story is an excuse to let players role-play in lots of different periods of history. The game is about the Grand Events that Shaped Our World etc - the scenario I'm currently writing is about the origins of democracy, for example. Which means that if the players, I don't know, kill some farmer's cow because they're starving, it won't affect things - but if they convince Plato to re-write his dialogues, it will.<br/><br/>Most of this will be handled very explicitly in the scenarios, at least to begin with - "You see the bad guys trying to convince Nebuchadnezzar to do something ahistorical!

You could handwave some of the difficulties of impersonation by positing a Quantum Leap-style thing, where the PCs jump into and possess historical figures who are about to do something 'wrong'. <br/><br/>As far as what changes are big enough to screw things up, you could write the module to make it really explicit. So in this scenario, as long as Abe dies and John Wilkes Booth never makes it to trial, then history will work itself out. And the players can know this going into the scenario - these are the things you can't compromise on. If the bad guys keep Abe from going to the theater, then the players can scheme to drop a piano on him, and they would still win. Anything outside of the scenario points is just color - the future might be different in fun ways when you go back, but history will essentially be unchanged.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110761/#Comment_110761" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T14:16:16+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  2:16PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2007 2:17PM by Chris_Goodwin.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>Heck -- if their job isn't to screw up history, I'd simply posit, so long as history is broken, you *can't* get back -- the ticket's one way.

Part of the (mechanical or narrative) crunch comes from vying to occupy the necessary minds while the Opposition is trying to also occupy them and break history? You could have this whole scene setup process, where there's a battle for initial control of the relevant minds, followed by continuing tests to retain control (perhaps at times of high physical or emotional stress?). Then, the game is less about "weird history which must be untangled while avoiding paradox" and more of a "strategizing about when and where to focus efforts on control."<br><br>Ex: The Opposition wants Kennedy to live, so they occupy Oswald as a child and walk him in front of a train; the Organization then sends in an agent to (a) resist that initial "suicide" and then (b) keep Oswald (mostly) on-track to Dallas and the book repository. But... just to be sure... they ALSO send an agent or two to occupy some others as a "guarantee"... say, that cop on the grassy knoll and the secret service agent overwatching the street from another building. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br><br/>I <i>love</i> alt-history gaming!<br/>David                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_112021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

I mean, what's "breaking" it, anyway? "Winning too fast?" "Lameness" in actual play events? One player playing "Super Time Terror!!!" while the others are playing "Time Philosophers"?<br/><br/>If you want the game to help teach history, say, then who cares if they break it? Hmm... or rather, put in rules and mechanics which require those who break history to then extrapolate what other significant events would shift or never happen. Or use that for knock-on time travel events: where and how could you "push" time "back onto track," if at all? If nothing else, the players will really have to dig into causality in history to find a good leverage point to "fix" it, and they just might learn something before it's done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
