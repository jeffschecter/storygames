Hopefully we'll come up with some questions about solo play and fiction for later.<br/><br/>Does this make sense?<br/><br/>Eero and Tony anything else need to be added?<br/><br/>If not, go play and post here!!!

Well, if he was going to prove himself, he\u2019d have to start somewhere.<br/><br/>Climbing down the pit seems like a conflict with a danger of falling. I\u2019ll roll daring, since it seems to be the most important. Additionally, there\u2019re spiders halfway down, so I\u2019ll add another conflict- sneakiness vs. the spiders alertness (I\u2019ll say it\u2019s +3 since the spiders are lying in wait for a meal). <br/><br/>OK, so the first danger was averted, but it looks like the spiders spotted Zivon as he got near the bottom. I\u2019ll give the spiders the entangle ability and a heavy weapon (since their mouths are rather large). The spiders get the drop on zivon with the initiative, and manage to surprise him, landing a bite for two damage. Ouch! Zivon is pretty freaked out, so he\u2019ll try and run away- and manages to get past the webs and onto the ground floor. The spiders attempt another attack, but they only mange to snare his cloak, ripping at the end, but not actually hurting him any worse. <br/><br/>Rushing into the next room to escape from the spiders, Zivon enters the next room, B: The orc den (created by my brother).<br/>This room contains 17 orcs, 12 of which are drunkenly celebrating, and three of which are asleep. The other two stand watch over by the entrance to area C. Zivon\u2019s hurried running gets him noticed by some of the drunk orcs. Zivon decides to try and talk his way out of the situation. The orcs are mean and drunk, so I\u2019ll give them a +4 to stubbornness, tough odds against Zivon\u2019s +0 eloquence.<br/><br/> And it turns out that Zivon\u2019s half hearted speech about having to deliver something to the back part of the cave fails to impress the orcs, as five of them begin to attack. Zivon manages to act first, a chance he uses to get the drop on the orcs and slash in with his knife, killing one of them before it gets a chance to even pick up its weapons. The other four orcs that have decided to fight rush at Zivon and try to pummel him with their fists and broken bottles, smashing broken glass into him. Zivon counters by stabbing one in the chest and killing it, followed by promptly spinning around and decapitating one with a knife swing. The two remaining try and counter attack, but end up getting taken out by Zivon\u2019s dagger. <br/><br/>Zivon stands triumphant, before realizing that the rest of the orcs did, in fact, notice him and rush him en masse. They manage to pummel Zivon, and he counters by killing two of them, but then they finally overwhelm and take him down. Zivon\u2019s last thoughts before going down are \u201c\u2026I should have brought a healer..."<br/><br/>Well that was a fun little exercise. I think <a href="http://redboxhack.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">red box hack</a> was a good choice, but if you choose it you might want to either try and talk through challenges or start at a higher level, since I think a lot of these games are designed for party combat. <br/><br/>I didn't really approach the challenges in any particular way, and maybe if I'd have challenged the orcs to a drinking contest or something I wouldn't have died- but I just couldn't see my warrior doing anything but fighting. As far as comments about making engaging fiction goes, my comment is going to be that putting in a large group of orcs makes engaging the fiction difficult. When combat's involved it can sometimes put a stop to things other than just hacking- which doesn't always work, as above. <br/><br/>I also learned that I really like the rules for red box hack. I'll have to run a game using that for my group sometime.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190741/#Comment_190741" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-31T15:48:29+00:00" title="January 31, 2009  3:48PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.
