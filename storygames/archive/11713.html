RPGs are not real life, and for the most part, they don't try to emulate it. They are closer to literature, theatre and film. Violence in art is dramatic, shocking, cathartic, meaningful or (gasp) fun. Real life is not really like Rambo or Die Hard either. Or Richard the 3rd or Macbeth for that matter. Then again, the world is an extremely violent place, we just overlook it most of the time. There has not been a day of complete peace since WW2 which means, somewere, people are killing each other right now.<br/><br/>2. RPGs share their ancestry with wargaming. The ancestry is obvious, especially in more oldschool games, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Not much to discuss here.<br/><br/>3. In many "contemporary" RPGs, violence is far from easy or it at least brings up many questions and shows us the consequences of violence. Some games put violence last. Dogs. MLwM. Doctor Who.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine" title="Daniel Levine"><img alt="Daniel Levine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Levine">Daniel Levine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261207/#Comment_261207" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T10:16:38+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 10:16AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan H.</cite><br/>I've never shot anyone, but I'm sure it's much harder to do then is done in rpgs.<br/>Why's it so easy?<br/></blockquote>\nSlightly tangential, but one of the things I like about Unsung (which I know I end up shilling for a lot) is that shooting someone isn't a Guns roll, or a Precision roll, or anything like that - it's a Guts roll.  The "hard" part is working up the nerve to kill another human being.  It turns out, at least with reliable weapons, that may be a big part of what's hard about it in real life - see, e.g., Grossman's _On Killing_.<br/><br/>In addition to JDCorley's point, though, I think that it may have something to do with the fact that most of us *don't* use a lot of violence in real life... but, you know, the thanatos impulse is always there and especially in our (my, at least) culture the message that violence solves things is reinforced heavily.  So it's tempting to play with.  So maybe that's part of why so many games revolve around violence.<br/><br/>As for why violence is maybe relatively easy to implement, technically?  Maybe what's attractive about toying with violence is toying with its outcomes, not about trying to figure out if I could shoot a pistol straight if I put my mind to it.  Heck, that I *can* learn to do if I really wanted to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261208/#Comment_261208" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T10:17:44+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 10:17AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our games are set up with different consequences for violent behavior than we'd experience in the real world.

It's the 'Fallout' that's hard - broken bones and broken lives. Working up the nerve can be hard for some, but for others it's keeping control when they're upset. I find that some people are just looking for a reason to get violent and self-righteous, whereas others wouldn't know what to do with their first, or a knife, or a gun, to save their life. Psychologically speaking, violence always destroys people internally. <br/><br/>The disconnect in most games is twofold: one, that there's necessarily no narrative consequences - i.e. being arrested and tried for assault/murder/carrying a concealed weapon/etc. In most 'modern' setting games this would be pretty boring and not address the premise of the game. Not mention the sort of people that the character would have to be and become to commit these crimes with an regularity. Two is that most 'combat' mechanics are to real violence what chess is to medieval warfare. Because the mechanics are predictable and abstract, they conceal the fact that almost all violence incidences in reality are ambiguous, quick and messy events that are largely beyond anyone's control, or are horrifyingly asymmetric. <br/><br/>For many players and game designers, representing these realities isn't interesting to them. Vincent Baker includes them in his games to some degree. I agree with Adam in the sense that often our characters are toys or experiments and we play with them accordingly. I find the Hit Point style of design (even with dice modifiers) is incredibility tedious; some sort of narrative condition is far more interesting to me as a player and better represents the 'reality' of reality.<br/><br/>At any rate, interesting topic!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261315/#Comment_261315" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T13:30:44+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  1:30PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my opinion, violence is present in RPGs for a couple reasons:<br/>1) Violence is a side-effect of action, which is fun.<br/>2) People in RPGs tend to have highly conflicting views, and one way to solve (to a certain definition of "solve" anyways) any dispute is through violence<br/>3) Letting proper authorities take care of things and resolving disputes through reason and compromise is often boring and/or difficult. Many RPGs carry few penalties for violence, and thus it becomes a preferable method of handling things, especially when you consider than in many RPGs the players a pre-disposed to win violent conflicts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261319/#Comment_261319" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T13:38:53+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  1:38PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan Wilson</cite>The disconnect in most games is twofold: one, that there's necessarily no narrative consequences - i.e. being arrested and tried for assault/murder/carrying a concealed weapon/etc. In most 'modern' setting games this would be pretty boring and not address the premise of the game.

Same reason that kids' games often involve play-violence.<br/><br/>Also, physical conflict is by far the easiest kind to simulate in a game. Various RPGs have rules for mental/social/emotional conflict (like BW's 'Duel of Wits') but they tend to be unsatisfying because nonphysical damage is harder to put metrics on than physical damage, and because the nonphysical aspects are the things that _aren't_ being simulated in the game: if a PC and an NPC argue, they're using real words that are being interpreted by real minds. That tends to make the conflict rules feel arbitrary and controlling, since the simulated result might not match what happened IRL. This doesn't come up with physical combat because you're not really fighting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261352/#Comment_261352" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T16:25:47+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  4:25PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

I don't know if I'll be able to add thoughts of substance when several others have already done such a nice job of making valid points. But since I'm quickly being tagged as "the violence guy," I feel compelled to say <i>something</i>.<br/><br/>I tend toward the camp of thinkers here that see what we do in roleplay as a way to play what we fear.  For most of us (the sane ones), being subject to violence is an extremely scary thought.  As Fred Rogers said, we can practice our feelings in a safe way through play, though I'm sure he wouldn't have approved of the level of violence in the average roleplaying session, let alone campaign.<br/><br/>I'm also of the mind that we game to do things we wouldn't dare do in real life, and fear plays into that, as well.  We don't punch the people we disagree with because we might: 1) get arrested, or 2) get pummeled in return.  Imagined violence on imagined enemies allows a freedom of action and freedom from fear that almost can't help but be somewhat extreme.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261457/#Comment_261457" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-11T12:08:50+00:00" title="March 11, 2010 12:08PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            just a comment about people being peace loving, and just generally wanting to live their lifes in peace.<br/><br/>That is very true, <br/><br/>that said, those same people will sometimes go and hang niggers <br/><br/>violence and peacing loving are surprisingly compatible                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261471/#Comment_261471" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-11T13:24:44+00:00" title="March 11, 2010  1:24PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite>that said, those same people will sometimes go and hang niggers</blockquote>\nNot in ordinary circumstances, I hope.

Situations of mass participation, like the Rwandan genocide, are distinctive because of their rarity.  However, people in many situations seem to be surprisingly willing to acquiesce in, support, and condone violence despite being "peaceful" themselves - they may even use the violence of those directly involved as a tool to pursue personal ends, even though they will not kill directly.  (If anyone is seriously interested in this, the book to read is Stathis Kalyvas' _The Logic of Violence in Civil Wars_... or if you want more narrative about how people who are otherwise "normal" get caught up in mass violence, check out _Machete Season: The Killers in Rwanda Speak_).  The "difficullty" of using violence for most people seems at least as much about psychological barriers as deterrence or moral objection.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261621/#Comment_261621" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T08:42:41+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  8:42AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Serbia<br/>South Africa<br/>Rwanda<br/>Nazi Germany<br/>Sri Lanka<br/>The Injuns<br/>The Ukrainian Famine<br/><br/>This is a list of the last 100 years and only really the more impressive ones, I think it would be silly to say that everyone involved in these are in 'exceptional circumstances' and a 'distinct minority' especially when you consider supporters/collaberators.

And I use "wonder if" to mean "pretty sure"...<br/><br/>Mainly, this example: A roleplaying game from Japan called <a href="http://www.bouken.jp/product/satasupe/" rel="nofollow"><b>SATASUPE</b></a> ("<b>Sat</b>urday Night <b>Spe</b>cial"). It is a self-proclaimed "Asian Punk RPG", and the game has rules for basically just four things: Guns, Fucking, Chases and Drugs. <br/><br/>Now the thing is, drugs doesn't get a little ruleset like "if you do this drug, you get these bonuses for x hours", it goes off into a whole sub-ruleset involving character powers, backgrounds and cinematic advantages and disadvantages to being involved in the drug culture.<br/><br/>Thing is, drugs are pretty taboo in Japan: You can probably talk to 5 random people in the US and find out that 2-3 of them had tried pot (depending on where you lived, yadda yadda); but in Japan it's very rare. Also, all illegal drugs are lumped into class-A felonies: So having a kilo of marijuana is the same as having a kilo of heroin in Japanese law. If a movie or TV star is caught taking drugs (and they rarely say the drug involved in the news, just "drugs!"; could have been uppers, crystal meth, weed, etc), they're <b>done</b>.<br/><br/>It seems that this game, with it's huge cinematic take on drugs (along with typical violent action, chases and romance) could only have come from Japan: It's not as big of a "real problem" in Japan, and thus easier to fantasize about it?<br/><br/>Some thoughts.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261860/#Comment_261860" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-13T19:53:01+00:00" title="March 13, 2010  7:53PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jackson tegu</cite>(<a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a>, i don't think the hobby is still treading water because of its roots a few decades ago in table-top wargaming.<br/>oh, and p.s.

But if you look at party games, there are a lot that involve sexual undertones (or at least touching) in some manner. Especially the ones played in the same age demographics of most rpgs players (I played "spin the bottle" much before any rpg, for example...)  <br/><br/>And it could be said that, like in sports, the violence in RPGS is often only sublimated sex (entire books could be written about the Freudian symbolism of entering dark caves, foll of unknown and dangerous perils, armed with long straight weapons...) <br/><br/>Maybe it's the social environment: party games are often played in a very social and secure environment, between friends. RPGs, by the other hand, are often played with people who meet only for play rpgs or that did meet only to play rpgs, in an environment much less secure, socially.<br/><br/>[edit: and the percentage on women playing make a lot of difference, obviously]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261997/#Comment_261997" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-15T07:39:13+00:00" title="March 15, 2010  7:39AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It depends on the game.

But violence can be a form of power over others, and, as we know from Dogs in the Vineyard, when you have that kind of power--to get what you want through the application of violence--it's hard not to give in to temptation. Because, after all, surely your ideas about what's right are better than those of others. And a little bit of violence to make everyone else's lives more just and good can't possibly be misplaced. <br/><br/>In other words, it can be hard sometimes not to be a bully, especially if and when you're convinced you're right. Look at how more powerful nations in today's world apply military force to "police" other states, for instance. <br/><br/>I posted that little comment above because I found it interesting that there's thread about violence and why it happens, but no mention of violence as a form power over others.

Both things that we don't get involved in very often. I don't find adventuring in a modern day world to be much fun - I know what it's like, it's too much like real life. In a made up fantasy world, with magic, on the other hand, it's something completely foreign. Same goes for a sci-fi game that involves traveling the stars - it's something that isn't part of my life, so the make believe aspect is also strong. It also helps that violence is something most people don't know much about. I always run into this with grappling rules in RPGs. It's something I do, so I always find problems, and always need to fix it. Most other people don't notice it's a problem. If something comes up involving swords or guns, I'm not going to give it a huge deal of thought, while a sharpshooter might be quite annoyed. This also ties in somewhat to where there are heavy mechanics and where there are none. If it's expected most people know it, like negotiation and social interaction, there isn't a complex subsystem, it's just a roll to see what happens, or skip the roll entirely. If you don't know how it works really, you let the mechanics decide it for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
