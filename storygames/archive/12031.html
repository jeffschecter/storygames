I read AW what seems like forever ago and am excited to finally get to play.  (Christian is running for us)<br/><br/>One of the players, David, is considering a Savvyhead.  I hadn't looked over this character type carefully because it didn't appeal to me at first glance.  It still doesn't, but one of their potential Moves is as follows:<br/><br/><i><b>Oftener right</b>: when a character comes to you for advice, tell<br/>them what you honestly think the best course is. If they do it,<br/>they take +1 to any rolls they make in the doing, and you mark<br/>an experience circle.</i><br/><br/>This strikes me a really clever piece of design.  It's a buff, a Key, and in the hands of David and any other player likely to choose it, full of (frightening) potential to drive the kind of story that player wants to see, as well as the kind of play the player with the character <i>taking</i> the advice wants to see.<br/><br/>Win. Made literally from Win/Win.<br/><br/>There are other cool PC powers like this in AW.  Very explicit powers with clear intents.  And the players get to choose them from a menu of options.  I really like games that do this.  I'd like to see other examples from games you like that you think do this kind of thing particularly well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269237/#Comment_269237" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-27T18:54:59+00:00" title="April 27, 2010  6:54PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>I hadn't looked over this character type carefully because it didn't appeal to me at first glance.

If you put stones in your Leadership action (stones were the resource allocation that basically emphasized "what you did"), then other members of the team could take from a pool of that many extra stones if and only if they were following your plan. It was very cool - suggestive without being coercive.<br><br>The role of powerz in stories is interesting.  I think the new Dresden Files RPG takes this to a level that I haven't seen before.  Basically, everyone starts with a level of "refresh", a number that represents how many Fate chips you get at the start of a story.  Then as you gain powerz (including "mortal stunts", which are little mini-powerz that even non-supernaturals can have), you deduct from your refresh level.  Player characters must have a refresh of at least 1 - that represents the lowest level at which you are not a slave to your godlike abilities.  This reflects the "give up free will for powers" theme in the source material, as well as in many other folkloric/horrific stories.  The bad guy gains major power but loses himself in the process.  That's pretty great.<br><br>A much looser version was in White Wolf's Aberrant, their superhero game in which as the player characters gained more and more power, their Taint level and thus their insanity and megalomania would also increase.  This was somewhat undermined by how hard it was to increase your powers.  In other words, there really was never much choice about it unless and until you were playing your character for a really long time, much longer than I think most Aberrant campaigns went.<br/><br/>I also remember a Usenet conversation I had with one of the Trinity developers when I was comparing the use of psi powers in that game to those squishy-soft 1970s science fiction books where the protagonist has psychic powers not because it's relevant to the story, but because "in the future, we will all be psychic", and he said that he got his inspiration for the psychic powers more from detective stories, especially at low levels - reading surface thoughts, being a master of disguise, etc. are all things that detectives do in mundane ways, and being able to do them "magically" is an interesting addition to a game where solving mysteries is a big way of running it.<br/><br/>I should also note that the type of power matters.  If I say "the power is magic", my wife will hate it.  If I say "the power is psychic", she will like it, even if the setting and story it's in is otherwise identical.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269592/#Comment_269592" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-30T16:45:53+00:00" title="April 30, 2010  4:45PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Many, many items from the Exalted boxed set <i>Dreams of the First Age</i> are on the level of a plot device.
