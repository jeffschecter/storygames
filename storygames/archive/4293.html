So the first thing I'd do is calculate the percentage chance in a number of situations. I've seen quite a few games (most recently JAGS-2) that get horribly slaughtered by mechanics that stop working so well when you look at them closer. <br><br>I also kicked around the idea of a system that went from 1d12 for absolute beginner down to 1d1 for absolute master. It was based around everyone succeeding, you just roll to see when you succeed, so the lower the roll the faster you succeed, and the smaller the die the more likely you are to have lower rolls. Cool idea, the problem was that from 1d1 to 1d2 there's a 50% drop on suceeding on your first try. That just didn't jive particularly well.<br><br>In retrospect I could just have the top ability be 1d2 and the odds would look better, but it illustrates that you can run into some problems with variable dice that aren't obvious on a first glance.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dogui" title="Dogui"><img alt="Dogui" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dogui">Dogui</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96715/#Comment_96715" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T20:41:12+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  8:41PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The game I made for Game Chef 07 (Silent Archaea) also rated attributes with different dice.<br>\n<br>\nCheers!                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96741/#Comment_96741" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T22:28:08+00:00" title="September 16, 2007 10:28PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I came up with an <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1564" rel="nofollow">Underdog dice system</a> that used different die sizes, but I've never developed it.

How do you like this mechanic compared to games with a unified die mechanic, like d20?</br></blockquote>\nHello Stuart! <br/><br/>There are many RPGs featuring multi-die mechanics, as others have said. To answer your question, I don't personally like them much, as I often feel like the designers "squeezed" the scale based on the existing polyhedrals. But that's just one guy's opinion.<br/><br/>Forgive me but I have to share this with you and hope you won't take offense. <br/><br/>I'm a tiny bit worried that you didn't know there were indeed such mechanics. They've been there for a long, long time. This might mean you've been incredibly unlucky and never stumbled upon one, or it might mean you've not been exposed to many games yet. May I suggest visiting RPG.net and reading lots of reviews? Trust me, it's a good start and will expose you to many games, if only as core concepts. There's also John Kim's list of free RPGs, where you will see all sorts of RPGs in full details, from robust games to lite, from trad to avant-garde. Hanging out on the various forums (RPG.net, RPGsite, The Forge and of course Story Games) will also point you to all sorts of commercial games as well. <br/><br/>What worries me even more is the fact you were not going to talk about your mechanics until close to launch "because you thought they were novel". That's usually a sign (for me) of a game that will be bland and ultimately disappointing. I mean, even if we assume the core mechanic <i>had </i>been novel, what exactly did you think would happen should you describe it? <br/><br/>Trust me on this, Stuart. Every day, the various authors and designers are breaking new ground and sharing it... which provides them with feedback to further refine the concepts. The great games nowadays are often those who are designed completely in the open. Heck, more and more authors are actually giving part (or even all) of the game for free and still manage to sell a lot of copies. So the next time you have an idea you think is novel, put it out in the open with a great community like this one (or another) and you might just do yourself and your game a favor, not to mention attract a customer base in the process.<br/><br/>Hope you don't find the comments above insulting. They aren't meant to be. It's just that in 27 years of gaming, I have seen a lot of people claim to have super secret, super novel engines only to see them bust. <br/><br/>Nobody is going to steal your ideas. Your ideas don't mean much, like pretty much any ideas anyone might have. It's all going to be in the execution of those ideas.<br/><br/>Take care and best of luck with your game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stuart" title="Stuart"><img alt="Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stuart">Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97256/#Comment_97256" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T13:47:07+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  1:47PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know there are lots of RPGs that use more than one dice.

In Savage Worlds dice can "ace" meaning that if you roll the max value you can roll again and add the two dice together. Multiple times even. I liked how this turned out in play.

Sorry Stuart! <br/><br/>Well, in that case, I don't know many games that use the exact same mechanic. <b>The Window </b>uses dice to rate attributes but smaller=better and it's a roll under system. I started going to Board Game Geek last year and you are absolutely right. Great place!<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm rooting for a fellow Canadian here. I sure hope your company succeeds!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_97333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stuart" title="Stuart"><img alt="Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stuart">Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/97333/#Comment_97333" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-18T16:53:13+00:00" title="September 18, 2007  4:53PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No problem, and thanks! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>\n<br/>\nI'm really excited about the game -- hopefully people will dig it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
