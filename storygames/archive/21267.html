I'm spanish but i would like to have some comments of you, Story Games people! <br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kFxRLb_4WX2WOia9pf0U9FRgH_HJrWg7zSj1WLYKxQU/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kFxRLb_4WX2WOia9pf0U9FRgH_HJrWg7zSj1WLYKxQU/edit?usp=sharing</a><br/><br/>So, first of all, yes, mechanics are stolen from everywhere - Solar System for the way the rolls work, Burning Wheel for the Paths, even Mortal Coil for the Motivations. There's more: Traits are something reminiscent of Dogs in the Vineyard, and i'm sure in forgetting a lot of other parts that came from other games.<br/><br/>I will be really honest: I don't really think it exists the "novelty" as it is, i just wanted a game about an introspective journey grounded in the personal drama, and the adventure that comes out from that. <br/><br/>I dont really know if i hit the mark, or if the game had evolved to some other thing, completely.<br/><br/>Could you give me some tips, please? Perhaps commenting what do you think it aims, if it's aimed correctly or... i dont know, something? Right now i need people reading it from the designer's coach.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/paganini" title="paganini"><img alt="paganini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/paganini">paganini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465948/#Comment_465948" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-27T16:30:32+00:00" title="August 27, 2017  4:30PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looks like you've been doing your homework! I see lots of Sorcerer in here. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>So, I'm curious about what it is that makes this game special, in your eyes. What I mean is, why not just play Solar System, or Sorcerer? Was there some particular itch you got while playing Dogs in the Vineyard that made you go "dang, I need to make my own game" to scratch it?<br/><br/>One terminology / technical comment:<br/><br/>I don't think your traits are what make a character a protagonist. Your example traits are just things the character can do, or background life roles. Everyone has those, even supporting characters. <br/><br/>What makes a character a protagonist is whatever it is about that character that makes him different. Sometimes that's something that makes him stand out in a good way: he's extra skilled, or extra kind, or whatever. But just as easily it's something like he's extra stubborn or extra greedy or something like that. A typical story of this kind starts out showing us why stubbornness is bad, then being stubborn gets our hero out of trouble, so we think "hey, maybe stubbornness is OK after all," and then as things wind down we realize that stubbornness doesn't go into categories of good or bad, it's just part of who the character is. <br/><br/>Another important idea here is that traits can load a character with inner tension - such as loyalty to a friend vs. personal ambition - that you (or the GM) can use to create situations that put pressure on the character. <br/><br/>So, it seems like you want conflict resolution, but your examples give the impression of traditional task-type play. <br/><br/>- N<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Edgargso" title="Edgargso"><img alt="Edgargso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Edgargso">Edgargso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465950/#Comment_465950" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-27T18:15:42+00:00" title="August 27, 2017  6:15PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When i was designing this game, i first thought "I really want a game where the forefront of the characters are their emotions and ideals, and that emotions/ideals build the story we will tell as a group."<br/><br/>I wanted a game grounded in the internal world of the characters, not on the external world of the game. I wanted a game, not only of drama, but a game of grey scales. I wanted that situation where a iron-willed character who does'nt know how to really fight, manages to hit out of rage a cold-blooded asassin trying to kill his sister. Maybe he won't kill this assasin, but it will be the first cornerstone of what he will become in the future, out of sheer love for her sister.<br/><br/>I want that situation where her sister is laying on the ground, unconscious, and there's a whole building being reduced to ashes, and our Protagonist has to choose between two of his driving principles: The life of her sister, or the life of thousands of innocent civilians. <br/><br/>I wanted that situation where fighting for his goals, the character dives deep into darkness only to bring a little bit of light, and the things that teases him in the dark. I wanted the dark character trying to achieve vengeance and being teased with pure love, having the chance to refuse all his life of vengeance and live happily. I want that choices. And i want that we explore them deeply. From the inside of each character.<br/><br/>I wanted that kind of situations to be the forefront of the game. We are embarked on a mission, yes, but that's not the important thing. What is important is that we will be faced with our own desires, emotions, feelings and duties in our journey.<br/><br/>No game gave me that. Not sorcerer, not Burning Wheel (maybe the closest), not Mortal Coil, not Dogs in the Vineyard.<br/><br/>Aaand i dont know if i explained something or i said nothing XD                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/paganini" title="paganini"><img alt="paganini" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/paganini">paganini</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465956/#Comment_465956" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-27T23:24:41+00:00" title="August 27, 2017 11:24PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds like you want The Shadow of Yesterday.

But "punchy" it isn't, I'm sorry. You'll have to go on some other selling point - perhaps "masterfully crafted", "fine tuned" or "deep". Or just go around demonstrating the game and make a name for it.

I think a major thing missing to make it truly stick is an equally catchy "how".  Not a detailed description of the rules themselves, but a quick hint at what happens when you engage them.<br/><br/>"Characters are defined by Drives, deeply-held values that inform their actions.  When urged on by their Drives, characters can accomplish surprising feats, feats which will change them.  A peaceful character urged to violence by their love for their mother may overcome a trained killer, but also gain a violent Trait.<br/><br/>In play, the GM's job is to pit each characters' drives against each other, forcing them to choose what they'll uphold and what they'll sacrifice."<br/><br/>("Drives" may be catchier than "Motivations".)<br/><br/>Now give it a name that sounds like that -- maybe something like "Dilemma" -- and I think I'd remember it!<br/><br/>I'd probably remember it more if it had a memorable default setting, though.<br/><br/>The next thing I'd want to see before playing it is a play report or two that honestly shares what it's like to play out moral dilemma after moral dilemma.  Because if it's just an adventure game with a side of moral dilemmas, then I don't see how that's different than e.g. Dogs in the Vineyard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Edgargso" title="Edgargso"><img alt="Edgargso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Edgargso">Edgargso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466138/#Comment_466138" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-08T08:30:51+00:00" title="September  8, 2017  8:30AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey!
