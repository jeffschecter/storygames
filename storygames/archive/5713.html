It's going to be my first trip to GenCon this year, and I'm very confused by, well, America in general.</p>\n<p>Specifically, I'm really befuddled by how hard it is to travel by rail in your nation.</p>\n<p>So, I'm coming from Ottawa, ON, which is close to Watertown, NY (well, really, Ogdensburg, NY).  I really, really like rail travel.  Is it even possible to get to Indianapolis by rail?  Are there multiple rail companies in the US?</p>\n<p>Has anyone else here on done a rail trip to GenCon before?  I'd love to hear about it.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br/>\nDarcy</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127695/#Comment_127695" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T12:40:46+00:00" title="February 19, 2008 12:40PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sure Watertown is too small for a station. But Amtrak does serve parts of Canada.  But I'm getting ahead.<br/><br/>Your only choice is pretty much Amtrack. I don't think there is any other passenger rail option. Rail travel is so unpopular and expensive that, except for certain regional systems, Amtrak is your only choice, and it's subsidized by the government (and almost all the regional systems are basically very large public transportation) to prevent passenger rail from going completely bankrupt and obsolete.  It's slower and more expensive, so almost no one does it here. We fly or drive.  Since you enjoy it, and the dollar is weak anyway, that shouldn't stop you.<br/><br/>What you'll want to do is go to Amtrak's website (amtrak.com) and see if you're happy with travelling out of Montreal, or if there's anything on this side that's closer than Syracuse or Albany, and work out a travel itinerary or even order tickets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess" title="Darcy Burgess"><img alt="Darcy Burgess" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://home.ca.inter.net/~krunch/PBP/gc07/pics/icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darcy%20Burgess">Darcy Burgess</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127896/#Comment_127896" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T03:05:34+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  3:05AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hi Alvin,</p>\n<p>Thanks for the info.  I knew Amtrak was a passenger carrier in the US.  I didn't know that it was the only show in town.</p>\n<p>What saddens me is that there's a crappy 4-hour bus leg in their itinerary to Indianapolis.  And lay-overs that would make the angels weep.  One possibility includes leaving Syracuse at something like 8am on the 13th, and not arriving in Indy until 8:30pm on the 14th.  Holy fuck!</p>\n<p>I'm going to talk to a travel agent and see what they can do with their magic computers.<br/>\nD</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher" title="Marc_Majcher"><img alt="Marc_Majcher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marc_Majcher">Marc_Majcher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128098/#Comment_128098" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-20T13:34:20+00:00" title="February 20, 2008  1:34PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've traveled across the country on Amtrak before (literally, from San Francisco to New York and back), and it is simultaneously super fun and totally not fun. It really depends on how much you like trains, and the whole "train thing". It's still as expensive (if not more) than flying, and you really only want to do it if you don't particularly care when you arrive somewhere (or, in the winter, if you arrive at all). I still recommend it to people, but only to that particular kind of "train person". If you just look at it as a means of transportation, I'd say skip it; if you're in it for the experience of sitting on a train for a long time, and you're okay with that, then go for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
