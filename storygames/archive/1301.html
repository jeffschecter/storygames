                    Heya Gang,<br/><br/>So I pulled Mark Nau's character sheet, and as I mentioned in another thread I am inspired to do a Leprechauns in WWII game. It's been rather easy with only a few hiccups along the way to creation (to which I am grateful after seeing some of the sheets others got), and perhaps this ease is causing my problem I have now: Size.<br/><br/>As in, it's too easy to create for this, and so I'm at 20+ pages already, and can see it going farther. Is there a limit to these kinds of endeavors on page count? Additionally, I've been called out of town this weekend, so I won't have tonight, Saturday, or Sunday to work on it. Which means as it stands, even though I have a lot, it's not finished, and it might not get finished on time because of the scope I have set up already.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm getting at, and asking advice about, is how much is too much? For example: GM Advice &amp; Tips; Lots of fluff text about the game world; or sub-systems like adventure creation? Do you bother putting that in?<br/><br/>Thanks-<br/>-Brent                </div>

                            I'm going on the theory that having a clear picture of the game and playable mechanics is the thing to aim for, and after that comes lay-out, and after -that- comes the frilly touches like advice&amp;tips, etc. That way, I can stop when time is up, and submit a decent thing, instead of something pretty but unplayable as is. That doesn't mean don't work on the frills, just get the basics cooked first. Frex, in my mind, my game has a beautiful period map to roll on, and I have the graphic, but for this, I'm saying "Roll on a world map."                        </div>

                            I suggest making it playable -- even bare-bones playable -- first.  Then go in and fill in the details.                        </div>
