To quote from the website:\n<blockquote>In keeping with the spirit of the Indie Game Company Game Design Challenge, sales of the Thy Vernal Chieftains  pdf were suspended after midnight on January 31st. Thanks to all who supported it in the challenge. I'm hopeful of seeing some public feedback if you play the game.</blockquote>\nI'll have to defer to Paul for any further updates.

I forgot about that.  When I played, we just used sticky notes with the different elements written on them.  Worked fine for our purposes.
