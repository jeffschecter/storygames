A teen fantasy book (with Magnus Jakobsson), some erotic short stories (with another friend). <br/><br/>I think they're two different things (game design and writing, that is), but you can use skills from one in doing the other. <br/><br/>When writing the fantasy book, we weren't afraid to improvise and push the characters into impossible predicaments, because hey, we knew we could work something out. We're used to going out on a narrative limb. We also know a bit about how to make interesting characters, set up conflicts, etc.<br/><br/>When writing games, I sometimes use story arcs, specific prose techniques etc. I don't think I'm very good at writing flavour text, to be honest; I have pretty high standards for that sort of thing. I do it only when the game needs it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257793/#Comment_257793" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T06:00:51+00:00" title="February 23, 2010  6:00AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite>I've heard more than one game designer say that they write games because they are frustrated fiction writers.

They're two different skill sets for me, although I've met "game designers" who treat game design as an extension of writing craft; I don't consider them very good as game designers, usually, due to how they fail to account for the systemic aspects of game design.<br/><br/>The two activities do overlap in the practical writing and product management part, I've found. Making game books has been of great benefit in developing my writing discipline, analytic abilities and simple ability at seeing the whole project all at once and working towards clear waypoints. I suspect that I'm a bit more structural about my writing than most authors, partly due to game design experience. As Matthijs mentions, game experience does have some impact on plotting narratives in general, too: on my part I think that playing plenty of narrativistic roleplaying games has made me much more aware and capable of working with plot structurally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257814/#Comment_257814" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T07:19:17+00:00" title="February 23, 2010  7:19AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The characters I like to write about are all the ones that my players would never be interested for thirty seconds in playing, and maybe I agree with them, so there's little overlap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257815/#Comment_257815" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T07:21:01+00:00" title="February 23, 2010  7:21AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am a game designer and I do not write prose except for the tiny vignettes that sometimes support the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257852/#Comment_257852" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T09:14:59+00:00" title="February 23, 2010  9:14AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/final-hour-of-a-storied-age/" rel="nofollow">The game I'm working on</a> is my attempt to bring some of the ideas I use in fiction writing into game design.

Running games, making things up on the fly, is more like performance, it's creation and delivery in one without having to write things down. It's ephemerality and particpation are part of its charm and why it's not for a wider audience.<br/><br/>So I don't feel like a frustrated fiction writer because I'm in a continuous creative loop.
