The game is played in scenes, each one ending with a roll that determines whether the character in that scene gets what they want (in that scene). Let's say in one scene you get into a fight with someone--do you end up on your back, or still standing on both feet?<br/><br/>What I'm looking for is different ways of handling the character's progress towards a larger goal, given that scene-by-scene, one-roll-per-scene structure. Let's say you're trying to topple a local crime lord.<br/><br/>Can anyone either:<br/><br/>a) Suggest interesting ways to do this (or NOT to do this!), or<br/>b) Describe in loose terms how an existing game does this, and how it is cool or uncool?<br/><br/>The most obvious way to handle it would be:<br/><br/>"Name your story goal when you create the character. When you succeed in 5 scenes, you have reached your goal."<br/><br/>Here are my problems with that:<br/><br/>1) Not all story goals are created equal. Sometimes I'd like for these story goals to stretch out longer, if they are large in scope or just plain interesting to play out. It would be nice for this to be elastic in some way.<br/>2) Some scenes might not apply to the larger story goal. I don't necessarily want to cut those out of the game entirely.<br/>3) Ideally, it would still be possible to change your story goal in play, as the story develops.<br/><br/>So, any suggestions, or examples from existing designs? How might someone, or how *has* someone, handled gauging a character's progress towards a personal story goal within a larger story?<br/><br/>Good *questions* are also very welcome.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/><br/>Paul                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119575/#Comment_119575" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-14T23:41:07+00:00" title="January 14, 2008 11:41PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if this'll help, but I've been chewing on something similar with Know Thyself's scene/overall goal dynamic.  What I came up with overall was:<br/>The PC (in a single PC-multiple GM setup) has a goal, and will have a scene at the end to see if that goal is obtained.  In the mean time, they have a cycle between a couple short psychological scenes -- inside of a hallucination where they're wrestling control over their mind against their subconscious -- and revelation scenes about their past, informed by their success/failure in the psychological scenes.  This goes through a few cycles and then endgame is hit.  One class of memories disadvantages you and one class helps you in the final scene.<br/><br/>My goal was to have every scene have some meaning, so that there was no forgone conclusion halfway through the game in either direction.  So, however helpful that is, let me ask some questions.\n<blockquote>1) Not all story goals are created equal. Sometimes I'd like for these story goals to stretch out longer, if they are large in scope or just plain interesting to play out. It would be nice for this to be elastic in some way.</blockquote>\nDo you have a specific reason or particular idea for this, or is this a generic "I'd like my game to cover as many things as possible" element?  I see a lot of designs hang on the latter and break.  I know I have had that with my own, as I came from GURPS.\n<blockquote>2) Some scenes might not apply to the larger story goal. I don't necessarily want to cut those out of the game entirely.</blockquote>\nNot apply narratively or not apply mechanically?  You could divorce those ideas, if you like.  I highly recommend reading some of the highly scene-focused games, like My Life with Master or Burning Empires.\n<blockquote>3) Ideally, it would still be possible to change your story goal in play, as the story develops.</blockquote>\nAs in, "I achieved it/didn't achieve it, let's move on" or "I'm halfway two goal X, but now I want goal Y instead."  If your game is fiercely goal-oriented, I'm not sure you'll get a lot of the latter organically, but that'll depend on how the game works with a group of protagonists.<br/><br/>Now, let's go to your example of toppling a crime lord.  Is that in an of itself the entire goal, or do you break that up?  Without any other information, I wouldn't know where to proceed, but maybe I know something about this world, my character and know I could break it up.  Say I'm Billy Costigan from The Departed (2006):<br/>Sub-1:  Gain trust of Frank Costello<br/>Sub-2:  Inform without getting caught<br/>Sub-3:  Bust Costello (with assistance)<br/><br/>Now, sure, it didn't go that way.  (And it's been a year since I've seen the flick.)  But, that's one way I could break that up.  Now I know how to go about this Mounmental goal.<br/><br/>On the other hand, maybe I'm Batman and that's just the goal, period.  My scenes and about kicking ass, brutally interrogating and fighting a nemesis for justice.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is just one voice with one set of questions.  Take 'em as you will.  I could be totally misunderstanding what you're going for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119584/#Comment_119584" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-15T04:32:56+00:00" title="January 15, 2008  4:32AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>"Name your story goal when you create the character.

But at least the overall picture is independent of what happens in the individual scenes.<br/><br/>Beliefs in BW/BE may be personal goals that you can reach in your own time, within the greater story, and get payoff for during play.<br/><br/>I guess another version again would be Keys from TSOY, especially payoff of Keys?<br/><br/>Sorcerer's Kicker is pretty fluent. The story reaches its conclusion when the Kicker is resolved, which could be after 1 hour of play or 15 hours of play depending on the circumstances. Except Kicker is not a goal as of itself, more like an implied goal to react to the situation proposed: I want to resolve my Kicker. (And that works because the Kicker, and thus the goal, is authored by the player herself)<br/><br/>Per                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_119594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119594/#Comment_119594" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-15T05:45:53+00:00" title="January 15, 2008  5:45AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Timestream has a very mechanical structure for this. At character creation, you create a number of Goals for your character, each with a rating (1 to 6), and Obstacles to those Goals, also with a rating (-1 to -6). Obstacles are basically penalties for every roll that would move you closer to achieving your Goal. When you succeed at a roll that's moving towards your Goal, you have the opportunity to either lower your Goal (thus moving closer to achieving it), or reducing the obstacle penalty. Since these are options alongside a number of other options for improving your character, Goals tend to take longer then their simple numerical rating indicates, especially if they have large Obstacles. This is also a roll-by-roll basis, not a scene-by-scene basis, but it may be interesting to think about.<br/><br/>Darkpages also kinda works like this too, but it's still in playtest.<br/><br/>Oh! In InSpectres, you accumulate dice towards a preset number (based on rolling well), and when you hit the number, you've solved the scenario. So there's an example of a "group" goal-gaining mechanic which could get easily recast to individuals. Maybe each player states a goal for their character, and someone else/the GM (if there is one) sets their achievement number based on their description of how hard the goal is or how long it will take. Another feature of InSpectres is that this dice pool, once achieved, is also the experience that the group gets to use to advance their franchise before the next mission. Also a portable concept.<br/><br/>Hope that helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_119704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/119704/#Comment_119704" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-15T12:28:49+00:00" title="January 15, 2008 12:28PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If it seems unsatisfying to say "make up your goal, okay, when you succeed in 5 scenes, you have achieved the goal", reverse it.

That lets the player decide if this is a big scene, a little scene, or just a color scene. If you're working toward more than one goal, you could gamble a mix.<br/><br/>For example, you could have a scene where your character is trying to charm his way into joining a gang. You wager 2 points toward "Goal: Taking out the gang leader".

However, here are some comments and questions:<br/><br/>--Kickers in Sorcerer: I thought these were just situational. I mean, there's a situation you want to resolve, but there isn't anything mechanical going on in play that lets you gauge how close you are to resolving it. Is that right?<br/><br/>(Per, you brought it up--since you know what game I'm actually talking about, how is it different from Sorcerer? It sounds like pretty much the same thing to me. Please enlighten!)<br/><br/>--The suggestion to "make up the goal _afterwards_" is good, but can't work in the context I'm working on: play depends on the goals being known upfront.<br/><br/>Ryan:<br/><br/>1) Why do I want goals to be "elastic"? It may some "generic-appeal" thinking, as you point out--I'm not sure. My reasoning was more along the lines of, "I want someone with a large-scale, long-term goal to be able to play alongside someone with a very near-future, short-term goal."<br/><br/>2) I meant narratively. But I'd really like the narrative to align with the mechanics as much as possible in this case. What might be some advantages to divorcing them?<br/><br/>3) Both! But particularly the second version. I wouldn't want the mechanics to discourage people from doing that.<br/><br/>For everyone:<br/><br/>--Mechanics like Keys and (as far as I know) Beliefs let the player themselves decide when they have achieved their goals and can pick new ones. This doesn't help you gauge you how close you are to achieving the goal itself though, does it? It just encourages you to keep pursuing it.<br/><br/>Or am I missing something?<br/><br/>--Can anyone explain in more detail why you've suggested Burning Empires and Sign In Stranger as examples? I've never read or played those games...<br/><br/>Please keep it coming, folks! This is good stuff.

A neophyte's two cents here...<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom my understanding, things like keys will only help you gauge how close you are to something if there is a clear distinction between achievement and pursuit. If your goal is to destroy a certain artifact, for example, it's usually pretty clear when that goal has been achieved. If you want to destroy a set of artifacts and it's easy to know that you're X magic rings/staves/tomes/whatever short of your goal. If your goal is something less finite, however, it may turn into an eternal and pretty much unresolvable pursuit. If you want to be the most powerful being in the multiverse, how do you know when you get there? What's stopping someone or something from gaining enough power to overtake you?<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, coming from a more RPG background, I've always seen individual goals achieved as a result of game mechanics that are not designed to achieve goals directly. For example, one guy I'm playing with is playing a swordsman who was exiled from his home village due to false accusations of treason and was robbed of his birthright to leadership. His goal is to win that back so his character will continue gaining power until the whole matter will eventually be resolved with a duel and that will be resolved with combat mechanics, not plot dice or story points and the like. This is just me coming from the whole "design what doesn't matter" approach, though, and I don't think that's what you're looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122360/#Comment_122360" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T11:07:25+00:00" title="January 28, 2008 11:07AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2008 11:14AM by John_Harper.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't believe I forgot to mention Muses from Nine Worlds. They're so great!<br/><br/>Each Muse is a concrete, achievable thing that is important to your character. Like, "Save my child from Saturn and return her to her father." When you win conflicts, you can pump points into your Muses and make them stronger  (they have a maximum value). When a Muse applies to a conflict at hand, you can add its rating to your effectiveness. So, if you get into trouble that involves several of your Muses, you kick ass!<br/><br/>Eventually, you will abandon a Muse (because you accomplish the goal, give up on it, someone makes it impossible to achieve, or whatever). When this happens, the level of the Muse turns into XP and you can use it to upgrade your ability scores.<br/><br/>In play, Muses have been the most fun implementation of a Kicker/Fate/Spiritual Attribute/Key mechanic, to me. They're one of the things that makes Nine Worlds such a fantastic game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122497/#Comment_122497" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T16:50:14+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  4:50PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, John!<br/><br/>That's also a neat suggestion. So, you're rewarded for pursuing a Muse for a long time, and then somehow writing it off. In terms of achievement, it's totally up to the player, though, right? (I mean, it's not mechanically enforced.)<br/><br/>Austin,<br/><br/>What you've described is how my game works *now*. I'm pretty happy with it for the moment, but I'm looking into alternatives, hence this thread.

But stuff that happens in the game can cause a Muse to resolve, even if you didn't want it to. There's a bit of strategy in the game in doing stuff that will resolve your opponent's Muses so she can't smack you with them anymore. That's all determined by in-the-fiction action, though. No "achievement meters" or anything like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122501/#Comment_122501" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T17:02:45+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  5:02PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So... if your opponent has a Muse of "get my daughter to safety", you might try to help, making sure he can get the daughter to safety.., and thereby deprive your opponent of a powerful Muse when the time comes to betray him?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
