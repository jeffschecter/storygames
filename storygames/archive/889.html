                    Hi, this is my first post here at Story Games so please be kind. :P Haven't seen an introductions forum so I'll just dive right in. I hope isn't too dry as it's also my first real AP.<br/>
Part 1:<br/>
<br/>
Background: This was played on ARCON XXII, the gaming convention in Oslo last weekend (June 22-25). IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d seen the program and I knew there was nothing I wanted to play on that Saturday morning, so I made up a poster in beforehand with pictures of popular series and a blurb that said something like Ã¢â‚¬Å“So, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always wanted to play in a TV series? Try PTA!Ã¢â‚¬Â and put it up at the lounge. When I came to the convention that Saturday morning I got three players two of which IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d played with a couple of times before although I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really know any of them. I really donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think any of them had played any Forge game before, but they got the concept after the first couple of scenes. The two I played with before was Lars and Per Eystein, the new guy was Erik.<br/>
<br/>
After making the necessary arrangements, we started making the premise for the series. During the pitch, after IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d made some initial suggestions, the group really clicked on fantasy. The words I got on my sheets are: Fantasy, Evil King, Rebels?, Outlaws, Dirty and Brutal, Plague Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A curse upon the evil king, Shield against the plague over the castle, The Wizards rule the outside, They meet the king once a year, Superstition, Is it possible to heal the plague?<br/>
<br/>
LarsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ character: Johnathan Ã¢â‚¬Å“The BloodfoxÃ¢â‚¬Â Crick. Concept: Ruthless King of Thieves, Issue: Soft hearted towards subjects although he must never show it, Edges: Criminal Mastermind, Connections: Demerus Ã¢â‚¬â€œ WizardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Apprentice, Network of thieves, Nemesis: Vidislav Bremer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Captain of the Guards. Personal Set: The Throne of Thieves.<br/>
<br/>
Per EysteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s character: Prince Florian, Concept: Plague-Stricken Prince, Issue: Vengeance over his brother Hrothgar, Edges: Noble, Idealist, Connections: Amadelia Holtz Ã¢â‚¬â€œ his ex-fiancee, Nemesis: Prince Hrothgar, Personal Set: Locket of Amadelia.<br/>
<br/>
ErikÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s character: Grigor, Concept: Dragonblooded WizardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Apprentice, Issue: Fear of the Beast within, Edges, Dragoonblooded, Mystic, Connections: Sister, Personal Set: While I Study.<br/>
<br/>
The backstory suggested by some of the players was that the King had all but exterminated a cult of Witches. The remainder then put a terrible curse of plague upon the King, but the Wizards manage to shield the KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s castle against the plague, and thus the plague settled upon the land instead. The Wizards had to stay outside to manage the shield. They were the KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s proxies and had the true power on the outside.<br/>
<br/>
It was established that Prince Florian was framed by his younger brother to have the plague and thus was cast out from inside the shield. Hrothgar thus stole both his claim to the throne and his would be wife. Grigor had begun to get scales on a hidden part of his body and had left the Wizrds, because he was afraid further training would make him a beast. Florian and Grigor had been exiled to the slum and picked up by the King of Thieves who thought their skills could come in handy for his oganisation. This had happend before the pilot began. The Bloodfox's Wizard's Apprentice contact was their way inside, through the Shield. After taking a look at the character names we decided that German names was a mark of nobility and English names was a mark of the common people.<br/>
<br/>
The first scene was Inside. They were trying to enter the Royal Library to find the Book of Visions so that Grigor could possibly, see the future and possibly learn more about his dragonblood abilities. In the next scene I added that they also were out to get a family three for a competitior to the Thief-King, who had managed to enlist lots of ex-nobility to his cause by claiming his lineage to a noble family. The reason I added this was because I didn't think the Book of Visions was enough complications. After a conflict they were denied entrance to the library and had to find another way inside. They found a way through the servants quarters and the the next coflict had two stakes. Grigor's stakes was whether the Book of Visions could also learn him about the blood inside him.<br/>
Jonathan's stakes was whether his competitor was in fact a noble or a fraud.<br/>
Both won and the next scene was a showdown in the sewer.<br/>
<br/>
By now the players had gotten the Fan Mail mechanic and had already distributed a couple of points among themsleves and Scene Framing began to flow. Also I had warmed up and getting the feel of the setting and players.<br/>
<br/>
The next player fast forwarded to a meeeting between the PC's and the leader of the competing gang and his henchmen. It was a wonderful dialogue.<br/>
Competitor: "So you've come to make a deal?"<br/>
Bloodfox: "No actally I've come to make you a job offer."<br/>
C: "Work for you? That's ridiculous!" (he said with a haught tone)<br/>
It was then the Bloodfox produced the familytree:<br/>
B: "What did you say you parent's name was again?"<br/>
It ended with the competitor's bodyguard deserting him and him agreeing to take the offer.<br/>
After that I think was a flashback to Prince Florian's last goodbye with his fiancee.<br/>
It was a sentimental scene and had a conflict whether or not she would reject him because of the plague. Per Eystein won both the conflict and the narration, so he had a teardripping goodbye with his loved one until he was innterrupted by his brother and the guards. He had finished his narration but I couldn't resist taking control of Prince Hrothgar for a moment and whispering in Florian's ear "She's mine now." The players oohed and ahhed for the utter bastardness of the Prince.<br/>
Next up was my scene and I established that the characters were in three different places. Florian was in bed with fever, Grigor was studying the Book and having visions and Johnathan was chased by the Guard through the streets of the slum, with Captain Bremer and his bloodhounds in the foreground. In his fever Florian began coughing up blood and feelng worse and worse. I asked Erik what Grigoris visions were and he said it was about the last war of the witches and the Curse: I began telling how the last three witches (a Mother, a Maiden and a Crone) had sacrificed their last lifeblood into their cauldron and green fumes had begun spewing forth towards the castle. In the meanwhile The Bloodfox were hunted by his nemesis through the streets and managed to get up on a roof. Florian began coughing up pieces of meat. Something was also trying to take control of Grigor, a calling in his blood.<br/>
Florian didn't get a conflict, but the two other did. Grigor managed to wrest control of himself from the book, and Johnathan managed to escape his would be captors. I narrated how Florian woke and the sheets he thought were drenched in blood, bore no trace of it. After a meetup in the thieves quarter and another vision, the characters went to a cottage where a man in black joined them together and made a talisman of their blood. It was a sphere of three colours, white, red and black.                </div>

                            Part 2:<br/>
After they returned, they learned that Johnathan's next in command, Maximillian had been captured by Captain Bremer and was probably up for torture. So they planned to get inside and save him before it was too late. Johnathan's soft hearted issue played into it nicely. They tried to get inside, but their ordinary contact wasn't on duty so they had to get in by other means. They mangade to get inside, but the dungeon was watched over by loyal guards. It was established in scene 2 that Florian ahd seen his former Personal Servant reduced to a lackey when they sneaked into the library through the servants quarters. Outside the outer entrance to the dungeon, Florian saw his personal servant and spoke to him. The servant was willing to help him on teh condition that he would try to rebel against his father and if he became king he would be just towards the common people. They mangaed to get clothes and one of the players narrated how another servant told them that they should have been serving drinks to the guests half an hour ago! So an interlude where they played servants and Florian hanaged to speak with his loved one under the guise of serving her a drink. She said she would shelter them and they should meet her maid in the gardens. They managed to get out and sneak through the kitchen to the servant's entrance to the dungeon. It was guarded only by the brutish but stupid Bolg. (When I told them the name of the guard I had forgotten the reference but when a player said "Yes I gather he was brutish enough!" I suddenly remembered my Tolkien.) They managed to get past Bolg, and face the torturer. They saved Maximillian and left the torturer on the Rack. Maximillian couldn't resist giving the wheel a couple of extra turns.<br/>
<br/>
The last scene they met in the garden a little while later and met Amadelia's maid. She should lead them to shelter, but suddenly they heard an alarm and the bloodhounds.<br/>
It was the last scene so I pushed the players towards conclusion. Probably too much, but the ending wasn't bad. They fled the hounds towards the shield and Johnathan recognized the black coat of Captain Bremer. They reached the shield and couldn't get through. It was then that Prince Florian who had the sphere, fell through the shield. He helped his friends and the maid through as well and they ridiculed the Guard that was trapped behind the shield.<br/>
<br/>
The good and the bad, coming up soon.                        </div>
