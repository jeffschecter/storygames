In Portland, Oregon.<br/><br/>(cross-posted to <a href="http://www.goplaypdx.com" rel="nofollow">goplaypdx</a>, in case anyone is here who isn't also there.)<br/><br/>Here's what's going down: I want a weekly game. <i>Bad</i>. So I'm going to hustle this thing and see if something doesn't happen.<br/><br/>This is going to happen on <b>Tuesday</b> nights, at <b>6:30pm</b>. We'll play at my house (details on the place to come later, in a personal message or email), unless someone else wants to volunteer to host.<br/><br/>What we'll play: most anything. I've never had a good experience with a traditional game, so I'm open but unexcited about that option.<br/><br/>Ideally, if we start playing a game I'd like to play it for at least 3 sessions (barring games that are just good one-shots). I'm open to rotating games a lot, with a few sessions of each, or latching onto one and grooving it into longer play.<br/><br/>Following is a list of every game I own, all of which I want to play and/or GM. You want to play a game that's not on this list? Chances are, so do I! Tell us, and we'll figure it out together.<br/><br/>Breaking the Ice<br/>Burning Empires<br/>Burning Wheel<br/>--The Blossoms Are Falling<br/>--Under a Serpent Sun<br/>Capes<br/>Dogs in the Vineyard<br/>Everway<br/>Houses of the Blooded<br/>In a Wicked Age<br/>InSpectres<br/>Kill Puppies for Satan<br/>Mouse Guard<br/>Nicotine Girls<br/>Orkworld<br/>A Penny For My Thoughts<br/>Polaris<br/>Sorcerer<br/>--Dictionary of Mu<br/>Shooting the Moon<br/>Steal Away Jordan<br/>Sweet Agatha<br/>Urchin<br/>XXXXtreme STREET luge<br/><br/><br/>And I think that's all I have. It occurs to me to mention the games I'm most excited about playing right now. Like I said, I will play all of the above and more, but what I'm most excited about right now is, in no particular order: Mouse Guard, Burning Empires, Dogs in the Vineyard, Houses of the Blooded, Polaris, and Dictionary of Mu.<br/><br/>When will we start? ASAP.<br/><br/>Who's in?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
