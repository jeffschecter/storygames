Once a week we get together. Time is a tight commodity for everyone, so we jump righ in and start gaming. We really want to get as much out of it as we can, so we game right up to the time everyone needs to go home. The result is that we don't talk about gaming. Even though we've got all this great stuff happening at the table, there are few opportunities to chat about it informally afterwards.<br/><br/>We've done a few things to fix this. Over the summer, I hosted a few low-pressure afternoon gaming sessions. We ended up talking as much as we gamed. A few times we were able to extend the socializing over dinner. Some of our group meet regularly for lunch or dinner, giving them a chance to talk about stuff. The benefit of this has been immeasurable. I think it's strengthened our gaming and especially our friendships.<br/><br/>I'm curious to hear if other people have similar experiences. How do you maintain a mix of socialization and gaming?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171928/#Comment_171928" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T12:22:25+00:00" title="September 29, 2008 12:22PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 29, 2008 12:32PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm big on lots of socializing.  While I try to keep an eye on the clock (and often fail!) as current GM and Gavel Holder, I'll let the group ramble on for an hour or an hour and a half before we settle in to the game at hand.<br/><br/>Last night we gathered to create characters for our new <i>Traveller</i> game.  Before we played:<br/><br/>Eric regaled us with a tale of D&amp;D4e woe he suffered through two nights earlier<br/>which led to a discussion about GM habits (good and bad) and what people expect the fun to be, and how some GM's simply have no idea that what they think is fun for the players <i>isn't</i>...<br/>Which led to Colin telling us a CoC tale of woe from some years ago<br/>we had a brief discussion of BioWare's Mass Effect for the XBox that I had recently started playing<br/>we sort of started setting up world details about the <i>Traveller</i> game, that looped back to issues of canon in RPG settings, the flexibility or inflexibility some people hold on the matter, referencing threads and posts on this site<br/><br/>Pre-game conversations also involve talk about World of Warcraft, boardgames, movies, long-form cable shows like Dexter, The Wire, and The Shield and other things.<br/><br/>I like it because it for the pleasure of talking about fun stuff with my smart players.  I consider socializing to be what RPGs are about.  Wrapping it up in other kinds of socializing is cool.  I basically said, "We will just hang out before we play.  We're here to socialize."  One of my players then added, "Without that, it's like eating a meal only of appetizers."  I said, "Yes!  Exactly!"<br/><br/>That all said, once play begins (whether character creation or in-story-play) we're pretty focused.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171930/#Comment_171930" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-29T12:23:53+00:00" title="September 29, 2008 12:23PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In one group, we eat together first.

To take my UA game as an example, we usually spend an hour before game eating, and half an hour or so after game talking (and slowly making our way to the door).  Our gaming time is tight, yeah, but I'd way prefer spending an hour and a half of "gaming time" to be "talk and eat and be people outside of the game" time.

Any players in those games that seem unwilling or uninterested to chat and enjoy our game time  for the social element of our hobby is what I consider to be "convention style" games.<br/><br/>If I'm not gaming with friends that are interested in chatting socially (and in this type social group - that almost inherently means and includes talking about games)  then I'd rather be doing anything else...<br/><br/><br/>I do a couple things along this line with the groups I game with.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.  I always "plan" to ONLY start the game 10-15 minutes AFTER the last player arrives.  This allows that players (and me as host) to feel comfortable and relaxed, grabbing a snack or drink and ALSO allowing some time to catch up socially as a group of friends before getting into game mode.  I also plan for a similar 10-15 minutes of post game time to CLEAN-UP our play area (my little apt) that also includes time to chat.  I really really really don't enjoy (hate) not having that time.  It makes me uncomfortable as a host and (I feel) makes the group not function as smoothly if "forced" immediately into game.  <br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.  I actually plan what I call "maintenance sessions" now and then.  Sometimes this will happen when one player can't make it... Sometimes I'll plan it when everyone can be there.  The goal is to take care of any updating on character sheets, notes for game, and generally talking about a "state of the union" of the game - where it's going and what we can do to make it better for all...<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>.  I encourage (by DOING) lots of chat by email (I use Yahoo Groups) in-between game sessions.  Generally discussion will evolve from my "Goods/Bads/Ugly" game review requests.  Sometimes discussions start about non-game game things or things that we all naturally enjoy (like a new movie or event in town).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>.  I have a few game group friends that enjoy the analyzation and discussion of gaming, GMing, and the psychology of gaming  and/or  any non-game gamer hobby things.  I hang with those folk regularly following games for hours after game  or  sometimes gathering to have dinner or something specifically to have fun discussing such things.  I've had some of the BEST conversations on politics, religion, and dozens of other societal discussions during these times -  learning more about my friends (and being exposed to new ideas myself) during these times.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%235&amp;Mode=like">#5</a>.  Before new campaigns my groups will generally gather for 1-2 "game" sessions to discuss the new game options.  Deciding on the game, talking about tone, theme, style, interests, etc... Many times we'll "design" player characters and/or the setting together during these times.  My Saturday group JUST did the first part of one of these sessions.  We narrowed our next campaign option down to 2 game ideas.  Next gathering we'll determine the game of choice then design PCs together and any story/setting elements together.  Perhaps watch a movie that sets the tone or whatever.  Then plan to PLAY the next week.<br/><br/><br/><br/>If I'm not doing this type discussion I get frustrated and bored with the game/group.<br/>I tend to believe that if the game ISN'T evoking the DESIRE to chat about it OUT-of-game, then the GM's not capturing the attention of the players for some reason - which could also be an indication that not all the players are really enjoying the current game.<br/>I don't think this should be forced...  That can be destructive in its own way (some players really feel like it becomes "work" if they feel like they're EXPECTED to reply or discuss)  and that's NOT good.<br/>But in general - I look at it as my job (as GM) to aid the group to be at a high point of interest in the game/campaign to inspire desire to chat about the game OUT-of-game.<br/><br/>fun fun<br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_173622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/173622/#Comment_173622" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-06T15:18:54+00:00" title="October  6, 2008  3:18PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Tony, is there a distinction for you?

I think that your game can probably only really prosper if you have a chance to talk about it. In my own life, I've carved out a space where I know I'll get to play every week. I still don't know if I'll get to talk about it every week. Socializing is part of it, because socializing with your gaming group is in the same neighborhood as talking about the game. But it doesn't take the place of actually talking about the game.<br/><br/>When we get together and talk we know:<br/>- Who's happy or unhappy about how the game is going<br/>- Who's excited about what games or techniques and who isn't<br/>- Who's working on a cool idea they want to bring to the table<br/>- Who needs a break from what we've been playing lately.<br/><br/>When we don't talk, things happen at the table that make us go "huh?" We don't really understand what's happening at the table, because we lack the context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_174355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/174355/#Comment_174355" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-09T13:35:08+00:00" title="October  9, 2008  1:35PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            YES.
