First up was Cowboys With Big Hearts, which is a hyper-focused GM-heavy RPG that uses cards to build and then destroy characters. Here's a dude, mid-session:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/cowboys_with_big_hearts/cwbh_01.jpg"/><br/>Dreamation provided four players I'd never met before and they were all great. A pretty wide-ranging group, plus Jason Lorenzetti, who I know and like from Nerdly. The game's designed for up to six, so it was a decent sized group. The playtest went smoothly and together they discovered - and conquered - a gang of freaky Mexican cannibals. None of the cowboys was overcome by their illnesses, and I'm coming to realize what a delicate and heavy burden the design places on the GM. This may be problematic - I really need to get this in the hands of people who are not me at this point. One player was very clear in his dislike for some of the game's assumptions, which was valuable and insightful feedback. A definite success.<br/><br/>Next (literally, one after the other) was Medical Hospital, which I haven't played in a year and has changed drastically. The game plays like a soap opera, but conflicts are resolved through an intense arts-and-crafts surgical routine, which is weird and fun. Here's Witt performing a renal neurectomy:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games//medical_hospital/mh_02.jpg"/><br/>This game really took off when Eric and Laura Larsen showed up - they were funny, engaged players who gave Witt and I a welcome assist. What I learned is that the surgery is fun, but my timing needs to be tweaked, and that the two games really cry out to be capable of functioning when decoupled, which they currently are not. So I have a lot of number-adjusting to do, and need to figure some things out to make the roleplaying piece fun on its own. A hugely valuable playtest that wasn't particularly smooth, but still a lot of fun thanks to Witt, Eric and Laura's enthusiasm. <br/><br/>How about you? Did you playtest, as a player or designer? How did it go? What did you learn?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258044/#Comment_258044" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T07:52:25+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  7:52AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played Swords without Master, Eppy's new game in playtest. It rocked.<br/><br/>It felt a bit like a storytelling game and made my "conch-shell-passing game" nerves twitch a bit, but I had a ton of fun, so shut up, right? I made people annoyed with me accidentally, since I was alternating playing in a "just have fun style" but also an analytical, "will this break Eppy's game?" style. In the latter mode, I let Eppy (as <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">GM</span>OverPlayer) continue to narrate awful things happening to our group. I knew he couldn't actually kill anyone. I wanted to understand how far it could go. I was surprised that other players got annoyed at a very artificial loss of positioning (that is, it was illusory, since there is no game currency that gives the loss of positioning "teeth"). There was probably also some feeling that I was hogging the spotlight, but I wasn't, since I wasn't talking and Eppy's narration was about everyone, not about me. But I had the dice and I wasn't giving them up until I had let Eppy narrate a suitably dark position for our group. The other players coined the phrase, "to Dray a game."

Emily, Jason, and Rachel played in the playtest, so we got to try the new older sibling rules for four players. This revealed the first problem with the game as is. The current version of the document, has the older sibling rules at the end and I needed to keep the pages split so that I could look at the rules for the normal configuration and then refer to the older sibling rules. I'm considering doing the whole game as a deck of cards, so this may be less of a problem in the long run, but for the short term I need to rework the playtest document.<br/><br/>We decided that I would play the child, Emily and Jason played the parents, and Rachel played the older sibling. Character creation seemed to work really well, to flesh out the characters, but the initial Interlude was a little flat and the game should probably start with some Chase scenes since the Obstacle cards provide a pretty clear creative shot in the arm to get everything started. The flow of Chase scenes was definitely the part where I was most unsure about the design, but I was honest about this with the group and we came up with a nice procedure that flows pretty well in those scenes. <br/><br/>The Obstacle cards that I drew really flowed well together and with the details that we were making up as we went along. I'm a little worried that I simply got lucky, but I did learn that the cards should not name dinosaurs. It's really not an important detail, and actually limits their usefulness.<br/><br/>Finally, we tightened up the ending conditions to be a bit more reasonable, with some discussion of advice in the text for when the game should end. All in all, I think it was a good playtest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258479/#Comment_258479" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T09:58:01+00:00" title="February 25, 2010  9:58AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was prepared to run for 3-4 players.<br/><br/>I asked Vinny for 3 playtesters, fearing that I wouldn't be able to rope in anyone else.  He picked Michele, Scott, and Phil, and told me enough about them for me to think they might enjoy my game.<br/><br/>A few days later, I got an email from Avie listing my playtesters as Michele, Phil, and Rebecca.  I asked who was Rebecca and what happened to Scott?  She called me and gave me a glowing report on Rebecca.<br/><br/>I emailed the 3 playtesters to make sure they were into my game.  Michele and Rebecca gave brief but enthusiastic yeses.  Phil did not reply on that score, instead answering only the questions about favorite adventuring activities.<br/><br/>At the con, the sign-up form had 8 boxes, not 4.  Frank signed up, followed by Matt, followed by someone I don't remember.  When I discovered this, I listed Matt and the other guy as "Alternates".  I told Matt the deal.  He said he'd swing by in case someone bailed.<br/><br/>Phil never showed up.<br/><br/>Rebecca, Michele, Frank and Matt all did an excellent job playing the game, enjoying it for what it was.<br/><br/>Afterward, everyone stayed to discuss for quite a while.  It was really helpful to hear Rebecca and Michele's perspectives.  That said, most of the design-useful feedback came from Frank and Matt, who stuck around until 2:30 to critique and brainstorm.  It was really amazing -- there was none of the "make your game do what <i><b>I</b></i> want it to do" stuff that usually comes up in design chat.  Everyone really got my goals and tried to help me with those.<br/><br/>Michele had some good points about usability of materials, especially the character sheet.  Rebecca's perspective was great to have, as a veteran "trad-style" gamer with no particular interest in design -- probably my target audience.  All 4 players were really coming from different places, so the breadth was fantastic.<br/><br/>I know now that, when run correctly, Delve may have a little broader appeal than the niche within a niche within a niche that I've assumed.  The key continues to be reducing the amount of work needed to run it correctly.  I really, really, really need someone else to GM this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258480/#Comment_258480" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T10:03:43+00:00" title="February 25, 2010 10:03AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave Cleaver, it is really awesome to see your idea that Bill and I poked at for a (2 am delirious) hour at Dreamation 2009 coming into its own!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_258525">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258525/#Comment_258525" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-25T13:03:51+00:00" title="February 25, 2010  1:03PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How did the Fifth World go?

Distilling it down a bit, my major take-away lessons are:<br/><br/>(1) The coin thing is wonky as all hell. Probably needs to be jettisoned entirely.<br/><br/>(2) Fluency play is good. The current version doesn't do it hard enough.<br/><br/>(3) Key phrases are awesome. Keep them.<br/><br/>If not the coin economy, I think I need something else to tie everything together, even if only to give the key phrases something to chew on. If I can figure out a way to represent relationships that doesn't take so much book-keeping, that might be the way to go.<br/><br/>I ran four playtests at Dreamation. I had a map printed up, about which I must first geek out. <em>The Fifth World</em> posits global warming becoming self-reinforcing until the ice caps disappear entirely. So, I looked up stuff like ice volume at the poles, change in volume when ice melts into water, and what that would mean for sea level rise. I got 88 meters. So, I went into Google Earth, zoomed in on Morristown, added a big blue square, and set it to 88 meters, giving me what the coastline would look like in the Fifth World. Turns out Morristown is just barely 88 meters above sea level, so I had my beaches of translucent plastic sand like a mile from the ruins of the hotel. I got a screen-shot, turned it into a vector map, imported it into Photoshop, and gave it a treatment so it looked like a map burned into worn leather. I put a logo in one corner and a quick summary of the key phrases on one side, added some of the art my wife Giuli has done, sent it to Kinko's to print out poster-sized, and then had it laminated so we could use wet erase markers, and I could erase between sessions.<br/><br/>I ran four playtests with this, and I took note of the places and stories that wound up on the map at the end of each one. At the beginning of each new session, I wrote down some of the key places and stories from the preceding stories. So, we wound up with this four-session campaign that played out during the con, about some of the Mountain Folk moving down towards the sea and establishing a new village. They didn't expect to find people already living down there, and that ultimately led to some hostilities, including a conspiracy between our people and theirs, with certain individuals hoping to drive us to war so they could emerge from the violence as leaders. Then we met the wild people (hunters who forget their humanity become, essentially, sasquatch; see Pat Murphy's "In the Abode of the Snows"), who guard the land. In the end, they destroyed our village because we started trophy hunting the local mountain lions. In the end, we established peace with our neighbors, and we ended with a really great downbeat, with a nice little love story that left a general sense that after everything, we'll be OK.<br/><br/>I'm thinking I'll bring it next year and try something similar\u2014what happens to the village one year later.<br/><br/>I got a lot of really great ideas for ways to introduce big, detailed settings in small, bite-sized chunks. As I said, I'm still decompressing and processing it all. Thanks to everyone who played it, you all gave me some really great ideas, and seeing what you did with the game really helped me a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
