I also was the coordinator of Game Chef Brazil, which elected Pulse, and it turned out to win the Game Chef World.<br/><br/>As some of you may know, or imagine, Brazilian game designers have been through a thriving process: lots of ideas happening, not many of them getting published or turning into products. There are several initiatives and many people excited to produce, many more to consume, new ways of playing. And I happen to be in touch with several of them.<br/><br/>It occurred to me that game designers would benefit enormously from English-translated version of their work, and discussing with some friend, the idea of a Patreon for translating all these cool mini-games could help other people to come into contact with a glimpse of the kind of work it's been done here and help them release other projects in the future.<br/><br/>What do you guys think? Would this be an interesting project? Would you pay for something like that? How much? <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428388/#Comment_428388" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-18T12:17:16+00:00" title="February 18, 2014 12:17PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 18, 2014 12:17PM by catty_big.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I said on then ReForged site, I'd potentially be very interested in this, but I'm likewise unsure about how to cost such projects, so I'd welcome the input of peeps experienced in this area.
