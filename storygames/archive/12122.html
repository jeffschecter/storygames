It's a Fiasco-type movie. And there were several moments in the movie where I thought. "Oh, they are actually going to let him be rewarded for bad behavior." But didn't. And that was a touch disappointing for me. But ,overall, I had this feeling that I was watching "real" characters in a "real" world, and that there is this complicated world simulation playing out, and I'm watching the characters all deal with the consequences of their interactions with that, and with each other. I totally dug that.<br/><br/>But there are many times, watching movies, when it feels like I can palpably detect the creator reaching down and saying "Oh, no. That's won't do! I've got Something to Say now." And that sucks for me.<br/><br/>The movie "Ghost Writer" was utterly pointless and ruined for me, because I knew exactly, right on down the line, what the creator was going to do. There was no chance he was going to deviate from his Important Message, and the result was more propaganda than movie.<br/><br/>Now, "Greenberg" was informative for me, because the situation wasn't really ripe enough. It was a good movie, but was a little flat. The characters were able to make decisions for themselves, there was no interceding hand, but not a rich enough situation. I think of it as not having enough Bangs.<br/><br/>In computer games, I can't stand playing the usual "Hey, shut up and listen to my awesome story" style games that dominate AAA console gaming. I'd much rather play Dwarf Fortress.<br/><br/>So, in a good Role-Playing game: I like for the characters and setting and color to be set up strongly, to give a direction and purpose. I like the world to be rich with Bangs, so that it doesn't fall flat. And I like a sense that consequences arise not because someone decided that it was time for some Awesome or because it was an Important Commentary, but because the consequence was a natural outcome of the actions and decisions portrayed within the game world.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271452/#Comment_271452" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-15T15:53:41+00:00" title="May 15, 2010  3:53PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2010 3:59PM by nemomeme.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: marknau</cite>But there are many times, watching movies, when it feels like I can palpably detect the creator reaching down and saying "Oh, no.

And it's more about how the ham-handed way it's done than specifically the fact that the creator had Something to Say.  Go ahead and make that movie, certainly, but let the actors' interpretations and the experiences of the observers "bring something to the table" as it were.<br/><br/>Many in this community will feel similarly.

"Oooh, I thought it was <i>this</i> kind of movie but it turns out it wasn't!  How delightful and surprising!"<br/><br/>I like the elements of Burning Wheel/TSOY/Lady Blackbird that say "my character goes <i>this</i> way with great vigor, driving interesting situations." Until they suddenly <b>don't</b> any more and instead do something completely "uncharacteristic," hopefully for reasons that seem plausible within the fiction.  The player makes that decision when.  It's a great feeling when the player themselves didn't even see it coming even though they are the "writer" for that character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271458/#Comment_271458" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-15T16:55:33+00:00" title="May 15, 2010  4:55PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: marknau</cite>But there are many times, watching movies, when it feels like I can palpably detect the creator reaching down and saying "Oh, no.

For decades now, literary critics have understood it to be their task to translate the elements of the poem or play or novel or story into something else. Sometimes a writer will be so uneasy before the naked power of his art that he will install within the work itself - albeit with a little shyness, a touch of the good taste of irony - the clear and explicit interpretation of it. Thomas Mann is an example of such an overcooperative author. In the case of more stubborn authors, the critic is only too happy to perform the job. </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271508/#Comment_271508" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-16T02:20:49+00:00" title="May 16, 2010  2:20AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2010 2:23AM by Potemkin.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: marknau</cite>But there are many times, watching movies, when it feels like I can palpably detect the creator reaching down and saying "Oh, no.

For example, <i>Big Trouble in Little China</i> conforms to the expectations of its genre without saying a great deal, whereas <i>There Will be Blood</i>, for all of its subversion of genre, is a trifle heavy-handed in its polemics. Having the action of the film <i>say</i> something has little to do with conforming to genre tropes. <br/><br/>For me, Genre expectations are those keys, shall we say, that the audience wants the movie to hit. It's a matter of expectation making a transition to satisfaction. If I enter a cinema expecting to see an Action Film, I want Action (and its associated precepts; explosions, machismo, fights etc) - which is why <i>Clash of the Titans</i> sucked; there simply wasn't not enough action to satisfy my expectations.<br/>Of course, clever directors/producers play on our desire for satisfaction. <i>500 Days of Summer</i> denies us the satisfactions associated with Romance films, but the film is successful in this as the audience is 'let in' on the joke. Films, especially Hollywood productions, that subvert their own genres tend to be bare-faced about their deviance, so as not to alienate or frustrate their audience. I can think of a few Schwarzenegger films that have film cast in the lead <i>just</i> to play this game. <br/><br/>The gripe, for genre expectations, as you've pointed out in the movie thread is not that the film wants to say something, but that the characters, events and situations are predetermined by the genre. This, in cinema, is fine and dandy and we can all have fun as a passive audience watching Post Modernist deviance, but around the gaming table where we are active Creators/Consumers, both audience <i>and</i> director, the experience can be frustrating; we have intimate insight into these characters and situations, and can be far more subtle and ingenious in their manipulation. <br/><br/>Of course, there's much to be said for <i>Getting It Right</i> and following genre. All the players understand (usually) what certain characters want and how situations should resolve to be satisfying experiences (the existence of games with 'mook' enemies is proof of this tendency). The prevalence of genre-gaming attests to the ease of play and high rate of satisfaction that comes from conformity. <br/><br/>Genre, for me, is a way of negotiating the shared imagination - reading from the same page. Otherwise, it's a matter of falling back onto reality to help us conciliate and run the risk of ceasing to tell a story and start running a simulation. Even games that break with genre have to create their own tropes to facilitate satisfying play. <br/><br/>I'm sure I was going to deliver a more level-headed argument for and against genre, but I've lost my train of thought. I'll return later.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271529/#Comment_271529" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-16T08:11:55+00:00" title="May 16, 2010  8:11AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, that seemed very level-headed to me! And it all seems sensible to me. So let me qualify that what I write below is meant to address MY particular aesthetic, and not try to speak to any sort of universal rules of storytelling.<br/><br/>For me, my investment in the story is firmly based on its authenticity. And for me, that means getting a sense that the story is the outcome of a simulation. And, yes, I know stories are not made that way. But there is a craft to making it seem authentic, and some storytellers also seem to care about that and produce works that I like. "There Will Be Blood" seemed very authentic to me. Everything that happened seemed like it flowed from the actions and decisions of the characters, particularly that main character with his incredible will.<br/><br/>Now, I can also get by just on "Being Clever." I don't enjoy most TV, but The West Wing was very watchable for me, as was some Gilmore Girls. Both of them were just watching these clever people doing clever things and spouting clever lines. But I didn't care about them or their world. They were silly puppets hitting each other with sticks for my amusement.<br/><br/>Strong genre expectation sucks for me because it undermines (my sense of) authenticity. It is a ride on rails. And even when subversion of the genre is on the table, often it is done so ham-handed (to my aesthetic), that I also lose a sense of authenticity.<br/><br/>So now to gaming. As you say, genre is very useful shorthand for getting on the same page. But if there are strong genre expectations, like that Jenna's character will never have anything permanently bad happen to her. Well, suckage. "Getting it Right" play is not appealing to me at all.<br/><br/>What I want from a game is a system that makes us earn it when we want to do something, will visit authentic consequences upon characters, and limits our ability to arbitrarily muck with the "simulation." And yet has mechanisms for getting characters into positions where they have to make choices. Oh, and I don't have a lot of time for prep work. I'm a pain in the butt, I know.<br/><br/>Fortunately, I don't need 100% alignment. I've enjoyed many of the games commonly discussed around here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271535/#Comment_271535" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-16T09:27:50+00:00" title="May 16, 2010  9:27AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2010 4:03PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Mark,<br/><br/>As far as I can tell, our tastes match up almost perfectly. (Am I surprised? No. I am not.)<br/><br/>Craft-wise, one of the big problems with THE GHOST WRITER is that the main character drives pretty much nothing of the story. In fact, he has no agenda and drives nothing on his own.<br/><br/>He doesn't want the job. He doesn't want the money (his agent wants the money). He doesn't care about politics. He has no loyalty to one political agenda/government/lover or anyone. When he finally gets around to choosing to invest in the mystery, it is not because of a need on his part, but because his car's GPS system thwarts his desire to escape the situation. He is, literally, chauffeured deeper into the plot.<br/><br/>The need for a passionate character passionate about <i>something</i>, with the passions in turn causing the character to take actions of consequence are clear here. And the consequences of lack of such construction for a character are revealed in THE GHOST WRITER.<br/><br/>In short, he is a puppet to be moved around for the needs of the statement: "There are bad people in the world... and, by the way, here's who they are."<br/><br/>I'm going to reference the BOURNE IDENTITY now, since the bad guys are the same bad guys, still up to nefarious deeds and manipulating people to their own ends.<br/><br/>Jason Bourne desperately needs to know who he is.  This is not a plot contrivance. Though it is the core of the plot, it is at the core of every one of Jason Bourne's decisions. But this need to know, "Who am I?" is an incredibly human desire and situation. His decisions are his alone, driving forward with the story. After all, he has the skills he requires to simply <i>escape</i>. He could flee the world and hide and forget about finding out who he is. Moreover, he could leave behind the question of "Am I a good man or a bad man?" -- because his flashbacks suggest he has done things that are bad, but he really doesn't know who he is.<br/><br/>In the first movie, there is nothing personal that drives the character, so we are left with the bland politics of a bland thriller. In the second, Tony Gilroy came along and retooled the bland thriller first drafts of the script into personal tale that makes it not about bland politics but a human question about how for our guy will go to find out who he really is.<br/><br/>I believe in these two movies we can see, in game terms, the difference between the PC trotted out along the the GM's "mystery" and an open-ended character driven piece where the desires of the lead characters drive all the action forward.<br/><br/><br/>I want to add that your view on "genre" matches mine.  I believe genre is a boondoggle when it comes to acts of creativity. It's great for marketing -- and don't get me wrong... that is no small thing. People want to know what they're paying for, and if they want such and such a thing and they see an ad campaign that promises that thing, they can buy a ticket certain they are getting what they want.<br/><br/>But in terms of making something, the thought that if one has tapped a lot of genre buttons one has a tale worth telling is disproved by SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW, any Steven Seagal movie, and most genre movies in the straight to DVD bin.<br/><br/>In my view (and I admit upfront, this is me) genre is fun, but should be grown out of the needs of the characters driving the story forward. Genre, for me, is taking human issues and "turning the volume to 11" to shape the material to something something bigger than life. The genre elements focus the issues of being human in an "order of magnitude," as Aristotle put it in The Poetics.  Thus, genre elements are there to exaggerate the human elements of the tale, not to support the tale on their own.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271578/#Comment_271578" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-16T15:52:21+00:00" title="May 16, 2010  3:52PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christopher,<br/><br/>No, not surprising that our tastes match.
