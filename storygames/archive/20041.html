It's an answer in retrospect; an answer that comes from assuming that a dice mechanic is needed and then making up the reason of why it's needed.<br/><br/>Do take a step back and <i>really </i>question the why. The title of the OP takes the stand that there must exist a dice mechanic, but the post itself questions the use of it. The title is like assuming that cars must be black, and then question what else can be black, instead of asking what colors a car can have.<br/><br/>I'm not asking to remove uncertainty, but what else we can ask from a cinematic game.<br/><br/>I'm not saying a dice-less game will have it easier to bring that cinematic feeling.

Maybe some meta-mechanics about the story privilege or penalize different players at different times, a la the Tension and Survival tracks in Dead of Night.  Neat, right?

If you define a concrete way to judge scale and length and a concrete way to translate those into stakes and probability, you might have something!<br/><br/>One idea: have different resolution methods for different cinematic moments.  So, like, rather than categories like "stealth" and "strength" or "physical" and "mental", you could have categories like "barely possible", "asking for trouble", "risking it all", "escaping certain death", etc.  And then when you do something, we see which of these categories fits, and roll accordingly.  So "barely possible" would have low probability of total success and all sorts of fallout, while "escaping certain death" would be guaranteed success but many different degrees of role reversal vs just barely escaping, etc.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443054/#Comment_443054" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-21T07:42:04+00:00" title="February 21, 2015  7:42AM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2015 7:47AM by phoenix182.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm reflecting what could be <b>a good dice-based resolve mechanic from a cinematic perspective</b>.<br/><br/><i>The more I think about it, the more stats like skills etc. seem to be just marginal factors.

Once I realized that attributes were largely irrelevant in the superhero genre (either you're relatively on par with something, or you're over/under-classed by at least an order of magnitude) I was able to somewhat unify the attributes/skills/feats/powers/abilities/traits bloat for our game, and that made ALL the difference.

Your example? Your argument is only valid for one type of style of roleplaying games. I do however agree that there are other ways of bringing uncertainty (and uncertainty is a must for several reason that I wont go into now).<br/><br/>I think <a href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">@phoenix182</a> nails it in the first three paragraphs.<br/><br/>There are a lot of assumptions of how roleplaying games should be in this thread. Look at <a href="/forums/profile/2097%27s">@2097's</a> post and the assumptions that character death must be a part of a (cinematic) roleplaying game experience.<br/><br/>I think the question should be:<br/>1) why do you want to play?<br/>2 a) how can the feeling of the cinematic achieve that?<br/>or (even better[?])<br/>2 b) how can you get a cinematic feeling by achieving the answer to the first question.<br/><br/>If the answer to the second question(s) <i>happens</i> to be a dice mechanic, then we can talk. But don't try to justify using a dice mechanic by coming up with arguments why. Come instead up with design goals of your game and look at what game design solutions there are to achieve that. Because right now, there is a lot of leaps going on, in how to construct a game system, because we got the assumptions that I have pointed out.<br/><br/>It's like me always assuming that we need rice to all receipts. How can we make the best cinematic themed food based on rice?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443065/#Comment_443065" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-21T13:04:28+00:00" title="February 21, 2015  1:04PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2015 1:07PM by 2097.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not so much that I'm looking to play games about cinema, it's more that I want to play games about overcoming or succumbing to great risk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443066/#Comment_443066" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-21T13:13:45+00:00" title="February 21, 2015  1:13PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2015 2:56PM by Rickard.">edited February 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here is an example of how I designed <b>This is Pulp</b>, which is a cinematic storytelling game.<br/><b><br/>Design goals</b><br/>I want to challenge the players' creativity.<br/>I want to have the participants collaborate to gain a feeling of togetherness.<br/>I want the game to be short. 1-2 hours of gameplay.<br/><br/><b>Requirements</b><br/>Uncertainty<br/>Challenge<br/><br/>To achieve that, I use the participants knowledge about the tropes from action adventure movies. Movies like Indiana Jones, King Kong, Tintin, The Rocketeer, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. Because if you know something, you're more keen on participating. Also, pulp lack prestige and can be silly and humoristic, which removes some of the anxiety that can come from being creative with other people (the thinking pattern that humor requires also enhances creativity, but that's another story).<br/><br/>The game master set up scenes and create dangers in each scene. That person throws in a couple of tokens (the tokens are a pacing mechanics, allowing me to control how long the game takes). The players need to come up with as many ways of overcoming the dangers as tokens. The challenge is that they need to use their hero's abilities AND involve three side effects in their descriptions. So they need to take at most five different things into account:<br/>1. The situation itself (danger + environment).<br/>2. The abilities (also colored by the alternative 1930s world).<br/>3-5: the three side effects.<br/><br/>It so happens that the player can choose to spend a resource to avoid some, or all, of the side effects, and a die roll is a required when they do that. The thing is, I mostly threw the dice in because some people like to roll dice. The game master then takes the player's description into account to tell how the situation gets worse, up until the very last token is taken for that scene. Then create a new scene with a new danger and new tokens.<br/><br/>Did I need a dice mechanic? No. The uncertainty came from the game master's initial danger and the players' descriptions, and it certainly didn't break the flow because it was part of the gameplay.<br/><br/>The tokens are, by the way, how I took <a href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee%27s">@BeePeeGee's</a> parameters into account.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443067/#Comment_443067" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-02-21T13:41:29+00:00" title="February 21, 2015  1:41PM">February 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I just plain like rolling dice, Rickard. <br/><br/>I'm certainly open to designs that don't use them, especially when a design starts to move away from a static, table and chairs and permanent seating arrangement.<br/><br/>Also, just to throw some weirdness in here, I actually bought some colored, blank dice at one point and began experimenting with them in designs.
