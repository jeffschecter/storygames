My second published game (albeit in beta form) now has <a href="https://www.rpggeek.com/rpgitem/181302/where-heart-beta-version" rel="nofollow">its own page</a> on RPGGeek. There are extracts from the book that give you an idea of what kind of game it is, and some session reports to show how it works out in practice. The first session report is up already, and there are another two in the queue for moderation. Hoping some o' y'all will be interested in facilitating and/or playing it. If you are, it's <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product_info.php?currency=GBP&amp;products_id=141790&amp;affiliate_id=32567" rel="nofollow">available now on DriveTHRU RPG</a>: print copy \xa33, PDF free. <br/><br/>Apologies for appearing to plug another forum. It's just that's easier to collect and display all the related published material (such as session reports and reviews etc.) that way.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
