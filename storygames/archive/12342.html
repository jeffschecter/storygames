We talk about how well Dirty Secrets emulates this genre of fiction, the unique complications that can arise if children are included as characters, and since it's a "GMless" we talk about how the game's structure replaces the role of GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nLinks:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://spookyouthouse.com/" rel="nofollow">Spooky Outhouse Productions</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://spookyouthouse.com/forum/index.php?board=81.0" rel="nofollow">Actual People, Actual Play forum</a> at Spooky Outhouse Productions<br/>\n<br/>\nEmail the show at actualpeopleactualplay@gmail.com<br/>\n<br/>\nFollow us on Twitter <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://twitter.com/LauraBishop" rel="nofollow">Laura</a>, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://twitter.com/jburneko" rel="nofollow">Jesse</a>, and <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://twitter.com/Will_H_" rel="nofollow">Will</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe Wikipedia entry on <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardboiled" rel="nofollow">Hardboiled</a> detective novels.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.darkomengames.com/secrets.html" rel="nofollow">Dirty Secrets</a> from <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.darkomengames.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">Dark Omen Games</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276940/#Comment_276940" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T09:02:55+00:00" title="June 20, 2010  9:02AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What porn stars?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WillH" title="WillH"><img alt="WillH" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v488/Telpierion/minitardisicon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WillH">WillH</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276964/#Comment_276964" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T12:35:25+00:00" title="June 20, 2010 12:35PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No actual porn stars were involved in this episode.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277168/#Comment_277168" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T16:48:45+00:00" title="June 21, 2010  4:48PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "A series on <i>Dirty Secrets</i>"? So there will be more? Because that would be totally cool!<br><br>Anyways, a comment or two.<br><br>First, I was glad to hear that Laura does enjoy playing <i>Dirty Secrets</i>, even if the "murder bingo" puts her off. If she's <b>really</b> interested, I'd recommend checking out either <i>The Goodbye Look</i> or <i>The Far Side of the Dollar</i>, both by Ross MacDonald. Those novels perhaps best capture the impact of "murder bingo" in the genre, especially the whole "apparently minor character is guilty of all sorts of things" aspect. Also, <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=25840.0" rel="nofollow">this AP thread at the Forge</a> is a good example of the central character being innocent of all the Crimes and yet fundamentally guilty.<br><br>And yeah, I've often said that <i>Dirty Secrets</i> isn't really about solving the Crimes. Instead, I use the analogy of a pearl being formed in an oyster. The Crimes are the grain of sand that we put into the group, and then the group starts wrapping layers of story around those grains. In this way, all kinds of people are implicated, and their <i>other</i> dirty deeds come to light.<br><br>This is the fundamental reason for the rule on children. In a way, I was trying to hard-code a particular potential Line into the game. For the record, I tend to side with Jesse on "Lines and Veils" conversations; in other words, I don't like them very much. I'd rather establish an environment where players can be open with addressing their concerns in the moment where a Line or Veil is breached. However, for <i>Dirty Secrets</i>, I wanted to make certain mechanical results off-limits for tampering. You know, once the dice are rolled, they count. I also figured out that Characters are significant players in the unfolding plot, and because of both Revelations and the Crime Grid, any Character is potentially dirty...sometimes <i>really</i> dirty. So, yeah, a child murderer, or a child being sexually molested, or even a child using sex to manipulate an older man. And those sorts of results are largely produced through random means, <i>not</i> through specific player choices that are subject to Appeal. As such, I wanted to make sure that there was a mechanical option to eliminate these possibilities.<br><br>The other way to address the issue without house-rules is to allow children but Appeal the introduction of any child under a certain age. This is totally legal by the rules as written, though it would probably benefit from a discussion up front, which I think is pretty funny, given my stance on "Lines and Veils" conversations. But there you go.<br><br>As far as the investigator being the PC or the GM, I think that this ends up being largely the result of what you bring to the game. The original reason I designed <i>Dirty Secrets</i> with that particular divide was to provide a role for my wife Crystal to play without requiring her to do a lot of character swapping. She'd rather connect to a single character, and I'm so used to being the GM that I like being puppetmaster for several characters. <i>Dirty Secrets</i> lets us both be happy!<br><br>I do agree that the ideal is to have a strong player as the investigator. This is also why I recommend having the investigator be someone who is familiar with the genre. Oddly, though, the player doesn't have to be very good at Liar's Dice. I've seen games where the investigator was constantly winning in conflicts and others where he was the whipping boy of the fiction. Both work surprisingly well.<br><br>Anyways, I'm glad that you're enjoying my game, and I look forward to hearing further comment, if it is available.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277185/#Comment_277185" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T19:39:37+00:00" title="June 21, 2010  7:39PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, I actually *like* the term Murder Bingo.

Perhaps for a con game.<br/><br/>Half of me feels that Laura would benefit from a bit more exposure to some classic noir fiction and films but the other half feels like she has a strong point of concern.  On the one hand, I get the idea that the lackey is basically the fall guy who is responsible for the actual act, which does nothing to diminish the moral failings of the real baddie who is orchestrating everything.  On the other hand, if you are spending a lot of the in-game fiction--oh no wait, now I think I've lost the other hand.  Because if I remember correctly, you did spend most of the in-game fiction dealing with the real baddie and her machinations.  So in effect, her lackey was just the trigger man.  Hmm, it's just that when Laura was explaining it, I was kind of nodding along and saying yeah to myself.  But now I'm not so sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277528">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277528/#Comment_277528" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-23T12:01:44+00:00" title="June 23, 2010 12:01PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So when Ron first wrote "System Matters" it was controversial because most people don't see a big difference between 1d20 + Modifiers &gt; TN and d10 pool count successes over 6.  And that's because they're looking too small.  The more accurate term is "Process Matters."<br/><br/>When the token lands on a name there's a process that kicks in.  You have to match the name with an unsolved crime and you have to justify it to yourself.  I have never found this to be a particularly difficult thing to do.  Nor have I found the "leap" you have to make particularly far.  However, no matter how easy or small the leap you still have to do it.  It's part of the process.  I think Laura doesn't enjoy that as a process.  It isn't really about the fiction content or the genre, it's about the activity.  It's simply a hassle to have to do that.<br/><br/>I recently discovered my own hiccup in the game.  I have always been a little disappointed that Dirty Secrets doesn't reliably generate violence in the conflicts.  I recently discovered that actually it's quite easy to "game" the violence mechanics.  However, you have to be willing to lose the conflict.  That clashes a bit with my preference that when I'm "speaking" for a character I'm honestly trying to serve his agenda.  The lack of violence in my past games has been due to me as an Authority always trying to serve the interests of the NPCs.  So the process of generating violence in Dirty Secrets is a little incongruous with how I relate to characters in the fiction I'm responsible for<br/><br/>So yeah, I don't think it's about genre or fiction content at all.  It's about process.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277546/#Comment_277546" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-23T12:47:35+00:00" title="June 23, 2010 12:47PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>When the token lands on a name there's a process that kicks in.

I had a Twitter conversation a week or two ago with a bunch of people about it.<br/><br/>That "leap" thing is one of my favorite things to do in roleplaying games, in all kinds of ways. I want to design it <i>in</i> to my games. I love how largely- or utterly-random events can happen that require you to take a moment and fit it in to the in-the-moment fiction, or your plan for the session, or the very foundational elements of your character.<br/><br/>The moment where I first became aware of this was in a con game of Vincent Baker's <i><a href="http://www.lumpley.com/dogsources.html" rel="nofollow">Dogs in the Vineyard</a></i>. I think <a href="http://githyankidiaspora.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Judd Karlman</a> was GMing. Anyway, I was in a just-talking conflict, and I'd run out of dice and any way to generate new ones without fighting \u2014 which I wouldn't have done at the time.<br/><br/>Anyway, Judd told me that I was out, and I got really angry and frustrated about it. I argued with him that I had no idea how to get him out of the fight in a believable way. Judd said something along the lines of, "Well, you have to figure out how. Make it work."<br/><br/>That "make it work" thing was hard for me at first, but I eventually began to seek it out avidly.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Another question: <br/><br/>Any chance that the dissatisfaction with the game had to do with the fact that no one knows how the mystery plays out, forever? There's no hidden answer until the end. I remember a fan of mystery stories saying that they had to "play fair." That is, there had to be something to solve, and solve fairly. That the readers of these books were almost taking them as games, and that that figuring out part was one of the big draws.<br/><br/>This game doesn't have that. Is there some simulation-bias \u2014 for lack of a better term \u2014 at work here? Does knowing that no one has a plan for where it's going ruin the mystery attraction?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277549/#Comment_277549" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-23T12:57:09+00:00" title="June 23, 2010 12:57PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob,<br/><br/>In case it isn't clear Will and I both really love this game.  I'll draw your question to Laura's attention so she can elaborate further.<br/><br/>I will say this though: I used to to really not like noir-style detective fiction because you couldn't figure it out.  An Agatha Christie novel has a puzzle component to it that a Dashiell Hammett novel does not.  I wasn't exactly sure what the value in watching some guy walk from place to place asking a lot of questions were if you didn't have a chapter break where all the clues were laid out and you could put the book down for a few hours and ponder it.<br/><br/>I think it was Ron (it usually it is for me) who pointed out the difference between a Mystery story and a Detective story.  A mystery story is about the puzzle.  A detective story is about the person/people.  Once I stopped looking for clues and started looking at how the detective related to all the people in the story.

Not this one.<br/><br/>I LIKE Lines and Veils as a social concept to be aware and mindful of.  What I don't like is upfront, explicit discussion of Lines and Veils that a lot of post-Sex &amp; Sorcery games advocate.  The reason is because I don't think people are very good at articulating their Lines.  They have general ideas about "uncomfortable" material but what would actually constitute a violation of a personal line I don't think anyone truly knows until after it happens.<br/><br/>So I'm of the opinion that upfront explicit Line talk doesn't create Lines at all.  It creates fictional TRENCHES.  It guts whole swaths of what may actually be interesting and acceptable material in favor of "safe" territory.  In order to avoid crossing a line you don't even go anywhere NEAR it.<br/><br/>I think it's more creatively productive if instead the group is *mindful* of lines and watches for social cues for when one has been crossed.  That mindfulness includes a willingness to apologize, back up and go in a different direction.<br/><br/>In some ways when it comes to Lines and Veils, I'd rather ask for forgiveness than permission.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277617">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277617/#Comment_277617" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-23T20:32:25+00:00" title="June 23, 2010  8:32PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>I LIKE Lines and Veils as a social concept to be aware and mindful of.
