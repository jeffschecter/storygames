This is not a value-judgement of good vs. bad on either side of the aisle here. I am not holding up the extant industry as a shining beacon of much of anything, but there's one major thing it has that the indie/small-press movement doesn't: <b>age</b>.<br/><br/>Elsethread, someone (please shout out who this was!) mentioned that the indie gaming movement's in its adolescence. I'd say that statement is spot-on.<br/><br/>The extant industry is in late adulthood, possibly even middle age. Many of the problems cited in these threads came up for the extant industry companies back in the late 70s, throughout the 80s, and even 90s. (One can debate how successfully they've met these challenges, of course.)<br/><br/>There are lessons to be learned from dealing with a more mature/established publishing structure. There are also lessons to be ignored. Engaging with the extant industry is a valuable experience.<br/><br/>At least, I've found it so in my game writing/design career, covering everything from how to work with editors and developers (as a freelancer and as a publisher), how to administer playtests via the internet, how to find art and artists, and so forth.<br/><br/>(I'd also say that my interactions in the indie/small press field are continuing to teach me a bunch of things about sharpening creative vision, <i>personally</i> running small playtests, methods of publishing, and methods of promotion.) <br/><br/>I'd frankly recommend everyone try to do some freelance work for an established company whose products you like. Heck, there are a number of indie/small press companies today that give a very trad/extant working experience. <br/><br/>It can be eye-opening.<br/><br/>CU                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129085/#Comment_129085" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T09:25:43+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  9:25AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nerdrage <i>activated!</i><br/><br/>It was Jonathan Walton who used the adolescence metaphor, Chad.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129086/#Comment_129086" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T09:26:09+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  9:26AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chadu</cite>I'd frankly recommend everyone try to do some freelance work for an established company whose products you like.</blockquote>\nYou're probably right.

I'll talk about my experience and leave the judgment to you.<br/><br/>I've contributed to three Ars Magica books. I'll be clear up front: you don't do this for the money. All of the Ars books are written by people who are fans first, writers second. The pay right now for these books is 2.5 cents a word (up from 2 cents when I started). <br/><br/>The first book I contributed to involved an open call. David Chart, the Ars Magica Line Editor, was looking to bring some new authors into his pool, so he put out a call for vis sources. These were extremely short (100-200 words) descriptions of sources of magical power. I thought it would be fun, so I wrote one a day for each of the 15 vis types. I submitted them, and David printed nine of them (I think) in the Covenants book. I got paid, but not much.<br/><br/>After that, David asked me (and several other authors) to join his solicitation list. Four times a year, he sends out a request for proposals for the next book in the line. Unlike previous editors for the game, David has a specific book in mind, often with an outline (with wordcounts) already attached. The next book that I contributed to was an anthology book, where each chapter was written by a different author and riffed on a particular theme. (Ancient Magic, if anyone cares. I wrote the Grigori chapter.) David called for chapter proposals, I submitted one, and he accepted it. I think I wrote 3000 words for it.<br/><br/>The last book was a more usual situation for the line, which is to say that David sent out a request for proposals, and a group of authors teamed up to write a proposal. I think we had eight authors on the Normandy book. I wrote about 9000 words for that one, including half of one covenant, all of another, and a chapter on Arthuriana in the 13th century.<br/><br/>All told, I made a few hundred dollars. I wrote some material that was very specific to that particular game, so the fact that I don't own it doesn't particularly bother me, as I couldn't very well republish it anyway. I learned a lot about myself as a writer (externally imposed deadlines to that to you), I learned how to collaborate with other writers, I learned how to deal with playtest feedback (Ars books go through two rounds of external playtest), and I learned how to work with an editor (though David has a lighter hand than most). I wouldn't say I got royally screwed at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129152/#Comment_129152" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T11:08:17+00:00" title="February 22, 2008 11:08AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2008 11:08AM by Brand_Robins.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Edit: I know, I know.

Go into it with your eyes open and knowing what it is you want, and you stand a good chance of getting it. <br/><br/>For example, if what you want is to learn something of the internal processes of a company, then you'll want to go with a company that has such things. Like, White Wolf or Wizards or another company that isn't just one guy. If you're doing it to learn about things like editing and customer focus, then you'll want to make sure you go with a company where developers talk about that with freelancers. (Again, White Wolf devs have been good to me about this. Most other companies not so much.) <br/><br/>If you want to get some publication credits, or make a little money and have some fun, then you're still good. Just make sure the company you're going for has a decent reputation and doesn't seem set to collapse into the ocean. If you want to make lots of money... well, you won't. If you want to make more money than you'd make doing your own game, that's going to depend on a lot of factors. For example, I made more money freelancing one year than Vincent and Matt Wilson made on Dogs or PTA, but the next year I made nothing while they kept making money. It isn't worth it to Sorenson to write for White Wolf, but it might be worth it for someone whose 25,000 word book only sells 50 copies.<br/><br/>Mostly, though, I'd give the same advice that folks like Vincent give to folks looking to publish their own book -- don't put anything into it you can't walk away from, know why you want to do it and what your payoff is, and keep those in mind at all times. <br/><br/>As to the whole idea of the OP... I'm kinda so so. There are things that I learned via freelancing for mainstream companies. Good lessons. I'm not sure all of them would directly apply to indie publishing. I'm not sure I couldn't have learned them another way. I think, for example, that the Indie community has done a pretty poor job of asking mainstream publishers for information without the whole thing turning into a mud slinging shit storm. Many of these folks are more than willing to talk, right up until the point where we start telling them they don't know what they're doing and are dinosaurs. I can't imagine why they'd get defensive at that, but they do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129155/#Comment_129155" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T11:10:44+00:00" title="February 22, 2008 11:10AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Nerdrage<i>activated!</i><br/><br/>It was Jonathan Walton who used the adolescence metaphor, Chad.</blockquote>\nMerci beaucoups, Jason.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129176/#Comment_129176" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T11:25:46+00:00" title="February 22, 2008 11:25AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Nerdrage<i>activated!</i></blockquote>\nFeel free to make use of the following in these situations:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://story-games.com/goodies/meme/nerdrage.gif"/><br/><br/>Now, not to derail things, here's my contribution. Go ahead and scroll up so that the pic falls off the page and is not distracting.<br/><br/>I agree with Chad on the age thing.  Old mainstream games: For every AD&amp;D 1e there were three stapled-together pieces of shit. I think in 10 years from now, people will still be playing (every now and again) some Dogs in the Vineyard, but would probably pull out a Sorcerer or The Mountain Witch or whatever in the same spirit that Mike Holmes threw down a "Nostalgia and LULZ" session of The Fantasy Trip at GenCon ("Ha ha, remember this? Yeah! Ho, boy"). I'm wondering what the future will bring, but very passively.<br/><br/>Also, I wrote several articles about roleplaying games and the scene in Japan, one for free (ptgptb.org), several for pay (Viz's comic release of the BASTARD!! manga: Shitty manga, BTW, but the Viz editor was a swell, awesome dude). It was really interesting to write what you know and love, for basically scratch (beer money; actually I think I saved up all that money and bought a PC monitor), with all sorts of limitations and constrictions. It's certainly not a must, but it can be an interesting experience.<br/><br/>And especially for contributing to games you love. I honestly wish I had an "idea" so that I could make a supplement pitch for Spirit of the Century. When shit settles a bit, I'm going to try to contribute more to games I like. Whether paid or not (ie "TSOY supplement"). It's another way to get into the Production of Stuff, without having to go and force yourself to make it about inventing all new games.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129179/#Comment_129179" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T11:27:03+00:00" title="February 22, 2008 11:27AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Apparently my contribution to indie roleplaying consists of assigning names to eras, like "diaspora" and "adolescence."</blockquote>\nYou're our very own Gibbon!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Chad, is there a way that indie designers could gain experience in this way and yet make sure they won't be royally screwed?

The way you find out about this is by talking to other freelancers (email, messageboard, maillinglist, blog, in person, etc.).<br/><br/>For my part, I had very pleasant working experiences with Atlas Games and Sword &amp; Sorcery, and an extensive working relationship with Steve Jackson Games. They all paid, on-time and well. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>I remember Jared once saying that is was cool to contribute to the Vampire Chronicler's Guide, but what he got paid (and the fact that he didn't own his creative work afterwards) made it not really worth the time and effort that he put into it.

SRSLY.<br/><br/>It teaches you a bunch of stuff:<br/><br/>* Watching the "actual owner" protects/controls/expands it help you learn IP husbandry.<br/><br/>* When it's going to end up someone else's material at the end of the day, they are more interested in you getting it right (for them) and give you more comments.<br/><br/>* If the editor/line developer tells you to change something (and you can't immediately change their mind), bollocks to your vision -- you either change the text, have it changed for you, walk from the project, or get booted. <i>This</i> is how you learn to take criticism, editorial advice, and how to put it into action, IMAO. (I've changed, had changed, and walked from projects.

The lessons learned working for bigger publishers were extremely useful to my self-publishing efforts.<br/><br/>And then look again: I'm freelancing for Evil Hat on <i>Dresden Files</i> right now.

I'm kinda so so. There are things that I learned via freelancing for mainstream companies. Good lessons. I'm not sure all of them would directly apply to indie publishing. I'm not sure I couldn't have learned them another way. I think, for example, that the Indie community has done a pretty poor job of asking mainstream publishers for information without the whole thing turning into a mud slinging shit storm. Many of these folks are more than willing to talk, right up until the point where we start telling them they don't know what they're doing and are dinosaurs.

You never know things about your own writing until someone points them out and says "Brand, you are better than this. Stop being fucking lazy." <br/><br/>I sometimes think you must hate a good editor a little when you're in the middle of a project, and love them afterwards. <br/><br/>Jonathan, <br/><br/>Depends on who you are. Some small companies will take walk ins with a portfolio, or without if they know you from the fan community. Really, I got in at Dream Pod 9 because of my activity on the mailing list, and at White Wolf because I was on a wrestling fan site with Justin. Networking is always important. <br/><br/>Past that, I think a lot of folks might be surprised. Push shows some shit as far as I'm concerned, and someone like you could probably use that to get a foot in the door. Anyone who contributed to it as well. Hell, releasing free games that get even a little good buzz and then showing them to folks who work at mainstream companies can probably get them to give you a shot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129196/#Comment_129196" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T11:40:30+00:00" title="February 22, 2008 11:40AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>Awesome.

(Actually, I guess some people could be born with industry-- sorry games-lawyering).<br/><br/>My first freelance sale was an article to Pyramid Online. They still take article submissions. They are NOT an SJG house organ; they'll publish an article on just about any game you can think of, and pay you for it.<br/><br/>(Before that, I was making bigass posts on the GURPS mailling list and throwing up campaign info on my webpage. This was back in the days before blogging-qua-blogging.)<br/><br/>Today, I'd participate in mailling lists for games you like, post thoughtful/new stuff on your blog, participate in playtests, write and submit a couple articles for paying venues, and keep a running CV of your work. Answer open calls. Make column or sourcebook pitches.<br/><br/>If you're coming from the indie games end of the pool, it doesn't matter: all your playtesting and writing and publishing info (mainstream industry, indie industry, real world industry, etc.) should be on that CV.

Given the low budgets of self-publishing, we can't afford to hire editors or writers, so it's do-it-yourself. You can learn these skills from many places -- writing school, books, friends. Or you can make a barter trade with another small publisher and do each others editing for free.<br/><br/>To preserve creativity one wants to maintain some distance from the convential approachs -- so I would encourage any indie designer to gain their presentation skills outside the RPG field!
