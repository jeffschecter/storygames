So, I started this thread to avoid thread-jacking there.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>But... how much of this depends on the changes on the feedback circle? From "the players" to "the people on storygames"?<br/><br/>People who design for themselves and their play group don't make what they do public on the net. Whose who do, search for feedback, for encouragement, for something from other people.<br/><br/>But what people? For a while it seemed like the objective was a kind of outreach, to people even outside the "gamers" circle. Lately, it seems like the gauge of "success" isn't the sales, the money, and not even the fun of people playing the game: it's the lenght of the threads about the game on story-games.<br/><br/>[edit: I was answering to Matt's post<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=203846" rel="nofollow">THERE</a>]</blockquote>\nMoreno's asking fair and interesting questions.<br/><br/>First, I agree that the "what people?" question hasn't always been the same over time, generally. It hasn't even been the same for me, specifically, as a publisher or as a hobbyist. <br/><br/>Second, people who design for themselves and don't share it? We don't know about them. We can't really have anything to say about them at all. They're irrelevant for this thread, probably for this forum entirely.<br/><br/>The much tougher question is whether we're perceiving some kind of false popularity or success based largely on reaction on specific forums, like this one. That's a potentially thorny question. <br/><br/>Let me first say, I think John considers Lady Blackbird a homerun at this point already. And, I think he's got good reason to say as much. I don't speak for John. But, the several replies of praise coupled with the multiple reports of fun actual play are probably enough to make him smile all year long. <br/><br/>So, with that in mind, I think it's a bit snarky to say that the popularity of things is less genuine because it's "just" posts on Story Games. <br/><br/>HOWEVER! I do think you have a valuable point.<br/><br/>What is the purpose of publishing something (by which I mean making it available to others, usually online)?<br/><br/>Well, in the indie scene, there have traditionally been several goals. Some said it was to change the way the hobby was. Some said it was pure creative release. Some said they wanted to make a professional go of it by publishing. Some said they wanted other people to actually play the games. Etc. <br/><br/>When I published my games -- that is, sold them -- I would have agreed with a couple of those. I wanted other people to enjoy actual play of my games, and I wanted to change in some small contribution the way the hobby works. <br/><br/>Here's the thing I realized more recently. I realized very recently that I sought attention from others. <br/><br/>Now, that sounds very selfish and childish to many. I have no doubt that had someone suggested this was what I was after a couple years ago, I would have argued angrily with them. I would have claimed I was seeking something more "pure." <br/><br/>Bullshit. I wanted people to think I made cool stuff, and I wanted them to communicate that to me.<br/><br/>I actually don't think it's childish or selfish or "unpure." I probably could still say I wanted actual play to happen. But, if I didn't know about it, I still felt bad about my publishing. <br/><br/>It is among the handful of major reasons I ceased publishing. I'm not ashamed of that. I realized that the way in which I created cool stuff to share with others for recognition wasn't worth the effort for me. I think I simply worked way to hard for too little recognition.<br/><br/>I'll go out on a limb and say damn near everyone who publishes wants recognition like this. Might there be some pure soul out there seekign truly to "change things" or whatever? Maybe. But, I don't know anyone who doesn't love the idea of someone commenting on their games, or handing over $20 to say it's cool, or whatever other recognition.<br/><br/>So, honestly? Yep. Long posts on Story Games thrill creators. I see no problem. If someone seeks out recognition on SG (or somewhere else), especially by making something that's cool and playable, great! More power to them. I think the benefits for everyone outweigh any worries about doing something more sincere or whatever.<br/><br/>The problem I see is whether the social reward that creators receive actually leads them do something "wrong" FOR THEM AS CREATORS. That's possible. Maybe those SG threads encourage someone to sell games on Lulu and it turns out that's a disaster for them (for whatever reason -- doing taxes next year, let's say). But, I'm not willing to leap to the notion that it's somehow false praise or some such.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203978/#Comment_203978" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-28T17:59:11+00:00" title="April 28, 2009  5:59PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>Here's the thing I realized more recently.

I know I do.  I know Brand does (he's even sent me some of it, on request). And I imagine that's also true for a ton of other people.  I'm also not sure it's not relevant to this forum, because it surely affects the way we approach games.  I mean, "traditionally," GMs would all do minor and major design work and, before the internet, only share it with their local groups.  And that kind of thing still goes on all over the place and, even with the internet, a lot of it isn't shared.  In many ways, Ghost/Echo, Lady Blackbird, and other stuff simply represents the indie community beginning to share this kind of design work with each other (as several folks have said, "module design" instead of fully stand-alone games).<br/><br/>So, rather than this "secret design" work being irrelevant to this forum, I think what we're seeing is that it's suddenly becoming relevant because it's suddenly being shared, whereas, before, other forms of design work (stand-alone games in various states of completion, contest games, etc.) were predominant or even the norm (what was appreciated the most and expected for people to share).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204005/#Comment_204005" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-28T19:42:17+00:00" title="April 28, 2009  7:42PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2009 7:43PM by John_Harper.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like praise and recognition (like the rest of you filthy humans). When people say nice things about my work, it makes me smile, usually a lot. When something I make catches fire and gets lots of attention, I feel pride.<br/><br/>But, as someone who makes his living being creative, I learned long ago that doing creative work <i>for the purpose</i> of getting praise and recognition is a terrible, terrible thing. Because what if you don't get it? Where does that leave you? Creating something to "get noticed" or (the worst) "so people will like you" is a very bad idea.<br/><br/>The only person I create for is me. I make stuff because I want to make it, I enjoy making it, and I have the means to make it. Full stop. Everything that comes after that is nice and happy-making, but that's all. If other people don't like it, that's okay. Because I made it for me and I enjoyed making it -- or, in the case of professional work, I got paid for it. Like it, don't like it, whatever. That's all tangential to the work.<br/><br/>And there's another component to this, which is: why am I here, sharing creative work in the form of RPG stuff, instead of on some other forum sharing with other people? Because I love this hobby and I want to support it however I can. The best tools I have are words, pictures, layout, and game design, so I do that.<br/><br/>What I care about most in this hobby is playing games and talking about what happens when we play. By making game stuff that inspires other people to play games and talk about it, I can fulfill my own wish for that aspect of the hobby. It sure beats standing on a corner and whining about it. "C'mon everyone! Play more! And post about it! Please?" There's a whole lot of whining about how things "should be" in this hobby (especially on the Internet). I decided a while back to try not to add to that noise but to turn that energy to making stuff instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204010/#Comment_204010" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-28T19:59:20+00:00" title="April 28, 2009  7:59PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with John entirely and want to add to it.<br/><br/>Before anyone sees or hears something I contribute to, be it a book or a podcast or a post on a forum, I'm pretty excited about it and proud of how it turned out.

Which means, of course, that I have the answer to everything for everyone, in case you were wondering.<br/><br/>Anyway, for me it seems to be a sort of hero quest thing. I like to go out into the unknown, find nuggets of gold and bring them back to my tribe. Then I want my tribe to go "whooo, that's incredibly cool and useful" and applaud me as a hero. This is pretty much what happened when I wrote my first game, "Draug". The very best experience from that whole process was, without a doubt, when I was standing in front of a room full of gamers at Arcon, telling them about my game, and receiving a long and heartfelt applause afterwards. <br/><br/>There were other forms of reward; in descending order of importance: Hearing that people played/ran the scenarios and liked them; my mom and uncles and aunts finally starting to understand that this was something serious and worthwhile; getting my face in the papers; money. (And, later, the understanding that having one book published opens a lot of doors, mentally and writing-career-wise). However, nothing beats coming back to my tribe - the gamers at Arcon - and receiving their acknowledgment that I had done a Good Thing.<br/><br/>So, for me, it depends who my tribe is for a given project. And I think that the internet is a substitute tribe, a poor substitute that I go to when I think it can give me more instant recognition. Making a game accessible and useful and interesting to my tribe of gamers takes a lot of time. Putting a file up on the internet is a hit-and-miss thing, but if you're lucky, you get threads at SG where cool people say stuff about your game. But the warm, fuzzy feeling I get when my friends actually want to play my game and enjoy it is unbeatable.<br/><br/>(Which is, in fact, hurtful for my game design in the early stages of the process. For some reason, early recognition often means no finished game. Especially if I haven't tried the game yet myself. I'm not entirely sure why that is. I think it has something to do with unformed ideas having to gel in a safe, dark place, either in the designer's head or in a closed team of designers; creating things in a dialogue with the world doesn't seem to work well for me. Vonnegut's rules for short stories, #7: "Write to please just one person.

I don't just want it to look pretty or sound cool, I want it to <i>work</i>.  I'm willing to put effort into that, and I enjoy it, but it's harder to enjoy when I <i>can't tell</i> if it works, because no one's playing it.  So, a certain amount of attention is really essential.  <br/><br/>Once I'm sure the game works, however much attention and praise I get after that point is a pure bonus.  (A hoped-for bonus to be sure!  Just not as <i>important</i> as making a game that works.) <br/><br/>Hypothetically, I guess if I got a ton of attention for ashcans, finished the game, and then no one bought or played it, I'd be let down.<br/><br/>Finally, there's the place of attention and praise in the quest for sales, which is its own project.  Obviously fun for some, not for others.  Not sure yet where I'll fall.  "How much money can I make off this thing I made?" sounds kind of bland but holds some challenge appeal, while, "How well can I communicate what my game offers?" is more compelling.<br/><br/>One thing that seems clear to me is that this corner of the internet is too saturated with designers/publishers/smart folks who talk a good game/players who've played ten billion RPGs/etc. to really be dazzled by anything I churn out.  Simple friendly congrats from the people I know, in the vein of, "Kudos for finishing your project!" will suffice just fine.  Although I will probably cringe a bit when someone calls it garbage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204039/#Comment_204039" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T01:06:00+00:00" title="April 29, 2009  1:06AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>First, Matt Snyder has nailed an aspect of my desires with this whole publishing thing.</p>\n<p>I've always looked at it on the negative side, though. It's always felt like a weakness that I crave the approval of people on my creative endeavors. My personal life, not so much. If you don't approve of me, who I am or the choices I make, t'hell with you. But I create because I want to share. Attention to and response to my creations validates that what I want to share has value to someone other than me. This by itself isn't a weakness. The fact that I let the frequently resounding silence discourage me is.</p>\n<p>I've been a member of the indie and small-press roleplaying games community for about 8 years. The entire time, I've styled myself a designer. I do not yet name myself published, because while my work may meet some definitions of published, it does not meet mine. I frequently doubt whether anyone takes me seriously as a designer because it's been the better part of a decade of talk without results.</p>\n<p>John has another aspect on the nose, as well.</p>\n<p>I create because I can't not. I am an amateur programmer, digital artist, writer, layout guy, rpg designer, board game designer and poet. I've toyed with leather-working in the past, I've even done some sewing. Other than playing video games and reading, I don't think I have a single hobby that doesn't involve creating.. Even then, I tend to prefer video games that allow for creation of things, (one reason why Spore was so fascinating to me).</p>\n<p>If I languish away in obscurity for the rest of my days, I will still continue to create. I will still continue to share. While I may let ReCoil and Rats in the Walls and Mage Blade languish for months or years at a time, I will always return to them eventually..

As you seem to say above, the rewards that come with Recognition are scant compared to the effort involved.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>I'll go out on a limb and say damn near everyone who publishes wants recognition like this. Might there be some pure soul out there seekign truly to "change things" or whatever? Maybe. But, I don't know anyone who doesn't love the idea of someone commenting on their games, or handing over $20 to say it's cool, or whatever other recognition.</blockquote>Well, I don't really relate to this.<br/><br/>Just about all of the RPG stuff that I design or write is based on my desire to <i>run</i> that kind of game or setting. I get value out of actually running the game; out of seeing that it works in play as well or better than it did in my head; and from the enjoyment of people who are playing the game (even at conventions, these people are often old friends or acquaintances of mine). When I was younger I went through a phase of wanting recognition from strangers out there in the world, so I'd throw things on GeoCities or put huge amounts of work into projects that I never actually used myself. But I got over that pretty fast, because being highly regarded on a mailing list, or even getting complimentary emails from designers like Steve Kenson or Tracy Hickman, simply isn't as rewarding as my friend Rhi saying "I always play your games".<br/><br/>I'm currently toying with the idea of PDF or POD publishing Radiance, which is a SF RPG that I put together so there would be at least <i>one</i> SF game in the world that matches my preferences and I would be happy to run. Currently I use it at conventions, and some of my players have asked "Do you plan to make this available sometime?" Right now my feeling is that if getting Radiance to a publishable form would be a natural extension of what I'm already doing, and not detract from my other gaming activities, then I'd put in the extra effort. But not if this would jeopardise my real gaming in any way.<br/><br/>The money alone is certainly not worth it. <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/> I could just ask to take a four-hour Saturday shift twice a month and make scads of cash compared to what PDF publishing is likely to net me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204046/#Comment_204046" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T02:48:13+00:00" title="April 29, 2009  2:48AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite> Attention to and response to my creations validates that what I want to share has value to someone other than me.

If we don't want recognition, we may create and not share (though it's something of an issue with RPGs, is a game a game if it's not played?). I think we all want, and perhaps need the recognition, the question is what happens when we don't get it.<br/><br/>I apply different standards to different venues. When I create a facebook status, I usually don't care one whit if others see it. I publish it for myself, and that others see it is accidental. Some things which I create, I now know I <i>need</i> the feedback - but Matt has it right in a different way, when I set out to do it I didn't think I did it for that, but later when I tried to see what was stopping me from moving forward, what led to the burn-out feeling, that's what I've uncovered.<br/><br/>My (personal) blog is a happy medium - I really needed some posts to get looked at, but I created even when it didn't happen, and reading old posts I didn't remember writing was worth it all, in retrospect. It's like getting messages from the me in the past. The need to share is temporary, but the smile I get from seeing what I've made before can happen a long time after the recognition yearning stops. But these aren't games.<br/><br/>Even now, if I work on something game-related the recognition is not what I do it <i>for</i>, but it's something I recognize as necessary for me to keep my work on something sustained. Feeding into the new playsets - you don't need to keep work on it sustained. You put work into it, and it's <b>done</b>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204156/#Comment_204156" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T09:44:48+00:00" title="April 29, 2009  9:44AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do a fair amount of design work that people never see.

Points here are well and good, but perhaps a bit misleading in context with my original post. <br/><br/><br/>First off, I agree with John Harper that creating stuff <i>strictly and exclusively</i> for the point of seeking praise is weird. That's not my point.<br/><br/>Secondly, I also agree with multiple people that many people have an urge to create stuff, and that we'll do it shared or otherwise. I do that all the time! But, it's <i>distinct</i> in my experience from also seeking recognition for things created. Sometimes we share creations, sometimes we don't. It doesn't "disprove" the need for recognition like I'm talking about. <br/><br/>Third, I think it's pretty clear that at least among my pals of the indie scene (Forge pals, etc.), the notion that you do things to seek social recognition is Bad. You should create games for their own sake, or seek to improve gaming, and so on. Many noble intentions.<br/><br/>I'm not saying those things don't exist. They do. I earnestly did want people to actually play functional, innovative games and have fun, no recognition needed.<br/><br/>However, despite those things existing, I certainly perceived (and I think others did too) that "seeking validation" or whatever we call it was taboo. It was phony and impure and so on. I see this as a mistake, looking back.<br/><br/>Finally, to be totally clear -- I did not appreciate how true this was of me until I ceased publishing and receiving recognition. I sensed recognition waning prior to me ceasing publication. But, once I really did cease and the chatter went away completely, it truly sunk it. I'll be damned, I thought! I never realized how important that social recognition was to me, and important it was to my life that friends and colleagues shared their respect with me, until it was gone!

It was seen as sort of immature. That the creator was just an attention hound and not "real." And, also, therefore not contributing like he or she "should" to make the scene/hobby better.<br/><br/>Make no mistake. I'm not casting stones lightly. I participated in this.

I wonder if there's any truth in that.<br/><br/>In theory, if I was making a game to impress people and get praise, I'd probably try to tap into whatever was popular at the moment among the most vocal members of the community.  If that happened to be something I wasn't particularly good at, I could see a bad game resulting... and if someone were to say to me, "Dave, your time would be better spent on something you have a real affinity and passion for," that might make some sense.<br/><br/>But that still doesn't get us all the way to "bad for an audience".  To achieve that, I guess the creator would have to be tricking people into buying and playing their game with false advertising or some such.  Was that ever a major concern?<br/><br/>Or maybe the complaints originated from folks who didn't want to lose part of the spotlight they already had, thus the fewer games tossed out into the collective consciousness the better?  I could see some resentment...

And I mean piles of the nature that my family wouldn't have to work for generations. That said, a couple things of note.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) I might be able to make those scads of money in some other industry more easily. Maybe, but I doubt it. This industry is ripe full of potential for the ambitious and determined.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Its an awful lot easier to put in 10-14 hour work days all the time when the thing you are doing, you enjoy doing. Its awfully impossible to keep up that sort of work commitment long term unless you really enjoy the work.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Recieving lots of attention and recognition for your work is NOT a bad thing. As long as you can avoid acting like a utter fool in the work/creative/publishing process undertaken to get that recognition. Heck, that recognition can help open doors and create opportunities and can tie back into that attempting to make scads of money. Failing the making of scads of money, that recognition can let you meet lots of folks you might not otherwise get the opportunity to meet and lots of good can come from said meetings, both personally and professioanlly.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Recognition upon itself is not a path to anywhere or anything. Might give you a few worm tingling feelings when you are new to it all, but that wears thin after time. Hopefully there is something else for an individual to obtain from that process or achieving it will begin to feel fairly hollow in the end.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Yes, besides the want to make scads of money, it is possible for folks to _also_ be operating out of a desire to "change things". I could have certainly just kept on pushing GOB Publishing forward if I had wanted, but the operations of GOB Publishing alone only had me on a path towards those scads of money. But I also want to affect change and realized I needed a different vehicle with a totally different business plan to get started at that. Hence why we started GOB Retail.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking scads of money is not bad<br/>\nMaking changes to the industry is usually not bad.<br/>\nRecieving recognition from other for your accomplishments also not bad.<br/>\nParlaying that recognition back into scads of money or the power to enact change is kind of cool<br/>\nLetting the social interactions enabled by the recieving of recognition within a community kind of cool tool.<br/>\n<br/>\nMixing any and all of the above in any combination = not bad.<br/>\nHaving fun along the way though = important too.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecognition purely and solely for the sake of recognition...Likely a bit empty. But hey, for some folks, that might be leading to social engagement not found elsewhere in their lives. So probably not our place to judge.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

Let's assume for the moment that there is some truth to it. That creating stuff so that the creator can gather praise actually does lead to some kind of worse design. That might actually be the case, although I'm sorta torn about it.<br/><br/>So what? Gasp! An indie RPG designer creates a game that isn't terribly well designed? Gee whiz, that's never happened before! <br/><br/>I think the argument was hubristic of us. First, it assumed that these instances were So Important They Mattered. That's silly. Second, it also assumed the community wasn't durable enough or smart enough to deal with it ok. Even more silly.<br/><br/>I take a more easy going stance these days. Sure, yes, I want excellence in my hobby, because I like cool games and cool people. But, complaining about the awfulness of things other people are creating is fucking stupid. Now, I have two approaches: 1) I should actually go out and help that person if I think I can. They're extremely unlikely to turn me down. To that extent, I'm still interested in mutualism.  2) I just keep on keepin' on, doing my thing. Why the hell should I even bother if someone isn't living up to my standards something? If I want excellence, I'll create myself or with pals because it's about all I can truly affect. I'm done evangelizing and crusading. I got tired. I don't think it much worked. Besides, I sounded like an obnoxious ass.<br/><br/>Look, another reason I stopped publishing was because despite significant progress the indie RPG community gained in 8 years or so, it remains a speck on the arse of a niche hobby. I love it dearly, but this is damn near buggy whip territory. Given that perspective, the amount of time and energy we spent beating each other up intellectually is now totally bizarre to me. My god, we actually had fights about this crap? We did. All while the world was changing in a million directions? What the fuck did all this arguing do to get, say, 2% growth among teen agers or college kids participating in role-playing, and help perpetuate the hobby? Nothing, as far as I can tell. Even if it did, the whole undertaking's so stunted and backwards such data literally doesn't even exist for anyone, anywhere. The amount of resources and expertise are non-existent! And, worse, we've got another current thread right now showing anecdotal evidence that the hardest of the hard core in this niche hobby view its biggest game (D&amp;D) as little more than a board game! JESUS CHRIST! What a joke! <br/><br/>And, so, all I can do is laugh and enjoy myself anymore. Why so serious? Indeed.<br/><br/>Finally, on your last paragraph, I have no idea if others were resenting newer voices that stole spotlight. Not much evidence of that, and I'm certainly not saying people did that. I think there were times I was resentful of publishers, but it was fleeting and not really related to the concept we're talking about here. It was, say, GenCon shelf space stuff. Not who got the longer SG thread or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204626/#Comment_204626" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T01:55:44+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  1:55AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An aside, I don't think it's a joke.<br/><br/>Also, the way I saw it, it wasn't about "Bad for customers", perhaps not even "Bad for the creator", that they did something for recognition.

But, it's mostly me being hyperbolic. I think the evidence is VERY anecdotal on this specific topic. It's not really enough to assume much of anything at all. <br/><br/>My point was like this: Given how much political gnashing and intellectual navel gazing we've done and seen in the indie world in 8 years, we have remarkably little to show for it. Yes, the movement identified itself and grew. But, even after its growth, it's still absurdly small and insignificant in the grand scheme of all things AND even in the grand scheme of Dungeons and Dragons as a market, for a closer-to-home example. <br/><br/>So, it seems to me wildly strange that even among people here on Story Games -- peole who are the probably the most hard core about role-playing as a unique act (imagining up narratives together as a group) -- view the Number 1 selling RPG as a board game! It's not even a RPG to us! Which means that, if that were true (again, I'm skeptical -- this is for the sake of argument for now), it's not even the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> RPG . It's a boardgame instead. So, we don't even have a Big Man On Our Campus. <br/><br/>If anything is likely to expand the hobby, it's the firepower of WotC and D&amp;D. Yet, here we are saying that it's not even really much of an RPG. That seems to crazy! <br/><br/>Let's imagine for the moment that it's correct -- that by and large D&amp;D 4E is mostly a tabletop board game, and that it's role-playing aspects are very fleeting. So, when 14-year-old joe comes along and plays it, what's he likelier to move to later on? Magic: The Gathering, World of Warcraft, or Burning Wheel? I think Burning Wheel loses to both the others, and not just because it's much smaller in presence and marketing than the other two. I'm saying that 14-year-old who enjoys 4E is likelier to enjoy Magic than he is Burning Wheel or PTA or whatever. Which means we haven't really "recruited" him into role-playing, which sucks. <br/><br/>Also, of course there is nothing definitional about 14-year-olds and college kids as the thing to recruit. Others still argue it's more like 30-year-old geek girlfriends. Fine. I don't see that happening <i>enough</i> either. We're still just a speck.<br/><br/>In short, I'm saying all this arguing and self-policing our community has done hasn't done much to help us overall. I'd rather spend my leisure time and energy NOT arguing about all this silliness, and NOT recruiting folks, and just enjoying my hobby as best I can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204692/#Comment_204692" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T08:13:50+00:00" title="May  1, 2009  8:13AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matt, I went through a very similar series of revelations, just a bit earlier I think, because I wasn't ever super-involved in publishing and had much less success at it (compared to, say, Dust Devils).  I think, in some ways, it's easier to see the bullshit from the outside, which is partially what people meant when they talked about the Forge or the indie design scene in general being hostile to outsiders.  It wasn't anything intentional, but more the negative sense of inter-designer competition and intellectual positioning and such that surrounded the scene (and still does, to some extent).  Folks are still often hostile to new or different ideas about design or play (frex: the debacle over Mo's "Push/Pull" terminology (which I helped perpetuate), Sage's fear that 2-page games will "take over" and become the entirety of the indie scene). Honestly, I think many folks have now turned their design/theory swords to plowshares, so to speak, and have begun channeling their frustration into productive, creative stuff, instead of fighting over minor differences in perspectives.  This is only going to be better for us in the long run, I think.  <br/><br/>I'm really, really excited that you feel like you've moved to a more comfortable place on this whole business, even if your earlier publishing model was a casualty of that transition (remember all the shit you got for that? again, such hostility to different perspectives).

Design something for yourself and for some other people who you think will dig it.  If it blows up, it does.  But there's a lot of trying to be "the next D&amp;D / Dogs in the Vineyard / BW / etc." that gets in the way of making good games and enjoying playing them.  So, in some ways, I think giving up on making a huge difference in the gaming community (or even outside the gaming community) is best.  Do what you do, y'know?

More specifically, I don't want to muddy the waters of this thread, and I don't feel like starting another thread myself. If one or the other of you wishes to do so, I'll gladly join in and share my thoughts, though.</p>\n<p>Matt, I think I understand now.. What you're saying is that the hobby may have lost its biggest draw if D&amp;D is moving away from being about roleplaying, which makes all of the fighting, self-policing, recruiting and such even sillier than it might otherwise have been, even had it been effective in the first place, right?</p>\n<p>So here's where we may disconnect. Y'see, I've never really cared about all of that. I believe there's this thing we call 'the hobby', I self-identify as both a gamer and a geek, and I feel an instantaneous sense of kinship with other gamers, no matter how little we actually have in common... But as far as I'm concerned, what is generally considered 'the hobby' can take care of itself. So long as I can find gamers (preferably those open to non-D&amp;D gaming, but I'll take what comes, usually) and I can get my game on and geek out about the hobby, I'm happy.</p>\n<p>What I care about is gamers I know, or at least know about. The theoretical masses of gamers that are outside my awareness are like your silent game designers, completely irrelevant to me. Before meeting you at GenCon, you were little more than a name I'd heard and a couple games I'd never played, but I was still excited to meet you, and potentially to game with you (completely aside from the fact that meeting you meant I had a place to stay for the Con), simply because you were a gamer that I was aware of. Maybe if we had gamed together, we'd have discovered that our styles and preferences were incompatible, but that's part of the point of discovery. As far as I'm concerned, the community of gamers, 'the hobby, is at best a few hundred people in size, and that's all I care about.</p>\n<p>This links back into recognition and validation. My goals aren't to have my game designs played by the nameless faceless masses. I want the gamers I'm aware of to pay attention to my designs, to play them, to buy them, to enjoy them, nitpick them and critique them. It's not that I don't <em>want</em> complete strangers to play my games.. It's just that I'm not invested in the idea. On the flip side, the idea that some 14-year-old Joe or 30-year-old geek girlfriend may play my game, then talk about it on the Forge, S-G, my personal forums, or any forum that impinges on my awareness is exciting to me.. At that moment, that gamer transforms from a non-entity to a gamer I know, enters 'the hobby', and gains importance to me. When it comes to expanding the hobby or recruiting, that's the only sort I care about.</p>\n<p>Of course, given your latter commentary, maybe we don't disconnect at all.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204784">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204784/#Comment_204784" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-01T12:13:42+00:00" title="May  1, 2009 12:13PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think we disconnect much, Lance.

Because what would get more attention than creating the thing that <i>will</i> be the Big Man on Campus?<br/><br/>If D&amp;D doesn't naturally feed any significant number of new people into indie roleplaying games - and while I sneer at the "not an RPG" argument, there is no clear evidence that it does - then there really is no leading RPG... which leaves the door open for someone to create one. I think a substantial faction of us want to make that perfect thing that's gonna be the new genre definer and create a new hobby rather than usurping the old. <br/><br/>Even if this is not a total pipe dream, it certainly isn't clear that arguing over it and trying to make it all artistically perfect is going to accomplish that. Getting serious about testing things, even flawed things, in a new, wider marketplace would be more productive. But then again, it'd be sporadically productive but mostly wasteful... just like arguing on SG.

So, I started this thread to avoid thread-jacking there.</blockquote>\nHi Matt!<br/><br/>First, thanks for the long and detailed reply. I did not answer it before because the thread was very interesting, and touched many more things than my initial post, and I didn't want to stop that.<br/><br/>Now it seems to have run its course, so it's time to try to explain better what I meant.<br/><br/>When John posted Lady Blackbird, I was impressed as many others from the quality of that simply 8-page document. But then, as post after post was posted in thread after thread about it, I felt a increasing sense of dissatisfaction. Not with Lady Blackbird: with the environment where it was released. At first I didn't understand what caused this, but your post made me realize that it was tied to some on my thoughts on story-game as a GAME DESIGN and ACTUAL PLAY DISCUSSION environment, derived from the usual annual polemic about "half-baked" game and critique (how much time we have left until the next one?)<br/><br/>Story games is in love with the shiny and new, with the latest fad, with the latest alpha draft of anything that seems "cool". It's in love with anything with Dungeon, Elves and Dragons in it, and with the games we played when we were younger. It's in love with being one of the "cool kids", and a lot of people read it to know "what they should play to be cool" exactly as some other people read Vogue to know that they should wear.<br/>By the other way, Story-games don't care a bit about anything depressing, difficult to play or to understand. You will not find a lot of love here for Spione, A Flower for Mara, or... Nine Worlds. (now there is a lot of interest for Montsegur, that it would seems to negate this. But there are a lot of "cool kids" now pushing it - and it's good that they do - let's see how much it will be discussed here when it will not be so new and the cool kids will push something different)<br/><br/>Most of all, Storygames don't care for anything that is "old". Some months ago it seemed like everybody was playing a beta version of "Red Box Hack". When, after some months, the project was shelfed and given, free, to anybody who wanted to continue it, I didn't see a tenth of that interest. "Red Box Hack? Old stuff. Been there, done that. Now the cool kids play Lady Blackbird"<br/><br/>This is not storygames' fault. It's what it is. Any attempt to make it more "serious", less playful, will ruin it. This _IS_ a cool bar where the cool kids (and their less cool friends) go to relax and talk shit.  The success of story-games demonstrate that there was a need for a place like this ("all work and no play make game designers dull boys...")<br/><br/>And, until some time ago, this was acknowledged. Even when this was not only the "forge lounge bar" anymore, the people who wanted to discuss game design were told that this was not the right place, that they would be better served to going to the Forge or any other game design forum/blog/community online.  It was very, very good advice. But it's not given anymore.  Now, it seems more and more that this is seen as a good environment for the "cutting edge" game design.<br/><br/>What this mean is, of course, a lot of alpha draft "published" as pdfs and then never seriously playtested or polished (but with a lot of nice color illustration! And no, I am talking about John's Work, I am talking about what a lot of people will see of his work, only). I am talking about some games that could become great games, if properly tested, prodded, changed, but they will never be. Because when the first draft was posted on story-games, everybody went "awesome!, and the game designer, being human, wanting that praise, don't want to change what other people are telling him is awesome, but after a while he find that he has really no fun playing his "awesome" game and shelf it forever.<br/><br/>What this mean, is that the social reward for game design, in this forum, is so fucking SHORT, that doesn't reward working a lot of time on anything.<br/><br/>What this mean is the story-games version of the White Wolf supplement treadmill. What this mean it's a memory so short-range that fucking GAMING MODULES are seen as the latest innovation of cutting edge game design.<br/><br/>What this mean, is having every year the same groaning, gnashing of teeth, and polemics, about the latest wave of poorly designed, quickly-published unplayable games full of misspellings and errata, in the same place that praise and encourage that kind of design.<br/><br/>And I am not talking only about game DESIGN. I am talking about game practice, too.  When I was a new indie-rpgs novice, having just discovered this land of many worders, afyer playing a lot of Dogs in the Vineyard, I wanted to try anything new: I want to be current, I wanted to know what the new cutting edge was, and I began to play a lot of rpgs. Once. Then I went to another shiny and new rpg, sure that in this way I would quickly become a better player. <br/><br/>It didn't happen. This really hurt my playing, instead. My gameplay become superficial, board-game-like. I played a lot of games without really understanding them. When I understood this, I stopped and rethought my objectives. And began to search for older designs, the classics (MLWM, Sorcerer, lately trollbabe) or these new games that were worked upon a lot until they were rock-solid (Spione, for example) and began to play them a lot. Discovering their more nuanced game-play and in this way, I think, becoming a better player.<br/><br/>(continue: the post was too long...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204904">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204904/#Comment_204904" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-02T09:42:29+00:00" title="May  2, 2009  9:42AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2009 9:49AM by Moreno R..">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continue from above)<br/><br/>I have NOTHING against wanting to be liked, to be praised, to be considered: it's human, and I am not convinced it's a bad thing. But if you are going to put a lot of yourself into something to get that praise... you should better search that praise where it will not vanish after some weeks because you are not "new" anymore.<br/><br/>I looked at the Forge "Actual play" forum just now.  Just in the first page there are threads about Shadows, 1001 nights, With Great Power, IAWA, Ninja Burger, Tunnel and Trolls, Liquid, Sorcerer, 7seas, Trollbabe, D&amp;D 1, Agon, Dogs in the Vineyard, Dead of Nights, and Drowning and Falling<br/><br/>Then I looked at the first page of Story-games:  it talks only of Lady Blackbird, D&amp;D4, a new hack of the Mountain Witch... the older game with a specific thread is Panty Explosion, and it's been months from the previous thread about that game.<br/><br/>I think that, even if it was negated or even looked down at the time, the desire to "look good" in the eyes of the "old forge hands", to be publicy praised by Ron, was a very strong push for quality and innovation and GOOD DESIGN. Rock-solid good design.<br/><br/>It was that design that, years later, caused me to go here.  If, instead of these games, I would have been handed a first draft of something that I could hack if I was a "cool kid"... I would have simply dropped it into the waste basket. I had already enough of games that required me to be an "good enough GM" to last a lifetime. <br/><br/>If I can ask a personal question, Matt...  your perception of not being rewarded enough for the time and work you did put into game design, was born before or after beginning to read story-games? Did you feel not rewarded enough when there was only the Forge?<br/><br/>P.S.: about the recognition, in general, of Forge innovations... Maybe that would merit a thread of his own.  I just returned, last week, from the best gaming convention of my life (Internoscon - there is a thread still on the first page of story-game). 71 persons took over entire hotel for two days, and had all the place and all the cooks and waiters for them while they played a lot of "dirty hippie games". 44 different dirty hippies games (the most traditional one was "Cat" by John Wick. Not a trace of anything from WW or WotC in sight).  There were so many people who wanted to go but were left out when the place was crammed full that next year we will go for two hotels and 200 places.  <br/><br/>Do you know a funny things? At least a dozen of these people were forge haters before the convention, and now they talk in their old forums as they were forge evangelists. More than half of the others people were against these game no more than a few months ago.  Two years ago, in Italy, I think there were no more than half a dozen of people online in Italy who even did know what these games.  It's like a Borg invasion: "resistance is futile, you'll be assimilated": when I meet a italian online who contest that these games are simply better, I don't try to convince him by arguing. I tell him "next time, at that convention, will you play this game with me?", and after the convention he is usually (almost always) a fervent supporter of that game. People online already joke about the pages of the translated manuals having been drenched with some willpower-destroying drug, and some "traditional" forum has closed the area of discussion of "other games" apart from the old ones in a futile try to stop the contagion.<br/><br/>A lot of this is because, simply, we all go to the same conventions and know each other. Italy is small. But by reading the american forums, I get the impression that a lot of separation is caused by (1) not having the right games at the start of the polemics to hand to people: the first Forge games required already knowing how to play them (exactly as the kind of design praised on story-games: a closed one for a closed group), (2) a much deeper separation in the culture of play: I am shocked to hear some tales from people who have seen some USA conventions about the...  total lack of any role-playing in many tables. Even D&amp;D players in Italy have a play-pretend attitude much more strong that any wargaming influence (we are italians, we like to show off) (3) a sort of inferiority complex against D&amp;D in too many players.<br/><br/>But all this don't really explain to me... why can't you simply make an american gamer play Polaris once, and turn him forever into a "dirty hippie gamer" as we do?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_204918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204918/#Comment_204918" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-02T12:28:37+00:00" title="May  2, 2009 12:28PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>I am talking about some games that could become great games, if properly tested, prodded, changed, but they will never be.</blockquote>One thing to keep in mind is that in any creative medium \u2014 <em>any</em> of them \u2014 there are always far more "could be greats" than there are "greats."  This is also true for story games, and it's difficult, but you eventually have to say, "Yep, that's how it's going to be, and that's all right."<br/><br/>Also, a lot of old Forgies gild their memories of how well the Forge worked "back then."  We remember the games that succeeded, but we don't remember the many, many games that did not flourish, and the Forge had (and has) its own "could be greats" that, as you say, "will never be."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204919/#Comment_204919" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-02T12:38:11+00:00" title="May  2, 2009 12:38PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Moreno,<br/><br/>I played Lady B, posted about it, IMed with John about it and the pdf changed for the better as a result.

I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing, though.<br/><br/>This is NOT a design forum.  Really <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  I remember Andy specifically talking about how the Forge was good for that, but what he wanted out of SG was different.  The design category here is only a small (and reluctant) part of the site.  Even the Actual Play category is named "Vignettes" for a reason: Andy wanted (correct me if I misremember, Andy) to avoid lengthy analytical play reports and instead have some fun social sharing of cool events in our games.  This place is much more about socializing with each other, and part of that are definitely certain fads.  Social networks get excited about something, things spread, then something else comes along. <br/><br/>The Forge is still going strong.  If I need design or publishing help, or help analyzing actual play, that's where I go (and I try to head over there and help out once in a while, too).  Story Games is my Happy Place; I come here to soak up positivity and enthusiasm about our hobby.  What exactly the fad for that is at any given time is really secondary for me. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204936/#Comment_204936" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-02T16:02:54+00:00" title="May  2, 2009  4:02PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Moreno, I really don't know how to answer your questions.

The "danger" is into using it to fulfill ANOTHER need, for example using it as a design forum.

I don't necessarily know how I feel about it, being neither fully within the group that's riding the bleeding-edge wavefront of indie design, nor in the curmudgeonly old "Sorcerer was good enough for my grandfather, so Sorcerer is good enough for me!" camp, either. I've noticed the love heaped on the new and cool. I've done some of it. But I've also seen some stuff that I've turned away from, shaking my head, because it was just too out there for me. Your Oracle games idea is one such. I don't deny that it's doing cool things for those that dig it.

To think I believed that English was YOUR first language....<br/><br/>But, even after checking another time my posts, I am rather sure that anybody with (1) a elemental knowledge of English, and (2) the attention span sufficient to read a forum post before running to post a personal attack against the poster, would have noticed that my critique on Story-games and this latest fad-fest isn't based on the presence of recognition: it's based on the ABSENCE of recognition. <br/><br/>I said, in plain English (must I quote myself here? Or I can trust you to be able to find my posts above?) that the problem is that recognition, here, has TOO SHORT A DURATION, I said that after a very little time, THAT RECOGNITION VANISH, while, at the Forge (and not only at the Forge) it endure. I said that there should be MORE recognition.<br/><br/>But I suppose that trying to explain this is English is a wasted effort: it seems than the "zen" here changed, without anybody noticing, from a general supportive atmosphere, to a consensus reality where everything is good and well, everything is awesome, and if someone don't agree, you don't even have to do the effort to read what he write: you already know, after all, everything he could have written, right?<br/><br/>And I wondered why this forum had so short an attention span...

What the is the deal with all the sarcasm about English? As it happens, Graham's well versed in English. So am I. I have a degree in the subject, even. Neither of which matters one bit, particularly when you metaphorically wave your arms around screaming about how things should be.  <br><br>I'm glad you have found so many new ideas and enjoyable games since discovering various indie RPGs. But, here, you're ranting. That you can't see it should be a warning sign to fellow posters that you're not communicating with us, you're hollering at us. It should also be a warning sign to you that you need to re-evaluate what you're saying. <br><br>Here's an example: \n<blockquote>What this mean is the story-games version of the White Wolf supplement treadmill. What this mean it's a memory so short-range that fucking GAMING MODULES are seen as the latest innovation of cutting edge game design.</blockquote>\nThis is you ranting about some alleged awful phenomemon, yet you name no designers or games, showing no actual harm done to anyone at all. People take offense to this language, like it or not. And, in this case I think they're correct to. You're communicating in a way about a community that judges people's enjoyment because it clashes with your preferences some. (For example, this "cool kids" language is a waste of time, nevermind that you never identify just who this conspiracy of elite hobbyists is and what they actually do that's harmful.)<br><br>I think you should re-evaluate your subsequent shock and anger that people read sentences like yours above and then dismiss you or point out that you're being disingenuous. You are being exactly that. It's exactly why I said "I don't know how to respond to you." You seemed to need a rant platform. Now, I think you're beating Graham over the head with the platform! <br/><br/>All of this after you openly admit you rant about these topics. So, take a breath, evaluate your own communications, and participate again if you think you want to.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205207/#Comment_205207" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-04T12:07:07+00:00" title="May  4, 2009 12:07PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Whoa, whoa.

That very thing that he's talking about is what Matt started this thread talking about. No one ever out right said that wanting recognition was bad. I can't really speak for Matt, but I picked it up subconsciously. I never read the "Purity of Indie Motivations" manual. I just always had this nagging feeling that the desire for validation would be subtly sneered at.</p>\n<p>Maybe he implied that you were doing exactly that. I can see where it would be interpreted that way, because I basically read the same thing. But I'm not there in his headspace, and I've tried to take a concept that was once articulated at the Forge to heart; I read it charitably. I tried to assume the best possible meaning.. Which was simply that he was making an observation without making an accusation.</p>\n<p>And maybe he's wrong, either way. I read you as posting an observation of your own. I don't think you're sneering or being snide.</p>\n<p>I also think it doesn't matter. Some interesting, rewarding (if only to me) discussion has come of this, no matter what the intentions of the posters.</p>\n<p>Ralph,</p>\n<p>I recognize what you recognize. But I agree wholeheartedly with what Moreno said upthread; This is what S-G is. It's not the Forge. It tries very hard to be its own thing, and it does that well. I've seen it said that S-G is a toxic place full of false friendships and insincerity. I don't agree with that, either. The Forge and S-G have their own grooves, and it's silly to try to make one do the same thing as the other. I've made the mistake at least a few times, trying to use S-G as a place to do serious discussion of a game design. Some things work great here, some things don't. Beautiful things are birthed as a result of the interactions here. Some of those things will go on to be polished into gleaming gems of quality, others will be the fondly remembered flavor of the month.</p>\n<p>If you want one of those flavors of the month to become something more, then do something about it. Tap the author on the shoulder and have a chat with him. If it's free-range awesome, scoop it up and polish it yourself. Take it to the Forge or your working forum of choice for feedback, or do it here, or whatever best suits your needs.</p>\n<p>Meh. I'm suddenly bored with this. I'll take a quick opportunity to thank everyone who weighed in prior to about a day prior to this post for their contributions. My personal zen is pretty harshed outside of this, and I'm done trying to fix it for now.</p>\n<p>Peace.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205210/#Comment_205210" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-04T12:10:16+00:00" title="May  4, 2009 12:10PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2009 12:39PM by Brand_Robins.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>we've built a culture that primarily rewards the creative brainstorming end and only modestly encourages and rewards the longer term activities that take a great game idea and turn it into a great game.</blockquote>\nThis is why I no longer talk about Dogs in the Vineyard or Primetime Adventures. <br/><br/>Except I just did talk about Dogs in the Vineyard. <br/><br/>Oh shit, then I did it again!<br/><br/>....<br/><br/>Thing is, there is a cult of the "RPG.net darling of the month" that's now the "Storygames darling of the month" (Indie is the New Trad), but that's just because that's how hype works in semi-connected online communities. If Clay Shirky hasn't written an article about it, I'll be shocked. <br/><br/>Things tend to work differently in real life play groups and such. Which is why I probably go back to praising a small handful of games over and over -- I do seem to mention Dogs in the Vineyard, Unknown Armies, or IAWA every third post. My group plays these games, talks about these games, loves these games and has done so over the course of years. (Well, a year and a bit in the case of IAWA.) So when I'm with them, I talk about them. <br/><br/>When I'm on SG, otoh, I do tend to talk about the new thing. Because excitement over the new thing is one of the few things I've got in common with a lot of people and their connection to game. You've (plural "you've') not played the same games I have, not been in my campaigns, not seen the things I've done, not got any emotional connection to them. AP posts can partly mitigate this -- but not fully, and only so long as my rhetoric stays honest. (Rare.) <br/><br/>So, as this isn't a design forum, and isn't a forum where we play together, and isn't a forum with a long memory (its amazing how many posts happen here every year like my annual hayfever), we tend to talk about the new thing. Some of us go on to play that new thing, but after the joint excitement is gone, we tend to not talk about it because... well, because the play isn't something we actually share. <br/><br/>(And unlike the Forge there isn't a lot of ongoing work on making into something we do share. The value and health of the AP forum on the Forge is not to be underestimated. Nor is the slow burn, but constant front page presence, of the publisher forums.) <br/><br/>....<br/><br/>So if you really don't like this, what can we do? <br/><br/>Well, more AP, more talking about ongoing play of games that have been out for awhile would probably be help. Folks still playing 3:16, Sorcerer, Dogs, PTA, whatever? Talk about it. AP posts (at least ones that aren't dull as dirt) do still get some play around here. <br/><br/>Maybe set up contests or awards that take place over a longer term? I personally have nothing but spite for RPG design contests, but I'm bitter and full of hate about life in general, so I'm sure someone who likes them could figure something out. <br/><br/>Malcolm Sheppard has recently been talking about doing an RPG award that focuses on older games, rather than "what was hot this year." His idea is to look at games older than three years (or maybe five, I don't remember exactly) and have a panel of voters who are willing to make substantive criticism of the game and the ways they've played it over years and how it holds up in the long term. That way you look at historical trends in games, what has lasting value, and which games really hold a place in your heart rather than which game has the buzz this year or looked innovative in the package. <br/><br/>More things here, but now I'm hungry, so I'll leave them to everyone else to argue about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205225/#Comment_205225" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-04T12:36:33+00:00" title="May  4, 2009 12:36PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This topic is just a powder keg no matter how you slice it, innit?<br/><br/>Another little tidbit that hasn't been touched on: supply and demand.  There's a demand for recognition of your creativity, and there's a supply of recognition for creative efforts.  Back in the 90s, when there was one designer for every hundred gamers, getting published could get you a pretty big slice of the recognition pie (in Joe Everyman terms; designers were never rockstars).  With the advent of POD technologies, however, the ratio of designers to gamers is plummeting towards 1:1 \u2014 and that's designers to gamers; consider actual games to gamers, and we're probably upside-down with <em>more games than gamers</em>.  (I've personally spawned, what, six or seven designs?)  There are, what, 200 regular posters on story-games, and every year sees <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9229" rel="nofollow">at least 200 drafts of games in various stages of appreciation-target-availability</a>.  In such a milleu, getting recognition for most anything is going to be fleeting and superficial.  There are a few exceptions, sure, but they are just that: <em>exceptions</em>.<br/><br/>Longing for more considered appreciation for gaming products is tantamount to asking people to stop designing and start appreciating full-time.  Guess how likely that is to happen?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205238/#Comment_205238" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-04T12:59:55+00:00" title="May  4, 2009 12:59PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2009 1:01PM by John_Harper.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent point, Josh.

I suspect that for every designer there are many, <i>many</i> gamers who just play, and never design a darn thing.

The beginning of this thread is in another thread. <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=203846" rel="nofollow">from this post</a> written by Matt Snyder, to be exact. Where he identify a very real phenomena in this forum, and some of the causes, but has a general positive outlook on the effects. He said, quote, "In short, while I'm sure there are downsides, I think this trend is really, really fucking good"<br/><br/>I replied in the same thread, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=203904" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>, suggesting another cause, and the risk of the closing on the community into itself.<br/><br/>Matt started this thread with a post where explained better his thoughts on the designer's motivations (his own, and other's), and many other answered, taking the thread in a different direction. I waited before answering Matt's initial post because I didn't want to silence that direction. So I <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=204903" rel="nofollow">posted</a> only when the thread calmed down (and I suspect that many people, who read only the new posts and don't remember the previous one, saw that as a threadjack and not as the return to the original discussion that started it) , explaining better my thoughts, too. (and adding the last part, that was ignored, to answer your thoughts about the "failure" of indie games to turn traditional gamers into dirty hippies)<br/><br/>Matt, I would like for you to read that post again. And tell me WHERE in that post I tell people what they have to do, where I tell people they have to stop doing what they enjoy doing, where I tell people that story-game has to change, or that it's a bad place. I didn't do any of that. I only said what my thoughts were about these latest tendencies, exactly like you did. I am not someone who just arrived here and started trolling: I write and read here regularly from three years ago, almost from when this place started. I have always seen the term "cool kids" used by almost everyone, and I don't think it become suddenly offensive now. THAT'S disingenuous.<br/><br/>It's for reason that I don't understand your following reply: "Moreno, I really don't know how to answer your questions". I was asking a single thing (that you answered), the rest was a different view about what's happening. Not questions. What can you say as a reply? You can say you agree, or that you disagree, or that you disagree in part and agree in part, or you could detail more your views, you could ask questions, or you could have simply not replied... I don't know, people do this all the time in web forums...  But your reply was the first of a string a really dismissive ones (after the first three, from Josh, Judd and Christian, that instead engaged with my points) that followed. Oh, not every reply was dismissive: some show, I think, only that the author missed my point (the first one from John), some other continued to engage them, and there were even supporting post. But there were enough posts that showed simply a basic intent of putting everything I said under the rug, and paint me as the troll of the week who shows only to say that people have to do what he say, to annoy me.<br/><br/>Graham's post was the last straw. My reply was rude? I don't think I have shown him any less respect that he did show me. The things I said could be wrong? Say why, tell your experience, debate, discuss, or, if you don't believe I will engage honestly with your points, ignore me. But what's the matter with all the people who posted only to threadcrap? What's the matter with Graham posting what amounted to little more than a personal attack, ignoring everything I said in my posts and telling me what I "surely" really meant to say?<br/><br/><i>(I have to continue in another post, I did wrote too much...)</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205382/#Comment_205382" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-05T10:58:56+00:00" title="May  5, 2009 10:58AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2009 11:02AM by Moreno R..">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>(continued from the previous post)</i><br/><br/>I should really stop here, say that it's better to stop this discussion, and I risk being labeled as a "troublemaker that disturb the Zen", if I am not already. But I believed that discussions about these things would be useful, if we could avoid the threadcraps.  And that these threadcraps shown a basilar insecurity in this place. <br/><br/>In any web forum you find, there are ALWAYS people who pretend to enjoy something to "fit in". To be "with the cool guys". It's normal, it's human, and usually it's done by a minority of people, while most of the others are sincere when they say that they enjoy something. But this is something of a hot button for story-games, because this forum is regularly attacked in other places (or, sometimes, even here) as being full of people who rave about games that they don't really enjoy playing. Taking away the bile of some loser and the silly wars that people with no life declare on other forums, I think that many people here were hurt by these attack (and so they react to ANY critic as if it was about this) because they know (or they fear) that there is a small speck of truth in it: that in story-games that minority I talked above is greater than usual.<br/>Why I think so? Well, (1) the insecurity shown above, (2) the fact that some cases of this were reported (I didn't keep the links, sorry), (3) historical causes, and (4) forum peculiarities.<br/>(3) historical causes:  these games reached a bigger public before the culture of play that spawned them did.  A lot of them, specially at the beginning, didn't do a very good job of explaining how to play them (not that traditional rpgs are better: but they don't have to explain a different distribution of game authorities every time), so a lot of people still played them in a very "traditional" way, or in some parlor narration version. Please, read carefully: I am not talking about "badwrongfun": if you have fun, you are playing right. I am talking about people who don't know how to play these games, and don't have fun. Sometimes, even now, I am one of those: everybody is, sometimes, it's not always possible to understand from the beginning how a game work. Someone ask, someone try again, someone begin to say in other forum that these games are all unfun, and someone feign having fun but change game as soon as possible. And this go to cause (4):<br/>(4) forum peculiarities: go to rpg.net, and search for threads about these games. Most of them are questions about them from people who don't own the game, or people who ask how to play them or about some rules. The Forge is a more tecnhical forum, so there aren't any "sell me on" threads, but there are A LOT of threads about how to play these games, even the more simple ones. After all these years there are a lot of threads about how to play The Pool, or DitV.  Look around the web: EVERY forum about rpgs is like this, with people who ask questions about rules. Even the ones about D&amp;D. With one exception. A single exception: story-games.<br/>How many thread about how to play a game or how to read a rule do you see at story-games, these days? Once, they were common as in the Forge: you don't have to go back a lot of time to see threads about what kickers are, how to play bangs, etc: where are they now?<br/><br/>We (yes: we: as I said, I was here almost from the beginning. I was one of the people who let it happen. This post is a way to amend in part for it) have build a community where people is too embarrassed to say that they don't know how to play a game, or that they have difficulties, when almost everybody instead show off the way they are so "cool" that they are able to hack anything into anything (Yes, they are GMs so skilled, that they can run anything: system doesn't matter...)<br/><br/>I see all these things (the posturing, the culture of play that doesn't follow the games, the short memory, the insecureness) as tied together, and with the "tiredness" that Matt talked about. They are all faces of the same problems. But maybe I am a troll, and all is nice, good and shiny in indieland...<br/><br/>P.S.:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite><b>All the other people who've developed successful games and like talking about the craft had left the Forge and hang out on SG.</b></blockquote>\nNot everybody (Vincent is still there, and Luke posted a lot lately, and I am sure I am forgetting a lot of others too), but many did.

There was no place to talk about your recent awesome game, or other general gaming topics. It's a powerhouse, a machine for getting information related to finishing roleplaying ideas, and publishing them. The Publishing forum of The Forge is probably the best place anywhere on the internet to find information related to publishing games, or problems with publishing games (yeah, I was a little surprised at the Lulu stuff too).<br/><br/>The only time where folks could BS was back on the GNS/Theory forums, but that got out of hand, and detracted from the creation and production of games. The only other, sanctioned time was during the yearly "Birthday Forum", where for a week a forum was opened where you could ask people about what they were playing, what their favorite games were, what the best system for "X" was, etc (as well as totally tangent topics, like martial arts, movies, politics and religion). S-G was originally developed as kind of a "Forge Birthday Forum, All The Time". Later, I codified it, basically drawing the line in the sand that separated this forum from the Forge: "If you want help with your new RPG idea, go to the Forge; there's really no network here to support that sort of thing. If you want to talk about playing games and you frequent the Forge, do that discussion here instead, as there's really no network there to support that sort of thing". <br/><br/>Cut to 3 years later. A lot's changed, but that stance of "If you want to do ground up game design, go to the Forge. If you want help publishing your game, or have publishing questions, go to the Forge" still stands. <br/><br/>Very recently, some folks have been doing private little projects for themselves or their own gaming groups, and making the grave mistake of showing them to others (Lady Blackbird, "Oracle Games", etc) on this forum, which are then criticized for their slack attitude towards complete game design. But I think that's totally fine. It's like starting a thread showing people how you pimped out your gaming room (complete with pictures), which encourages other people in turn to pimp out their own gaming room and taking pictures of their results. Or about how you made a bag for carrying your gaming books, to which other people respond by showing their game-bag creations.<br/><br/>Sure, people talk about designing and stuff here, it's just what happens in a lounge filled with people who are interested in tinkering under the hood ("No talking about car repair! This is only a forum about car driving!"), but again I like to keep the focus on the play and general discussion threads. That's also the reason why I still keep "Game Design Help" a private discussion forum: I don't want people outside to see those threads, thinking that's what this place is about ("Oh, I'll join S-G and get help with my new game design!". Seems implausible, but *a lot* of people have joined this forum, with that phrase or a variant in their "Why do you want to join?" submission sentence. To which I kind of get nervous, but I still have yet to see the little design threads overtake the play/game discussion threads). And yet, I don't mind if people ask a question here or there in this community when they want some ernest help with some roadblock they're having. 'Sides, lots of the little design stuff that pops up here can again find itself back on the gaming table, to be used as a player or GM (ex: "Generating Culturally Rich NPCs"). But as soon as I start seeing, "Here's an idea for a game that I'm starting to design, what do you think?", my response is usually "I think you should go over to The Forge for more help".<br/><br/>Just my two cents, as a passive observer.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>EDIT: Crossposted with fnord: Answer: "Nope, that's me, too.
