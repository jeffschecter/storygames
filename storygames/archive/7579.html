"Respondents consistently said that predicaments they'd seen play out on House were worse than their loved ones' bouts with emphysema, and that they had experienced greater rejection over unrequited love during Grey's Anatomy than they had in their own lives." Alonso said the study, performed on adults over the age of 21, does not necessarily contradict an earlier report that found children who witnessed drama on TV were more likely to commit drama themselves.</blockquote>\nI particularly like the last line.<br/><br/>So, in gaming terms, have you become desensitized to conflict? Do you yearn for a game in which you can just push characters around without having to care what this means to anyone else. Is all that stuff just a bunch of gay cowboys eatin' puddin'?<br/><br/>Perhaps this explains the popularity of 4e, Poison'd and 3:16 amongst story games who have stopped caring about relationship and wanted to get back to some good old fashioned killing things and taking their stuff. Perhaps this also explains the rise in interest in jeep with its more intensely personal style of gaming - the emotions are heightened and there's no rolling to see who cares about the contest, you have to care, there's nothing else. It's not just story now, it's emotion now.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168183/#Comment_168183" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-10T07:09:53+00:00" title="September 10, 2008  7:09AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I totally haven't become desensitized to personal conflict.
