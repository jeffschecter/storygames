Having only two systems of T2 or higher doesn't necessarily mean that all ships in the cluster using slipdrives will belong to those two systems, it just means that that technology has its ultimate origin in those systems. That could give those systems ultimate control (as seemed the case in your game), but it could just mean that everyone else buys ships and repair supplies from those two systems so they have very rich space-dock industries and no extra political or military clout. That's one of the dials that each table can set for themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel" title="Anarchangel"><img alt="Anarchangel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/333/nG33DU7UK4MTS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anarchangel">Anarchangel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274410/#Comment_274410" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-03T22:31:07+00:00" title="June  3, 2010 10:31PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for those, I enjoyed listening!<br><br>You made me realise that I'd been playing compels in combat incorrectly, so now it's a house rule for me that compels work normally in the mini-games, <b>plus</b> they can be used for the relevant mini-game effect.

If there was an issue it's that I took that last phase TOO seriously.  My last phase was that this ship had failed to produce anything profitable for the company I worked for.  I had the Aspect "The Company Is Breathing Down My Neck".<br><br>So in the first session Will put us on an ancestor worshiping planet and we were exploring some of their forbidden Ruins.  So I tagged an Aspect for effect to make the ancestors of these people the Irens, so as to make this place of cultural significance to the two Iren PCs.  I then had no intention of leaving that planet until I had developed it into a profitable labor force for my company.  <br><br>In fact the only reason I left briefly at all was because the Irens demanded a contract which I wasn't going to broker without the support of the home office.  Otherwise as far as I was concerned the entire game was going to take place on that planet while I dismantled the natives culture.<br><br>Jesse                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274602/#Comment_274602" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-04T16:32:09+00:00" title="June  4, 2010  4:32PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I chuckled at Laura's exclamation about Kildoc and why he was even in the game.

Sean builds the badass, lone warrior type but then doesn't do the typical gamer thing of using that as an excuse not to care about anything.  Quite the opposite, he dives right into the whole "noble bonds of savagery" and "if you fuck with my friends, you fuck with me!" thing.<br><br>He was attached to my character in that Kildoc was my bodyguard and used my character as a moral compass in what to him was an alien culture.  The fact that we were dealing with warrior nomads was yet another reason I didn't want to leave the planet.  I wanted to know how long Kildoc would let me corrupt a culture so similar to his own.<br><br>The biggest disconnect was probably simply between me and Will.  Will was trying to run a game of episodic space adventures and everything I did was just Phase I of my plan for conquest by capitalist culture.<br><br/>Jesse                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
