                    Hello there, Story-games.com<br/><br/>My name is Eric Bennett, and I have a problem.<br/><br/>I love percentiles. I adore them. My most positive experiences introducing new people to the hobby have been with percentiles. They are easy to play with, transparent in their probabilities, and rolling two dice is [i]just[/i] about the right number to feel right.<br/><br/>I like the way percentile stats look on a sheet. They look...respectable. Odd aesthetic? Maybe, but they have class, dammit!<br/><br/>What am I posting this for? Simple...I want you, the kind people of Story Games, to help me make the percentiles great again. I love this Forgite mechanics that I have been exposed to of late, these Dogs in the Vineyard, these InSpectres, these Cranium Rats, these PrimeTimes Adventures...but they are like Chinese food. Filling and great when you eat them, but something just feels [i]lacking[/i] when you finish.<br/><br/>I want to combine percentiles with some sort of narrative control mechanism. I would sacrifice goats to Cthulhu if some means of dueling resolution, ala Dogs, could be conceived, though that is more of a pet project of mine than anything else. <br/><br/>Tell me, then. What do you like about percentiles? What do you dislike? What games have you converted from percentiles to some other method, and why? And any suggestions about turning them into the kind of mechanics that I have come to enjoy of late?<br/><br/>I'm not asking for someone to design me a resolution system. I want your ideas. I want your [i]pieces[/i]. I'll cook something up with them given time...<br/><br/>EDIT: Wrong piece. I think I saved over the rewrite. Bugger.<br/><br/>Yr. rambling srvt,<br/>Eric Bennett                </div>

                            This is only a partial answer to your questions, and come right off the top of my head.  Caveat lector.<br/>
<br/>
The good and bad thing about percentiles is their containment--as soon as you invoke the percentile, you know the system has a very defined upper and lower limit.  You aren't going to get negative percentile rolls or rolls that exceed 100%.  That allows for some quick on the fly estimations (hmm, I think you have about a 50% chance of succeeding...).<br/>
<br/>
Now, you could structure a system with percentile dice to exceed the 1 to 100, but I suspect you would need to be careful with that.  If you break the containment provided by the percentile, you end up with a system with enormous variability (roll, get a number anywhere from 1 to 100, add related modfiers...).  <br/>
<br/>
If you want to go with percentile dice, I would think the resulting system should be relatively fine grained so that there is some difference between 54 and 57, not just between 51 and 61 (otherwise, why not just use d10).  <br/>
<br/>
Rolemaster did some neat things, but, man, I would want to avoid that kind of chart craziness--that seems like it could kill a narrative premise.  What if the even/odd status of the result mattered--either the number as a whole ('61') or its components ('6' and '1')?  To keep the flavor you would probably want resolution tied to the percentages, but you could color that result based on something like its even-oddness.  Allow someone to make a certain kind of narrative move based on the nature of the result?  A well-developed 'parasite' like this could even stand in for a card mechanic--the interaction between the two dice invoking/allowing someone to invoke effects that alter the narrative of the game.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps my least favorite application of percentage dice--1st Edition D&amp;D thieves skills.  For the character progression laid out by the levels system, the percentages always seemed way to low for a majority of their career.  Who would try to pick pockets if more than half the time they were caught?  Other pecentage mechanics have gone awry with this as well--they retain a large range for character growth by making new characters remarkably ineffective.  I would be careful with character generation, watching for this trend (unless the premise is such that character incompetence plays an important role...).                        </div>

                            I just caught this on my way out for the evening, so I'll give a better reply later, but...<br/>
<br/>
I want to keep things contained between 1-100, but like UA, have different sections mean different things. To give an example straight from UA, a Stat 70% Skill 35% guy might get a success on anything under 70, but a success under 35 gives a <i>better</i> success. Kind of like, I suppose, the Judgement Ring from Shadow hearts? That could make a cool visual on the character sheet, maybe...<br/>

Anyway, better answer tomorrow. For now, sleep.                        </div>

                            So, um, the first thing I thought of with percentiles is this really bad pseudo-Evangelion story written by this guy I know. Basically, it had the main character achieving "350% synchronization levels" with an AI. There was a side character who made a mistake and ended up with a negative synchronization level. What on earth does it mean to be negatively synchronized?!<br>

I'm sorry. :)                        </br></br></div>

                            What I <i>dislike</i> about percentiles is their absolute transparency and lack of mystery. The character feels more like a collection of numbers precisely because the numbers are so easy to work in my head.<br><br>That's probably not helpful to you, but maybe this would be: <i>low</i> percentiles are the worst. If I see something low like a 16%, 25% or even 33% on the sheet, I don't even want to try to make the roll.

<br/>
A cool thing to do with that transparency of the percentiles is set up the advancement system such that Failures (on legit conflicts, a la BW) of low value traits makes them increase in value, but Failures on high-value traits makes them decrease. Interesting implications, no?<br/>
<br/>
(And you can arbitrarily define the meaning of low vs high value to get the right feel...) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Or for true zaniness:  Use a percentile die mechanic, but attach it to wierd things - like relationships, resources, character flaws, etc...                        </div>

if you're using percentiles, you had DAMN well better have something that happens at 01 or 00, preferably both.<br/>

And Adam: What you're talking about has nothing to do with the percentiles themselves, but rather the scores associated with them.                        </div>

                            Sempternity, that means that your scores will average over time. The more you fail with something high, the more likely you are to fail, and the more you fail with something low, the less likely you are to fail, keeping it where it is. I bet there are very specific numbers that long-term play will hover around.<br/>
<br/>
One possibility is reroll: traits or whatever give you the opportunity to reroll. <br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps you roll another d10 and add it to the 1s die.<br/>
<br/>
But what's weird here is that we're talking about a dice mechanic that has no context. First, figure out what the players and their characters are going to do, then figure out the mechanic.                        </div>

<p><code>But what's weird here is that we're talking about a dice mechanic that has no context.</code></p>
<p>I don't think it's weird at all.</p>
<p>I think that getting a grip on a dice mechanism and it's permutations without game context is pretty well essential to having that mechanism produce the type of play I'm looking for.  Indeed, I don't think that I even need to have a type of play in mind to make discussing mechanisms useful and interesting.</p>
<p>If assembling a car is analagous to game design, and picking out the right motor is good mechanism choosing for good game design, then discussing mechanisms out of context is like stocking &amp; tuning engines without a car in mind.  It makes you better prepared when it's time to make the final product.</p>

                            Actually, Adam, that is helpful. I've never approached my characters that way, or had the trouble of the percentiles mucking up my illusion of the character.  Actually, I find it somewhat more helpful than things like 2d4 or 8d6 or what have you, because it lets the player get a better grip on the character's degree of capability. As for low numbers, like I said above I think any percentile system concocted after Unknown Armies really should have that stat/skill division in there somewhere, because you get a degree of graniness on your "skills", but your range of success is usually 50%+. Your skill rankings are just the place where you succeed better.<br/>
<br/>
Sempiternity: I've never thought of having failure of high ranking traits cost you points for using them. I imagine that if you combined that with a do-it-yourself trait system, it would discourage the use of needlessly broad traits, as the more often you makea check against it, the more chances you have to roll that 00 or other high number. <br/>
<br/>
You also intrigue me with this attachment of percentile dice to relationships and resources. An early draft of Mythos, while it was still in percentile mode, had the Sanity meters as percentiles, adding or subtracting their rating to certain traits when they came into play. I liked that dynamic, but it really is something that can also be done with single dice, too.<br/>
<br/>
Vaxalon: Low handling time is one of my personal attractions to percentiles. This doesn't jive with a lot of the indie games I've gotten ahold of, mostly because the dice only come into play in limited circumstances, then get out of the way when you finish. It doesn't enage the game-y elements of the roleplaying experience as well, I would imagine, but...I'm not sure that is all that bad a goal. <br/>
<br/>
Isbo: You hit what I am trying to go after pretty closely. Once you have a percentile generated, there are a great many things you can do with it and ways to read it. You can add the dice together, take the high die, read them straight, check even/odd...I think that might also address Adam's complaint to a degree, in that the percentile is just where you start from for resolution and  your reading of the dice provides a variety of numbers to play with.                        </div>

                            I dislike the linear, highly granular nature of percentile dice.  If you need linearity, structure your mechanic around a single, clean platonic solid or something.  If you need more granularity than, say, a bell-curved combination of three dice provides, I'd question your design goals.  Percentiles seem so clinical to me. <br/><br/>Unknown Armies, as has been mentioned, does some playful things with percentiles and I think that's cool.  <br/><br/>What if you used percentiles, but the ten digits were tied to specific effects in some way:<br/><br/>"Oh damn, I rolled 67, which would ordinarily fail, but my six is always succeed, and my seven is introduce a new character.  I guess a stranger jumps in and helps me out."<br/><br/>That's hot - I think I'll steal that from myself.                        </div>

                            I like Jason's idea, mainly because he's thinking of ways to do new things with the percentile dice.<br/>
<br/>
What if, for example, you rolled percentile dice, but then if you narrated a Trait in, you could roll an additional die, which could either replace the Tens or the Ones die? Or, the more traits you narrated in, the more dice you got to roll, and you could choose which of them were the Tens and which the Ones? Or, by narrating stuff, you could swap the Tens and the Ones? Stuff like that.<br/>

                            Jason and Graham,<br/>
<br/>
That is the sort of stuff I was talking about. Success/fail based on the roll under, with the actual numbers on the dice being what is fiddled with to determine degree or how.<br/>
<br/>
I do like single die types, Jason, but...I dunno. They just don't have that "feel" -a subjective term, yes- that I am trying to capture. Percentiles are a bit clinical and detached, but is that a bad thing? Out of two dice, you can pull a great number of tricks. (Like the one you just proposed, which is very steal-worthy.) You can do this without needing a pound of dice on the table. One of my turnoffs to many games is the sheet quanities of dice that get tossed around. I like percentiles because they are clean. <br/>
<br/>
Hmm...what if you broke the "stats" up across some simple division like Physical/Mental/Social or Power/Finesse/Resistance, and then gave each character 20 slots to fit Traits or quirks or whatever into. A Tens and a Ones catagory. You could either set specific effects to specific numbers, or...what if you could reroll the number associated with a Trait by narrating it in, or add an extra die that might be swapped out by doing so? It avoids the total whiffing you can sometimes get, and would keep the player engaged in the telling of the story...<br/>
<br/>
Or so I think,<br/>

                            I know that the many of the qualities you are looking for are subjective, so "die feel" is something you've got to work out for yourself.  Me, I like a friggin' bucket of dice being tossed.  It lets me know I'm playing a game.  <br/><br/>There are all kinds of gymnastics you can do with a pair of dice!  I toyed with a system that used ten- and one-place dice, but six siders, for a constrained range of 11-66, at one point.  A (sadly nonintuitive)  linear scale with 36 steps.  Didn't work out for the project, but an interesting idea, I think.<br/><br/>(edit:  I can't do math)                        </div>

                            You don't have to constrain the dice. You can do a "Mastery" thing like HeroQuest. 132% is basically 1 Mastery + 32% chance of something cool in addition, or additional actions in a task-based system, etc. "I'll use my Fighting 150% to take a 100% attack and a second 50% attack." "I have 150% Diplomacy, so let's assume I avoid war, but I want to take a 50% chance of convincing the ambassador that I'm actually the Galactic President."<br/>
<br/>
You can do opposed rolls pretty easy with percentiles. Highest roll that still succeeds wins. If I have Fighting 85% and you have Fighting 65% and you roll a 64 and I roll an 89, you win (I failed my roll). If I roll 80 and you roll 65, I win (we both succeed but I rolled higher). If I roll 12 and you roll 50, you win (we both succeed but you rolled higher). This makes a 100% roll not a sure thing, since you can still roll crappy.<br/>
<br/>
My problem with percentile systems is that they tend to get mathy. I've seen a lot of +10, +25, -30 type modifiers. I've seen a lot of "divide by 2 for a challenging action, divide by 3 for a really hard action, divide by 10 for a super hard action." Division is a pain during play. <br/>
<br/>
Avoid trait + skill systems because it slows down play to have to add 22+91 before you roll. You can do interesting things by giving players additional rolls instead (make a 91% roll, then make a 22% roll).                        </div>

                            Don't forget other things that you can do with the Object Called Dice:<br>------------------<br>You can use them in conjunction with other objects.  You could stack them on cards for some sort of meaning. <br>------------------<br><br>You could split up a conflict into three tasks: The player rolls percentile, then "divides the result" three times and places those against the tasks of the conflict:<br>GET TO THE LAB WITHOUT BEING SEEN<br/>Requires:<br/>Sneak 20 to get past the guards<br/>Sneak 20 to avoid the cameras<br/>Perception 30 to watch the keycode being entered into the lab pad.<br/><br/>My Sneak is 10, My Perception is 12. This makes 22. Then I roll percentages, adding it to this total. I get a 34, for a total of 56: I split that up into three sets of percentiles, 20, 30 and 06, and match those up with cards representing tasks:<br/>Sneak 20: I put 20 down, I sneak past the guards without being seen, but just barely.<br/>Sneak 20: I put down 6, wihtout my knowing a camera spots me, alerting someone deeper within the compound.<br/>Perception 30: I put down 30, again just barely making it. It looks like a 9 digit code, I caught the last 7 digits and just happened to guess/infer the first two numbers correctly.<br/>----------------------<br/><br/>You could involve color: Something involving associating attributes or skills to colors, and rolling the dice or picking dice depending on the attributes or skills. An example is, say a game where the ten die can be flipped: Peace is white dice and Violence is red dice. You're trying to get your teacher to let you out of class. For ones you roll a "colorless seven". You also roll a Red dice for 7, and a White die for 1. You can decide to take the one, try to talk your way past the teacher and fail, or jump on the violence die, kick her teeth in and get past her that way... but which will you choose?<br/><br/>Just a few thoughts.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>
