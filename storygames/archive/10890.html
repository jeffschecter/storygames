Subscribing to the Insider for 3 months ($24) is the first money I've spent on D&amp;D 4th.<br/><br/>It's pretty mind-boggling how much they are giving you.<br/>The D&amp;D Compendium lists all of the Races, Classes, Powers, Skills and Feats (ie, everything the player needs) as well as Traps (300) and Monsters (~3,000).<br/>Dungeon and Dragon magazines are both there, which include Adventures (and a bunch of stuff that also appears automatically in the Compendium).<br/>There's a Monster Builder, and a Character Builder, with the ability to generate a one-click character.<br/><br/>In short, if you have a printer, you don't need to ever buy a book.<br/>Well, not true, I suppose... you need to learn how to play from somewhere, but if someone teaches you (or you download a PDF of the PHB), then the D&amp;D Insider is the only purchase you ever need to make.<br/><br/>It feels like there's a lot of resources here, they're all linked up nicely (Stuff from Dragon also appears in the Compendium), and some of them are super useful.<br/><br/>...just wanted to share how impressed I was.<br/>Now, if they have a free SRD somewhere as well, then the D&amp;D Insider is literally the only purchase one ever needs to make.<br/>Is such a thing in existence?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241564/#Comment_241564" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-12T01:27:57+00:00" title="November 12, 2009  1:27AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as I know, Wizards dropped the SRD and OGL licences completely for 4E and went in another direction. This hit the supplement/hack market pretty hard, because with 3.x, the rules were free for use and anyone could write and publish a splatbook for the game, publish it under OGL and pop a D&amp;D-compatible icon on the front cover.<br/><br/>The relevant passage from wiki:<br/><i>"With the release of the fourth edition, Wizards of the Coast has introduced its Game System License, which represents a significant restriction compared with the very open policies embodied by the OGL. In part as a response to this, some publishers (such as Paizo Publishing with its Pathfinder Roleplaying Game) who previously produced materials in support of the D&amp;D product line, have made the decision to continue supporting the 3rd Edition rules, thereby competing directly with Wizards of the Coast. Others, such as Kenzer &amp; Company, are returning to the practice of publishing unlicensed supplements, stressing that copyright law does not allow Wizards of the Coast to restrict third-party usage."</i><br/><br/>So, no, I don't think there is a SRD, or ever will be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241578/#Comment_241578" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-12T04:55:21+00:00" title="November 12, 2009  4:55AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you listen to episode 47 of 2d6 Feet in a Random Direction, Chris, owner of Endgame, talks about how much sales of all the supplements have fallen.

Thanks for the referral!<br/><br/>Since D+D is the biggest RPG seller and they are evidently seeing print publishing as a losing proposition, at least they are killing their book sales by giving away the farm for an online subscription what does that say about POD or other paper products? When the 500lb gorilla moves it changes the whole environment.<br/><br/>I have a vision that book sales will shrink into an art market - with really pretty well made books being the norm - for a small select group of players. The mass sales will be a down load for some kind of PDF reader. The change is already 2/3rds or more done now. We just lack a cheap universal reader (I'm personally not interested in a propriatary reader like the Kindle. I want one that will read any PDF without prejudice.)<br/><br/>The market then will not be about skill in printing books but just about quality of book. May will be able to enter the market but I suspect it will remain the few who can really do it well and that is what will sell product. <br/><br/>All this is yet another reason to move into making board games - the technological take over is a little further down the road. (But it to is coming.)<br/><br/>Maybe I can cater to the art book market?

This doesn't seem to be the case on Amazon. Primal Power is <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>,852 in Books as compared to the Core Rule Book Gif Set is <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>,379. And my local Barnes and Nobles just re-ordered 4-6 copies of most of the major 4E books. Although amongst the people I know with high ranking books for sale on Amazon who are in distribution, Amazon only represents 10% of their sales. D&amp;D; may be an exception.<br/>\n<br/>\nD&amp;D; insider is practically a steal. Consider that Wizards is releasing 10+ new books a year and most of that content is in DDI. Almost everyone in our group of 6+ has a subscription but I believe that's rare. Outside our group, most of my friends have 1 subscription per group. You can also let you subscription lapse, and still use the character creator minus updates. So if your group plays infrequently, it's still a great value. Many digital subscriptions suck because once you stop paying you, you don't have anything to show for it. Not so with DDI.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing that I really dislike about DDI is that they put some rules clarifications and explanations behind the subscription wall. Those should be public.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, Wizards print books are a good value. Reasonably priced and full of useful content. Unfortunately they reuse a lot of obvious art but that's a small flaw. You can even buy power cards if you don't want to buy a book just for powers at 1/3rd the cost of the book. Lots of options.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241599/#Comment_241599" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-12T08:02:57+00:00" title="November 12, 2009  8:02AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>Subscribing to the Insider for 3 months ($24) is the first money I've spent on D&amp;D 4th.</blockquote>\nIf I am an annual subscriber to Dungeons &amp; Dragons Insider but never buy a rulebook, how long until I've spent more on my subscription than I would have on the three core books?

The Compendium is a rules database Done Right.  I have never not been able to find the exact thing I was looking for with a quick compendium search, and it's great for quickly browsing possibilities for monsters or magic items.<br><br>The Monster and Character builder tools are comprehensive, high-quality, and supremely easy to use.  The Character Builder let me whip out eight pregens for a teaching game in about half an hour.  The Monster Builder lets me do one-click level adjustments to preexisting monsters if I want to fine-tune them for an encounter, and prints out very nice looking cards as well.<br/><br/>Dragon and Dungeon are usually decent reads for bus rides, but aren't quite essential.  The Mearls stuff is pretty good, I guess.<br/><br/>My only niggles are that the Builder tools are Windows-only.  In fact, the Monster Builder is the only thing that keeps Windows running in my house.   Also, the print functionality from the Compendium is terrible; WoTC has set the print stylesheet to be ugly ugly ugly, so if I want to print stuff from it, I have to slipstream my own stylesheet in.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241671/#Comment_241671" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-12T11:18:07+00:00" title="November 12, 2009 11:18AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: snej</cite><br/>Basically, if I wanted a game that played like an MMORPG I might as well just go all-out and buy a copy of WoW \u2014 there's at least a Mac version of that. :-P</blockquote>\nCould we keep the irrelevant attacks on the game on other forums, please?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241672/#Comment_241672" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-12T11:25:06+00:00" title="November 12, 2009 11:25AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I basically know nothing about DDI that isn't in this thread.

Some programs they have, like the Character Builder, are downloadable programs that only run on windows.  If you're only getting Insider for the Character Builder and only secondarily care about Dragon and Dungeon, this could be a big deal. If you only care about Dragon and Dungeon and prefer making your characters the old fashioned way, then this might not be an issue at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos" title="Dyson Logos"><img alt="Dyson Logos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos">Dyson Logos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241681/#Comment_241681" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-12T11:38:51+00:00" title="November 12, 2009 11:38AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And Character Builder (and any future tools from DDI, from what I've read) are strongly built around the .net framework, so you can't port them over to other OSs easily, nor will they run on emulators like WINE.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241684/#Comment_241684" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-12T11:46:36+00:00" title="November 12, 2009 11:46AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As to WoTC's money - they are making more from the on line fees big time. <br/><br/>Say you buy $100 in books at a store. The manufacturer sold it to a distributor for a 60% discount (probably more like 55% for WoTC) so the manufacturer gets $45. You have three big off set press books printed in huge print runs so maybe they get them for $5 a book. They are now left with $30. They have a lot of overhead in maintaining the supply chain of paper products. So some of that $30 is used up. Let's say $6 worth. Leaving $24...<br/><br/>The CEO looks at the bottem line. $24 where you have to hustle to sell books or $24 where you have to keep a supply of new online material flowing (which you would have to be doing anyway for paper products). I fully understand why they've done this even though I wonder if it is degrading the brand.<br/><br/>D+D is not splashed big at the major cons like it used to be. Maybe paper products only speak to older players (who don't buy as much) and on line to young players (who do buy) I don't know. Best not to get too nostalgic I guess. <br/><br/>I wonder what people would want in an art book game?<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241688/#Comment_241688" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-12T11:53:20+00:00" title="November 12, 2009 11:53AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, I forgot that they did it in .net.

A little over a year.<br/>Core investment + three supplements a year? Depending on the particular supplements, probably never.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that you can also buy a one month subscription right now ($10), download the Character Builder and Monster Builder, give them their current updates, download the current and backlog issues of Dungeon and Dragon magazine, and then cancel your subscription. You won't get any new updates, but the old stuff will still be there (Which means you get the content from PHB 1 &amp; 2, the Arcane/Divine/Primal/Martial Power series, the first two monster manuals... for that $10 flat fee).<br/><br/>In my opinion, the stuff in D&amp;DI is more useable than the stuff in the books, especially for character building with supplements.<br/>I don't have to flip through multiple books and magazines to find out about different race, class and power list options.<br/>I'd never have been able to build a Kenku Rogue with all of the options from Martial Power, for example, using the books.

It can be easy to go astray and pick options not being used in your campaign (I constantly have to remind one of my players "no, look at the campaign sourcebook, that ritual not being used etc.").  Most D&amp;D players don't want to invest too much time away from table (my impression) but the one thing they like doing is pouring over advancement options so here perhaps not so necessary as many like to peruse their books.  Mostly a "your style" thing for players I think.<br><br>But as a DM, you get the compendium of items and monsters searchable so easily, they've updated to add traps and hazards too.  I need to come up with the fey guardians of those woods, give me all the fey-subtype monsters of level x to x, of this type please.  Oh, a Unicorn, an elite owlbear and some woses great.  My gripe being that descriptions (fluff for add flavour) are not given in the wirte ups (e.g., the knowledge check stuff) though it seems they are gradually improving on that, newer entries include nice fluff as well.  I need to quickly come up with two "attack squads" the evil cult might send after heroes if they are sloppy in their investigation, once again with a basic template (skirmisher and lurker, soldiers and controller) can easily do that fast.<br/><br/>You liked that adventure in Dungeon but need to reskin it to fit your campaign.  Once again swappring out creatures is a cinch.  Monster builder makes fiddling even easier though with the compendium it's probably easier to just pick a lower or higher level critter and reskin it.  Have a PC due for a 9th level item and Player has just said "magic longsword", okay search Items for 9th level weapon etc.<br/><br/>I find 4e much easier to prep than 3.5 was, much easier to spend time on terrain and features and little scripts of trash talk for monsters etc.  The Insider then amps that all up even more.<br/><br/>Rob                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241846/#Comment_241846" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-13T08:54:10+00:00" title="November 13, 2009  8:54AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks to Johnstone, Chris, and Joe.<br/><br/>Joe, when I saw you paid $24 for three months of DDI access, it seemed awfully high (roughly the same as the PH off Amazon).

I want a lv. 7 Tiefling Warlock, a lv. 7 Tiefling Warlord, a lv. 7 Drow Wizard, a lv. 7 Drow Rogue. Oh, and looking down you realize that you need a Defender, so you throw in a lv. 7 Tiefling Swordmage. And, in the event that there is a 6th player, hand them a lv. 7 Tiefling Avenger (3 strikers, one party! THEMATIC STATEMENT!)<br/>Total time taken: 10-15 minutes.<br/><br/>Now I want to write this adventure up! I know that it'll have bad guy Drow and Tieflings (kin against kin!). I also know there's such a thing as a Drider.<br/>I turn to the compendium.<br/>Searching "underdark" gets me only 2 responses: Duergar Scout (lv.4) and Duergar Flesheater (lv.11). Neither feel quite right.<br/>Searching monsters lv5-11, with darkvision, from core rulebooks, who are minions... gets me 12 results. I marvel that there's a monster called "Vampire Spawn Fleshripper".<br/>I look at Legion Devil Guard, loathsome Chanter, Servile Ghost and Vile Pet.<br/>I then do a search for the same, except replace minion with Brute Elite, and I find out there's a lv. 11 named The Thing in the Hold. And one called a Blood Elemental.<br/>Finally, I do a search for "drow" under Creatures, and get a whack of results, selecting: Drow Shadowhunter, Drow Cleric of Lolth, Chosen Mezzodemon and finally Drow Spiderguard. Oh, and there should be tieflings in this dungeon! Search "tiefling" creatures, get a list of results, choose Tiefling Heretic and Karak the Damned.<br/>Finally, I need a final boss fight!<br/>Searching "drow" again gives me nothing like what I want. So instead I search Devils (lv6-11) and find a Pain Devil (lv9). Perfect.<br/><br/>I can easily tweak the levels of these monsters in Monster Builder to make them more appropriate to my party, and construct my encounters:<br/>1. THE GATES OF THE HOLD. 2 Drider Fanglords (at the gates, can be negotiated with by the drow characters)<br/>2. THE DARK CORRIDOR. Drow Shadowhunter, 2 Drow Spiderguard, and a Chosen Mezzodemon.<br/>3. THE TEMPLE HALL. Drow Cleric of Lolth, 3 Loathsome Chanters, 2 Tiefling Heretics.<br/>3 THE INNER HOLD. Drow Spiderguard, and a Blood Elemental (with a skill challenge to prevent The Thing in the Hold from breaking free)<br/>4. THE LORD'S PRIVATE QUARTERS. The lord of this hold (Pain Devil), with his Vile Pet and his lover (Kravak the Damned).<br/><br/>Now I write a bit of backstory. There was this Drow hold, and everything was lovely. And then the lord of this hold fell in love with a Tiefling, named Kravak. Kravak and some of his Tiefling follows joined the hold. Others were repulsed by the idea of living in a den of spiders and villainy, and a rift was formed with their leader Kravak. These Tieflings (A Warlock, a Warlord and a Swordmage) found two Drow (a Wizard and a Rogue) who'd been exiled by their lord for trying to stand up to him and argue a foolish course of action. They also want revenge. Now, these renegades return to the drow hold to destroy their led-astray former masters. They need to pass through the gates of the hold, and will surely encounter additional foes in the adjourning chambers. They'll pass through the Temple of Lolth, into the heart of the chamber, and finally find those two lovers and slay them both. Hurray!<br/><br/>Total time: ~45 minutes. I did all the searching and encounter constructing while writing this post, and it took me 20 minutes. I just need to tweak the monsters in the Monster Builder, scaling their levels so that they are appropriate. This dungeon is currently a bit of a hero killer, but maybe that's okay given my design goals.<br/><br/>Encounters 3 and 5 are really awesome.<br/>I love the Tiefling and Pain Devil, in repose upon a bed of skulls, their Vile Pet spewing and mewing in the corner.<br/>The heroes burst in, and they look over, more annoyed than alarmed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241878/#Comment_241878" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-13T11:19:48+00:00" title="November 13, 2009 11:19AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, what's important about that whole process:<br/>The heroes are constructed from about 6 different books (PHB, PHB2, Forgotten Realms, Martial Power, Divine Power, Arcane Power).<br/>The monsters are taken from about 6 sources (Monster Manual, Monster Manual 2, Exemplars of Evil, some other ones).<br/>The monsters are a pastiche of levels: 3,4,6,11,12,13.<br/><br/>To have designed this by hand would have been quite unwieldy.<br/>Character creation would have taken hours (Or, more realistically, I would have restricted my sources and limited options).<br/>I'd never have found all of those monsters.<br/>I'd not have been able to tweak them to be more-or-less level appropriate.<br/><br/>Not only was it faster, but it enabled me to work with whatever material I felt like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241879/#Comment_241879" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-13T11:26:57+00:00" title="November 13, 2009 11:26AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Plus now I want to play that.

The programs automatcially figure the pluses and minuses in. I'm not certain how it effects making up your own monsters. You say they have a monster builder? So I could make up the dreaded Chuck-a-Muck? Do they have a trap builder?

(and I don't have any special kung fu for the Compendium ones, I just edit the HTML and add a link to a css stylesheet I've hand-coded for Compendium prints.)<br/><br/>The Monster Creator actually produces very nice prints, although there's a hardcoded Wizards IP notification paragraph on the bottom that sometimes causes the print to span two cards, which is a pain in the ass.  <br/><br/>I hear you about the Character Creator prints.  I wish there was a simple way to select a different character sheet for printed output, so you didn't have to use that ugly-ass IRS 1040HATE output style.

I googled around for this but no one's stepped up and offered a recipe to do this.<br/><br/>The Character Creator files appear to be plain XML, so it might be possible to throw some xslt at them and transform them into non-hateful PDF or HTML/CSS.  Alas, the full text of the powers isn't within the xml file, only a url to a Wizards web service, so whatever you did would also have to hit the Wizards service to get the complete power data for print.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241891/#Comment_241891" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-13T13:43:00+00:00" title="November 13, 2009  1:43PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 13, 2009 1:43PM by sage.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course, once you mentioned characters being XML I remembered seeing a web-page (phone oriented) that let you upload characters and display them, so there's at least a proof of concept. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I'm not the person to do it (my layout skills suck, even if the coding should be simple enough), but I don't see why it couldn't be done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pjack" title="Pjack"><img alt="Pjack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pjack">Pjack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241892/#Comment_241892" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-13T13:51:27+00:00" title="November 13, 2009  1:51PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>Anyway, to stay on topic: johnzo, how are you fitting in your own style sheet?
