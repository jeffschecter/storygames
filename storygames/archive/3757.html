I want a game about easy choices. Choices where one option is simply, clearly better than the other option. Like those crappy feats that no one ever takes.<br/><br/>With that in mind, I give you: Twelve Dollars or a Punch in the Face<br/><br/>1) You play the game.<br/>2) When you get to a conflict, either the GM pays you twelve dollars or gives you a punch in the face. Your choice.<br/>3) Then you keep playing the game.<br/>4) Play until at least two people need to go to the emergency room, or are broke.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84220/#Comment_84220" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T06:37:22+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  6:37AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2007 6:38AM by Andy.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the game Dread (the "First Book of Pandemonium" Dread), and am shaking at the knees until my copy is in my hands.<br/><br/>It is loaded with Easy Choices.<br/><br/>GM: "There are signs that at that abandoned factory warehouse over there, yeah the one with the skinheads patrolling it with shotguns?

It seems like a kind of Lego-set for adults, where you keep adding up cool, creative ideas into new combinations.  But there's strategy involved in terms of, you know, winning -- so it's a game.<br/><br/>What I'm curious about is the notion the Players make a "thematic statement."

You sure?  I thought we lost you long before I started in on <em>Sons of Liberty</em>...<br/><br/>The 'thematic statement' that comes out of <em>SoL</em> is embedded in how you portray these legends of history, what emphasis you put on them, how they approach problems, and indeed, what they see as a problem and what they don't.  It comes out in how you articulate the game objectives, and what you present as acceptable solutions to those objectives.  Because the game mechanics just tell you if you win or lose; they don't say what that means -- that's something that the players all create in the game.<br/><br/>...but that makes the game sound really heavy and serious, which it really, really isn't.  It's much more like, say, <em>Monty Python's Life of Brian</em> commenting on religion: it's fun and funny, but that doesn't make it any less a commentary on religion.<br/><br/>Ben, yeah, I can concur with the "what's next?" thing, which is why I have lots and lots of mechanical guidance for "what's next" which allows the players to, lego-like, choose which flavor of awesome they want to contribute.  So you look at your hand and see that you have a 2 of Hearts, a 3 of Clubs, and a 5 of Hearts, you just need a 4, but then your sheet says you can claim a joker when you're using electricity, so you narrate how Ben Franklin picks up the lightning rod from the collapsed building (thus getting your joker) and throws it harpoon-like into the menacing British zeppelin (playing the Hearts for patriotism and martial prowess), thus channeling lightning from the storm into the airship (playing the clever Club card).  Which may sound complicated, but the game is really just prompting you: do something with electricity, that's heroic, and is kind of clever.  Players, I find, have no problem taking it from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85002/#Comment_85002" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-02T11:28:24+00:00" title="August  2, 2007 11:28AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>I love the game Dread (the "First Book of Pandemonium" Dread), and am shaking at the knees until my copy is in my hands.</blockquote>\nHeh.
