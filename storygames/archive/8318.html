Let's call her A. We are running into a problem around character control. That is, A is allergic to any mechanic that takes her character in any way out of her control.<br/><br/>I've tried a number of things. I have tried "going soft" on the narrative by describing mind or emotion influencing magic (or just plain old persuasiveness on the part of an NPC) in compelling terms but not actually dictating her character's actions, and this is enough - sometimes. I have tried suggesting incentive mechanics like those found in <i>Spirit of the Century</i>, <i>Houses of the Blooded</i>, and <i>Weapons of the Gods</i>, but these don't seem to do it for her. Predictably, A is also allergic to social mechanics (because they allow the rules to abridge her control of her character).<br/><br/>I'd rather not try to describe A in every way possible, so how about we make this a conversation? You can make suggestions and ask questions, and I'd be happy to answer questions and comment on your suggestions. Any and all advice is welcome, from "try this tactic" to "try this game."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183508/#Comment_183508" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-15T14:32:32+00:00" title="December 15, 2008  2:32PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well...why not play games where control of her character is absolute?

Firstly, I consider myself a decent actor, but sometimes I want to portray an NPC of superlative sneakiness. Sometimes I want to be able to talk my player(s) into doing something stupid without having to concoct every plot with the assumption that the players will always make the right choices at every juncture, which would necessitate me creating incredibly convoluted Xanatos Gambits out of every scheme. Sure, I can count on A to sometimes make poor choices purely in character (though, honestly, not often), but sometimes I want to push her in the direction of making a specific poor choice.<br/><br/>Not that I want to railroad her. I don't want this to be my only tactic, just one of many.<br/><br/>Secondly, many, many fantasy tropes go right out the window if I can never use mind or emotion control. There are several games I can't play at all, or games where huge chunks of setting and system become unusable, if I can never employ anything involving mind or emotion control.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183531/#Comment_183531" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-15T15:43:42+00:00" title="December 15, 2008  3:43PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark,<br/><br/>when in a situation like this, I really only see two possible healthy results: \n<ul>\n<li>You play games that match both of your needs;<br/></li>\n<li>You find other people to play with.</li>\n</ul>\nIt's possible, of course, to do a mix and match as well. You can play games that A enjoys and you enjoy with A, and then with others play the games you want to play that A doesn't.<br/><br/>What isn't really available as a healthy option though is to play games that either of you wouldn't enjoy.<br/><br/>To be honest, I sympathise with A. The GM controls everything except the character in many traditional games. The non-GM controls only the character. If the non-GM doesn't get to control the character, they have zero say whatsoever in the fiction.<br/><br/>What happens when the two of you play games that lack GMs (like <i>Breaking the Ice</i>)? Or games that distribute narrative authority differently (like, well I want to say <i>InSpectres</i>, but I don't think it would scale well to two-players, so pick a two-player game with GM with that level of narrative authority placed in the non-GMs hands)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183554/#Comment_183554" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-15T17:10:19+00:00" title="December 15, 2008  5:10PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 15, 2008 5:11PM by JDCorley.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My suggestion would be to collaborate with her on what decisions you want her character to make. Say (perhaps outside of the view of other players) "Hey, I've got this cool idea for X that might happen if your character does Y. What do you think might be a cool way for her to end up doing Y?"<br/><br/>I see this as connected to something I've heard several actors say on TV DVD commentary tracks. When playing a character over a long period of time, it is a giant trap to say "Oh, but my character would never do action Z." Eventually the list of things your character would not do subsumes anything they might possibly do. What the actors (and writers) try to do is to address "Under what circumstances would my character do action Z when normally they never ever would even consider it."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183570/#Comment_183570" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-15T18:20:29+00:00" title="December 15, 2008  6:20PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have had similar experiences with players who absolutely detest any mechanic that takes away their choice of what their PC does.  In this case a vampire's mind control wouldn't offend them, but suggesting someone was so clever and persuasive that they were conned into a bad choice would offend them.  Myself, I see no difference between these really - the Vampire with magical domination ability vs the NPC with +10000 to Persuasive Skill - but others see a yawning chasm between them.<br/><br/>I've tried exploring that, explaining that heroes in narratives make bad choices all the time, fall for lies, are deceived etc.   I've explained my own puzzlement that if NPC's are subject to PC's social skills why are PC's immune to NPC's social skills?  Why does that dragon have that great diplomacy skill?  That you don't decide whether or not your character was fast enough to duck that shot, there's a rules mechanic for it.  Similarly, why decide if your character is clear-eyed enough to never spend longer than they should drinking in the bar the night before the mission etc. or close-mouthed enough to never let the wrong thing slip when kissing persuasive lips.<br/><br/>But no amount of discussion, showing different systems, promising that "it's not about changing core beliefs/attitudes/goals" got around that - it was a very ingrained thing which was indeed "find a way to play respecting that or don't play with that person".  The dragon's great diplomacy skill means it has allies and servants and many people don't think it's evil, it affects the PC's in these ways, not in convincing them of anything the Player doesn't want the PC convinced about.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_183604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183604/#Comment_183604" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-16T00:59:29+00:00" title="December 16, 2008 12:59AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about playing some games where the player has more control over everything?

For example, say an NPC makes a successful Diplomacy (or similar) check against the PC.  The PC can start being more friendly toward the NPC, or she can just take a -2 to all rolls and checks regarding that NPC (or even that situation).  That way, the player doesn't have to lose control of her character, but that NPC's power is still felt.<br/><br/>I know some games do this, but I can't remember which.
