                    Quite a few of the threads I've read here lately have taken aim at traditional RPGs, and there's a lot that goes on in the Narr scene which seems to be a direct rebellion against RPGs-as-was.  Getting rid of the GM, getting rid of characters, funky authorial controls, minimalist game design ... etc.  <i>Gamist</i> is almost a perjorative term - I almost expect to see the words 'You fucking ...' in front of it whenever it's used.<br/><br/>But I think that in the process, I think that the strengths of the <i>game</i> part of Story Games is getting chucked out the window as well.  As far as I'm concerned, RPGs work best when they skate the line between game and story - between collective enterprise and competitive.  I wonder if maybe something is getting lost when the gut reaction to anything that may have appeared in an RPG prior to 1995 is to burn it to the ground.<br/><br/>Granted, I think that RPGs as an object-class are well represented, and that there are a lot of gameforms out there left to be explored.  But I also think that it's wise from a couple of different viewpoints to keep the touchstones of the past in mind - certainly not every single aspect of traditional RPGs is worthy of scorn.                </div>

                            I tend to agree.<br/>
<br/>
For myself, the character sheet for my game is littered with dots and checkboxes and categories of stuff. Most of it is traditionally hidden-in-the-back stuff in most RPGs; you don't normally track things like hunger, thirst, and your need for approval on your sheet.  But it's all still very much *game* stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I think a good synthesis between game and story can be great.  Maybe I won't be the one to get it, but I'm trying.                        </div>

<br/>
I mean, yeah, I see threads talking about getting rid of GMs, characters, etc. but I haven't seen any of those that imply that other methods are wrong. And who's dissin' on the gamist vibe? I don't see it. Forget babies. I don't see any bathwater a-flyin.<br/>

Being excited about something is not the same thing as scorn for something else. Maybe we're reading different things.                        </div>

                            Yeah, I agree with John: I'm not seeing what you're seeing.  I saw the "What 10 year-old or older games do you still sometimes play", where a lot of people said they didn't play games from 10 years or more anymore... but I think it's a huge leap from there to wanting to burn it all down.<br><br>A couple more things:<br><br><i>Gamist is almost a perjorative term</i>&lt;-- Here, I really want to see where you're seeing this. Seriously, I need to see some evidence here that this isn't something that's only going on in your head.  Because most of these highfalutin' concept games that I'm seeing these days with less authoritorial control, no/multiple GMs, etc are MUCH more gamey than traditional games, IMO.  The Shab al-Hiri Roach, for example, a recent forum favorite, complete with simple character sheets (actually, Levi's character sheet for Pulse looks a lot like Roach, IMO, just with more circles) and no GM, wraps up with a board game: Betting, resource management (be it coins, poker chips, dots on a character sheet, etc), and finally: A WINNER of the game. Heck, even Polaris is all about gamist conflict: Not with using dice and checks on character sheets, but with using arguments and words (and recording wins and losses on your sheet as if you were tracking verbal "hit points") to battle other players like MtG folks battle each other with cards.<br/><br/>Another example: Bacchanal by Paul Czege; Looks like a sit-back-and-talk froo-froo game with dice and stuff.  Turns out to be a very complicated (at first) narration game with definite gamey bits, where the dice themselves are substituted for all the boxes and stats on the character sheet: One color of d4 represents X, another Y, the d6s represent Z, one player controls the d8 to do AA, another controls the d10 to do AB, etc.<br/><br/>In fact, when I talk to people about the game that I'm working on with the traditional Forge crewboys, discussion QUICKLY turns to gamist-related observations and the like: "What rules do you have in place to ensure X happens? What resources do you have to mitigate player/character conflicts?" etc. In fact, games &lt;i&gt;without a gamist bent, from simple systems like The Window to many of those free-form French games, to most traditional RPGs being released these days with no clear gamist goals seem to get the upturned nose.  <br/><br/>Thinking on it a little, I think that's a lot of reason behind a lot of the blogsphere discussion on "Immersionism": A lot of folks just can't see any gamism underneath the sheets, and that confuses them and makes them ask, "What's the point? Is this a game or just some acting exercise?"<br/><br/>Seriously, I'm just not seeing what you're seeing: Not to shut you down or anything, but I'd really like to see concrete examples of what you're talking about: Feel free to link or make examples of games and the like (everyone here would be totally cool with that, even if you're linking to stuff someone said or games someone wrote), it's all about the discussion and not about bickering, I promise.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>ps, I've always been fond of the expression, "Throwing the Baby out with the Soup"...                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<p>I just sorta wanted to note that, while the factors are related, I think the nose-upturning tends to be toward games that don't have resource-and-reward patterns clearly tuned toward a specific kind of play, rather than games that fail to have opportunities to display your gamey mastery.</p>

We can start there, certainly.  <br/><br/>I'm having a hard time formulating exactly what I want to get at ... how about: "What are the possible applications of feats/stunts/charms/spell lists/tech trees/equipment lists/to-hit tables to narrativist games?"                        </div>

                            Because crunchy bits are fun.<br/>
<br/>
The Shadow of Yesterday is a delightful franken-game and one of the cool parts of it is the Secrets, which are more or less Feats with a twist.<br/>
<br/>
All of the crunchy bits you mention, what is their application to narrativist games:<br/>
<br/>
They can be fun.  Fun to tinker with, fun to earn, fun to add to the character, fun to use in an epic battle.                        </div>

I'm going to have to print off TSoY again - I read it once, and y'all refer to it a lot here, and I don't have it memorized.<br/><br/>Ok - I see what you're saying here, and I think that Secrets in TSoY probably fulfill this next question, and so my next question is:<br/><br/>What are the <i>narrativist equivalents</i> to feats, et alia?<br/>Where/what is the <i>narrative crunch</i>?                        </div>

<p>All the advanced <em>key phrases</em> in Polaris (everything that isn't <em>but only if</em>, <em>it was not meant to be</em> and <em>and that was how it happened</em>) are basically feats of the "improved sunder" sort -- they let you do something that you could do anyway much better.  For a while, I considered having them only become available slowly, like class features in D&amp;D.  In the end, I decided that this made the game more complicated than I was willing to deal with.</p>

<p>Okay, Kuma, I am, like, a <em>poster child</em> for the unwise discarding of tradition that (I think) you are perceiving.  I will go on record saying that I very much do perceive that attitude in my own design, and that I've been thinking about it recently.</p>
<p>When I look at (oh, say, not-at-all-randomly) the role of the GM from first principles, I conclude that there are lots of different ways to structure that power.  It's about pacing, and adversity, and all that what-not.  You can give the responsibility for doing those things to one person, or you can do something else (like Capes's competition to be the one to do it best, Polaris's breaking into ritualized structure, Breaking the Ice's conflation of adversity with the enticing other, etc.)</p>
<p>So I ran ahead, like every innovator who ever discarded tradition as the meaningless constraint of the small-minded.  People were clinging to the GM role even in places where it <em>wasn't the best solution</em>, because they are hide-bound and ignorant, and don't want to consider new possibilities.</p>
<p>I really needed to do that.  It felt good.  Got that out of my system.</p>
<p>But when I think about it without that prejudice, I realize that tradition <strong>is its own justification</strong>.  Human beings <em>want</em> to create some traditions.  In a world where there are many, many possible solutions to any given problem, they want to use the solution that they have used before, not because it's the globally best solution, but because their familiarity with it, their confidence in it, will <strong>make it</strong> the best solution for them.</p>
<p>Sometimes:  "Good enough solution" + "Power of tradition" &gt; "Perfect solution"</p>
<p>Now that I know I <em>can</em> toss tradition out the window if I want to, suddenly I don't want to any more.  I want to take advantage of the ways that I know people are comfortable playing, to make a game that's easier for them to pick up and run with.  Yeah, a GM may not be the globally ideal structure for (say) <em>Misery Bubblegum</em>, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to have one, and that it's going to look very familiar to people who come straight from D&amp;D.  It's a touchstone that I consciously give them ... a tool of communication, me to them, them to me.</p>
<p>Tradition has a unique and powerful strength, and I know that as a designer I got so fascinated by the fact that I didn't <em>need</em> it that I totally overlooked the idea that I might <em>want</em> it.  Not gonna make that mistake twice.  If I write another game that discards RPG tradition, I'm going to do it consciously, because I get something from ignoring tradition which is more important that what I get from embracing it.</p>

As the originator of that particular thread, lemme comment.<br/><br/>Dude, that doesn't mean we hate gamist games. It doesn't mean we hate 10+ year-old rulesets. Hell, it doesn't mean we hate narrative games though you could have assumed in that direction, but didn't.<br/><br/>It just means that it'd be a terrible mix. <br/><br/>I love chocolate.

                            Okay, so I read Tony's post and I think "that's awesome!" but I also think there are good reasons that other designers aren't necessarily following the same path, experimenting with crazy weird stuff and then pulling back to more conservative design schemes.<br/><br/>Yes, sometimes designers ditch roleplaying's tradition and don't really replace it with anything.  This can result in games that are rather hollow, stripped of all familiarity and thus really difficult to grok and play.<br/><br/>However, roleplaying's traditions are not the only traditions available.  This, to me, is really, REALLY important and one of the critical components of my own design philosophy.  <br/><br/>If you look solely at roleplaying for design inspiration, you're going to be able to remix old mechanics indefinitely and play with whatever hot stuff just flowed out of the heads of guys like Steve Kenson, Robin Laws, Rebecca Borgstrom, Vincent Baker, folks like that.  Sure you can come up with a dozen neat new dice mechanics that nobody's ever thought of before.  And some of them might be pretty damn cool.<br/><br/>However, you have so many more choices at your fingertips if you consider <i>traditions outside of roleplaying</i>.  Just because these are not roleplaying's traditions does not make them alien to your audience.  Roleplayers participate in other aspects of creative life and so are also the heirs to many, many other traditions in literature, art, film, theater, sports, other types of games, politics, philosophy, oral storytelling, myth, etc.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I agree with Tony that tradition certainly has it's place.  People need the familiar, the comfortable, but this doesn't necessarily have to be dice and GMs and maps and character sheets and numerical traits and the like.  <br/><br/>In fact, if part of your intended audience is people who have never been hardcore roleplayers, <i>these are not their traditions at all</i>, they're alien invaders from another planet.  Traditionally, people have said "roleplaying is like storytelling" or "roleplaying is like a board game" in order to appeal to the traditions of these people.  <br/><br/>However, I find it more interesting, in my own design work, to include enough material from traditions outside roleplaying that both hardcore roleplayers and people who approach my games from a different standpoint will find enough common ground to reach a necessary level of comfort and familiarity.<br/><br/>So yeah.  That was long-winded.  I hope there's something worthwhile in all that.                        </div>

<blockquote>However, roleplaying's traditions are not the only traditions available. This, to me, is really, REALLY important and one of the critical components of my own design philosophy.</blockquote>
Actually, I think this is probably one of the most ... not "important", but "weighty"(?) ideas that's been spinning around in the last few months of the gamethoughtverse.  It'll still be about 1-2 years (skipping straight over Polaris) until we see some a game that:<br/><br/>1) Maximizes outside-gaming influences.<br/>2) Remains playable.<br/>3) Is fun and easy to learn.<br/><br/>But once we do... hot damn.  This isn't "wishes", either: I'm seeing some of these games being built right now around me. Heck, I'm even building one, sorta, that basically steals a resource management manager-training tool and drafts it into a roleplaying mechanic (small world: That tool was developed by a company that Steffan O'Sullivan aka The Fudgeman used to work for).<br/><br/>But I'd love to see more stuff brought in, and used in an even more hardcore fasion.                        </div>

                            For what it's worth, one of my own projects for later this year is specifically intended to draw on what I know about good gaming but not to look or sound like an RPG, so as to reach a different audience. It'll be intresting to see how it turns out.                        </div>

                            Hi Kuma!<br/>
  Yeah, I got that vibe too, when I first started reading some of this innovative design stuff. But then I realized, it's not about "dissing" the old school routines, it was about challenging others to innovate.<br/>
  What did old school games get right?<br/>
D&amp;D -What is roleplaying? Why do I keep playing (to get levles of course!)?<br/>
Gurps - No levels still equals fun. It's OK to be a little realistic<br/>
White Wolf - It's OK to be different<br/>
  Is that the kind of stuff you are looking for? I can go into more detail, I just don't want to ramble on in the wrong direction, lol<br/>
