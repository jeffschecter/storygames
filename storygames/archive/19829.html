Any comments will be welcome!<br/><br/>They are available here: <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/139072/AW-playbooks-the-Giant-and-the-Little-Kid" rel="nofollow">http://www.rpgnow.com/product/139072/AW-playbooks-the-Giant-and-the-Little-Kid</a> <br/><br/>The objective of the playbooks is two have two characters strongly connected from the start: the Giant is very strong, but definitely needs the Little Kid guidance. At the beginning of the game it will be interesting to see how the two of them, that need each other, can pursue their personal agendas. During the game they will have the chance to grow apart and separate: you'll play to find out if there will be a conflict, a natural separation, a renewing of this bond or whatever else...<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.rpgnow.com/images/5383/139072.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
