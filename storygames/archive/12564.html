Will you choose love, power, religion, allegiance, war, or betrayal?<br/><br/>Hero\u2019s Banner: The Fury of Free Will is a fantasy roleplaying game with a razor sharp premise and elegant mechanics to match. Every character is faced with a choice between three mutually exclusive and world-changing paths to glory. Which will he choose, and what will he forever give up to achieve his goals?<br/><br/>What\u2019s more, Hero\u2019s Banner supports multi-generational epic play. Each character is designed to last a single session. But the game can go on forever as you link one character to the next in a chain of heroes, each one idolizing the previous.</i><br/><br/>You might be balancing your Loyalty to the Throne, your Family Oath, and your personal desire to Marry Jezebel.<br/>The game is about making those choices, and struggling with both power &amp; responsibility.<br/><br/>And then you choose. And your hero becomes legend for their choice.<br/>...and you begin to play someone who grew up idolizing your past character.<br/>Maybe a protege, or a lieutenant, or a follower, or a fan.<br/><br/>Generational roleplaying where decisions and loyalties hang in the balance!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282022/#Comment_282022" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-21T00:23:01+00:00" title="July 21, 2010 12:23AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: weaverchilde</cite>I am looking for a game that handles social obligation in a mechanical way.

(This is how I like to play 1-shots, at least: you tell the players before character creation that "This is a town about blood and sex" or "This is a town about money and family", so they construct characters who will mesh well with that. In this case, there's no reason for the GM to say it first, if there's time for everyone to know.

I'll start trying to play them all (I think there is a Go Play in my area soon, I am sure I can get something going there) and I'll throw out some narrowing factors:<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers will take the role of young nobles in a society of Sorcerous Hunter/Kings. Personal renown is based on magical prowess (mainly in the form of spirit deals and construct creation), hunting ability (which is used as a metaphor for many things in life), and finally the mastery of a craft skill (which feeds back into family and society prestige).  Magic needs to be an Art not a science. Family status is about your skill for gaining more family prestige in the empire (i.e. craft skill), how big your family is, a. Imperial duty is the final area of obligation, so being responsible for some role (tax collectors, magistrate, etc\u2026 typically jobs people will dislike you for doing), undertaking the warpath (which are special ops missions into enemy territory - basically a way to get players to engage in warfare and more action orient scenes), and managing the lands granted to you by the empire (ie. Getting your tribute taken care). <br/>\n<br/>\nI need a way to mechanize a Gift Economy system, so some way of investing importance into a gift. I was thinking that a gift could have a beanie of some sort in it invested in it, maybe a way for players to trade them by giving gifts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like some mechanical way of emulating the ebb and flow of tracking for a hunt (actually thought of Battle of Wits via Burning Wheel here, but that is more \u2018scripted\u2019 than I was hoping for). This may be something for other conflicts as well\u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe I ask too much                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282371/#Comment_282371" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T08:55:47+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  8:55AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you were to do this with TSOY, gifts would be portable Secrets (Imbuement if they have mechanical effects).

Mechanically, you spend wealth to increase your abilities (number of dice you can roll when using that thing), and you are limited in how many dice you can use per 'round' or 'exchange' or whatever by how many wealth you currently have. So it's useful both to spend and to hoard, hopefully creating some tension. Some of the other game mechanics are also based on player negotiations, usually involving trading wealth as in fiction gifts. Dunno if that goes anywhere near what you're talking about, Jason's modifications to TSOY sound like a really cool way to go, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282613/#Comment_282613" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-23T09:51:16+00:00" title="July 23, 2010  9:51AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>The very best research you can possibly do is to play these games, preferably with people who know them well.
