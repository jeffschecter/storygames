I am an old man gamer (37) who was raised on Errol Otus-cover D&amp;D and although I have not played for a looooooong time I have kept up with what games are like in this modern age. My mind was, it's fair to say, blown when I found out a little about 'story games'/narrative games as it seemed the kind of approach I'd always been looking for many years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I have a question about 'modern' games. I'm looking to try something as a re-entry into actually playing. Can anyone recommend me a story game that will help me understand and have fun using these new concepts for me?  I want a game where character death is NOT an issue. I always thought when I started playing, if I'm trying to emulate Sword and Sorcery fiction, why is there a chance my PC could die? I want a game that is explicit in saying no, your character won't die unless it's crucial to the story. I'm also looking for a game with a system which helps me to set stakes - what I want is for the characters in the game to risk things all the time - to have consequences for their actions, to have to accept complications when they are involved in struggles - but not have to risk the death of the characters - to have other things which make the play interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm especially looking for a game that will work well with 'heroic' fantasy, sword and sorcery, Robert E Howard-type material. Where do you think would be a good place to start and will ease me in gently? I am quite happy with the idea of ditching my traditional-game methods of playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have thought about using The Pool, but thought I might need something a bit more structured to start with. I'm not sure that I fully understand how it works when there seems to be no way for the GM to introduce conflicts. This may be a very basic thing I have missed but as an example, I imagine playing The Pool: there's the antagonist - the NPC - the GM describes him jumping out and attacking the PCs - but I'm not clear does the GM make rolls for the NPC? Does everything come from the players - I mean all the initiation of conflict? Does the GM describe a situation and the rolls to decide the outcome only made by the players? I just don't see how this is handled in the Pool where it seems everything comes from the players and the rolls they alone make. This is the type of thing I'm unsure about, and why I was perhaps looking for a game with a structure and systems closer to what I would describe as a traditional game, or shoudl I just say to hell with it and try something very different?<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this does not sound too clueless and that someone has a suggestion for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nRichard                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164880/#Comment_164880" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T04:18:46+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  4:18AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd recommend reading Dogs in the Vineyard to just anybody who comes from a gaming background.

I suspect you'll get a lot of wildly different suggestions in this thread, which is all to the good.  Pick and choose and check stuff out for yourself.<br/><br/>Based on what you've written I'd suggest taking a look at <a href="http://crngames.com/the_shadow_of_yesterday/" rel="nofollow">The Shadow of Yesterday</a>, which seems to meet most of your checklist.  It's an excellent game that is unapologetically traditional in some ways, and a little radical in others.  You can set death as the possible outcome of a conflict, but it is always an explicit and meaningful choice.  It's very <i>human</i>, if that makes sense, so playing truly superheroic dudes isn't its forte.  It's highly player-driven and very, very fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164890/#Comment_164890" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T06:03:11+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  6:03AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I second Primetime Adventures.

I've run or played in something like 3 full seasons/campaigns, a number of mini-campaigns, and a bunch of one-shots, and it's *very* rare that a session is dull when everyone is invested. It's also easy to find or make players for this game. <br/><br/>From there, you can decide if you want to descend deeper into the patchouli-oil-and-dreadlock abyss of games like My Life with Master, or stick with games that bridge the two worlds like Dust Devils.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Morten%20Greis" title="Morten Greis"><img alt="Morten Greis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Morten%20Greis">Morten Greis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164902/#Comment_164902" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T06:59:01+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  6:59AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So far I agree with people here: In a Wicked Age, The Shadow of Yesterday (but go for Eero's version: Solar System - very useful, in general I recommend reading it, because there is lot of good advice here), Primetime Adventures and Dogs in the Vineyard.

It has all the features you requested, plus, as a bonus, you can read it online for free, just follow my link to the wiki (you can also, if you want, read it and pay for it).<br/><br/><i>Primetime Adventures</i> can also do the same thing for you. However, it would be Sword and Sorcery as seen through the lens of the telly. The stories will be structured like what you would expect from an ensemble cast serial program. <br/><br/>Some of the other games suggested come close. <i>In a Wicked Age</i> has Sword and Sorcery, but it has no stake setting (and will break if you try to use it that way) and probably won't feature meaningless death. Nobody mentioned it, but <i>Sorcerer and Sword</i> will feature the same qualities as In a Wicked Age. And <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> will feature stakes setting, no meaningless death, but isn't Sword and Sorcery.<br/><br/>Now here's the thing, <i>The Pool</i> will also do what you want (minus the stakes setting), so do you want answers to your questions regarding it? Because, I think, if you're playing these games with friends of yours, things will go wrong initially. I can almost guarantee it (not just with <i>The Pool</i>, mind, but with any of these games). Just like things went wrong the first time you played Basketball, the first time you drove, the first time you did anything. But if all of you are walking in saying, "hey, this will not be perfect the first time we play, but we'll get better over time," then I don't see why a game like <i>The Pool</i> shouldn't work for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164924/#Comment_164924" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T08:57:57+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  8:57AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, <em>Primetime Adventures</em> is the hands-down best introduction to indieland out there.

Different suggestions:<br/>\n1) HQ - This supports good Nar style and its hard to die if you save your Hero Points for those critical situations<br/>\n2) SoY - I love this game. It's hard to die, but it can happen.<br/>\n3) PTA - PTA is a great game, because play is about the story, and not about whether you can get a critical hit.<br/>\n4) Donjon - In this game, players have a 1 in 6 chance of adding a secret door to the dungeon, not a 1 in 6 chance of finding one if one exists. I dunno the lethality level though...<br/>\n5) Otherkind - This has an interesting way of dividing control over outcome and narrative authority.<br/>\n6) Trollbabe - Any failed roll can be re-rolled, but you have to risk something you love.ii So, you can't die, unless its not worth what you would lose if you re-rolled and failed...<br/>\n  As you can see, what you asked for can be re-interpretted in different ways depending on what you really want.<br/>\n  Good luck man!<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pandelume" title="Pandelume"><img alt="Pandelume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pandelume">Pandelume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164950/#Comment_164950" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T11:37:55+00:00" title="August 25, 2008 11:37AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you very much for all these suggestions. I have an idea that we will probably try Primetime Adventures at least for some experimentation with this type of game, though I am looking for something specificially tied to sword and sorcery. I also like the comment about Trollbabe mechanics - this is exactly the kind of thing I was thinking about when I mentioned setting stakes - risking something you love or that is important. I definately want the focus to be on the story and what happens as a result of the violence, rather than what effects violence has on the person, if you know what I mean. I'm looking for an experience where conflict/fighting could be part of what is happening but is not the focus of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI intend to buy Shadow of Yesterday to read and play to get another angle on things. I'm not sure if this is just my uncertainty showing here, but at least to start with I would like to choose a game which is specifically designed for a sword and sorcery background. I have this feeling that say reading Dogs in the Vineyard would have it tied down to the original genre in my mind and I would be hard pushed to hack it and use the systems for my own genre and setting, as some people describe doing with various systems.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am interested in On Mighty Thews very much too and will have a read through that. On a very brief first glance that seemed to be very promising. I can see that there is quite a lot of choice. I stated that I was interested in games where character death was not an option, however as Rafu said, in On Mighty Thews there's no UNWILLING character death and I think that is what I was after. I'm quite happy for character death to take place if it makes sense in the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that I understand stake setting properly. What I am looking for is a game where stakes are explicitly set as part of the conflict resolution. In my imagination I have the idea that actions (large or small scale) will have immediate consequences attached to them so that a failure on a roll may or may not mean the characters don't manage to cross the rope bridge, but failure might mean they fall, but are hanging on by one hand, the natives arrive and start throwing spears at them, or high winds start blowing and make them hang on for dear life, or some other complication like that I want this as an integral part of the resolution system. I want situations where the characters have to make decisions that they care about - that is encouraged by the system. My idea is that, using combat as an example, the play would naturally make a combat into a story where players were describing their reactions to the consequences of their opponents actions rather than describing the physical damage. I hope that makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nChearns:<br/>\nI would be really grateful to have my questions on The Pool answered. I have read and really like this system - I like the idea of having to manage resources and gamble dice and the way the system seems to be more about manipulating the events of the narrative rather than about the personal actions of characters. It would seem to me that the players are more bidding for the right to tell the story than controlling a character - is that way off?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in, these are great ideas and have given me a list of options. What is worst in my position is choosing an appropriate starting point to make sense of it all so all these ideas are gratefully recieved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164969/#Comment_164969" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T12:09:00+00:00" title="August 25, 2008 12:09PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Otherkind </i>was mentioned above and has stakes setting and no death except if a player chooses so.  It actually fits the description of what you desire pretty well: players outline what they want to do and establish some negative outcomes that could happen (whether they succeed or not).  Dice are rolled, then assigned to the different outcomes: putting a high die in the general success category means achieving your goal.  Or you could put it towards avoiding one of the negative consequences.  But you have to choose which is more valuable to you and your character (and what's a more interesting story and such).<br/><br/>It's also a heroic fantasy game, but much less swords and sorcery and more romantic fantasy (or some other fantsy subgenre).

It is REALLY hard to kill PCs in SOY. And you can't kill an NPC by accident. You have to BDTP and state you want to kill them.<br/>\n  One thing I like about SOY that I haven't seen much anywhere else is Keys. Keys are a feature of character design. And they determine how your character gets XPs. So, if one players is a hack and slasher, he can take Key of Bloodlust or whatever and get XPs for fighting. And if you want to play the good guy, you can take Key of Compassion, etc. And you can change keys in mid campaign (even mid scene). So, if your character's personality/motivation changes, its not a problem.<br/>\n  There are other elements of the design of SOY that I love, and if you are interested, I can go into more detail, but this is already kind of a long post and you already said you would check it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Oh, and what Matt said...<br/>\n  Good luck getting your game together.<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165760/#Comment_165760" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-27T12:24:45+00:00" title="August 27, 2008 12:24PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2008 12:26PM by chearns.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Pandelume</cite> This may be a very basic thing I have missed but as an example, I imagine playing The Pool: there's the antagonist - the NPC - the GM describes him jumping out and attacking the PCs - but I'm not clear does the GM make rolls for the NPC? Does everything come from the players - I mean all the initiation of conflict? Does the GM describe a situation and the rolls to decide the outcome only made by the players? I just don't see how this is handled in the Pool where it seems everything comes from the players and the rolls they alone make. This is the type of thing I'm unsure about, and why I was perhaps looking for a game with a structure and systems closer to what I would describe as a traditional game, or shoudl I just say to hell with it and try something very different?</blockquote>\nHey, I was hoping someone else would pick that up, because I'm no expert on <i>The Pool</i>, but, uh, nobody did.<br/><br/>The only rollers are the non-GM players. The GM never rolls. However, should any player (GM or non-GM) feel that a conflict is under way, or would like to initiate a conflict, they can call for a roll. In your example with the NPC jumping out and attacking the PCs, that would be an instance of the GM calling for a conflict roll. <br/><br/>However, as you say, these are the <i>types</i> of things you are concerned about, indicating to me that you have quite a few other, unspoken, concerns regarding this game. My recommendation is, maybe read some actual play threads at The Forge about <i>The Pool</i>. They'll most likely give you a good idea of how to make the game sing, and hopefully also, indirectly, address a lot of your concerns. I would start here: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26528" rel="nofollow">[The Pool]</a>, and I'd draw your attention to Ron Edwards' posts as well as his links to other threads. I find he's particularly good at explaining how he plays <i>The Pool</i>. That being said, there's probably quite a bit of jargon being thrown around there, I'm not sure if it would be too much in order to understand the threads...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Pandelume</cite>I would be really grateful to have my questions on The Pool answered. I have read and really like this system - I like the idea of having to manage resources and gamble dice and the way the system seems to be more about manipulating the events of the narrative rather than about the personal actions of characters. It would seem to me that the players are more bidding for the right to tell the story than controlling a character - is that way off?</blockquote>\nEh, I think of it like most roleplaying games. The non-GMs have a character that they think of as theirs. They would use the Monologue of Victory to address the issue raised in their broadly stated intentions made before rolling. They may do this by introducing elements to the narrative, or they may do this by describing the results of the actions of their character. But in the end, I expect their focus to be on their character and what their intentions were for that roll. So, like, I wouldn't expect them to make themselves fail to obtain their intentions in a Monologue of Victory (nor would I expect intentions stated before rolling to be a failure for their character).<br/><br/>When I think of players bidding for the right to tell their story as opposed to controlling a character I think more of games like <i>Universalis</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pandelume" title="Pandelume"><img alt="Pandelume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pandelume">Pandelume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165946/#Comment_165946" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T11:28:23+00:00" title="August 28, 2008 11:28AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2008 11:29AM by Pandelume.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for that reply -<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had a look at a bunch of threads on The Forge (for example, http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=12802.0 which were very helpful. I have been somewhat scared of the Forge because of the Jargon etc - which is the original reason I have been lurking here, but the explanations in Actual Play threads, especially Ron Edwards comments, have been very helpful. AP threads really give me an insight into what people are doing when they play. The thread you linked to has also helped make it much clearer for me. The next thing is to actually get some games together which I think will help me sort some issues out with real play experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think The Pool would suit my desires well and I'm going to try running a game, along with experimenting with some of the systems suggested above. I'm really excited about trying these systems - I will play and then post back here about how it has gone.
