More accurately: "There are some definite benefits to leveling only impacting your character's combat prowess."<br/><br/>The D&amp;D paradigm is one equally frustrating and liberating. In every edition, characters are almost exclusively defined by their combat prowess. Hit dice, THAC0/attack bonus, saving throws, weapon and armor restrictions. Swathes of material was written and directed at the combat minigame: magical weapons and armor, spells, wondrous items, etc. Modern D&amp;D desperately seeks to break free from the wargame roots, the system is hamstrung by its emphasis on combat rules. The designers <i>want</i> D&amp;D to be a high fantasy storytelling engine, but character builds have a stranglehold over gameplay.<br/><br/>In "modern" editions of D&amp;D--and I use "modern" liberally--is the introduction of the skill system. Non-weapon proficiencies were changed from a side a l\xe1 carte to main course in 3.0, and they're gradually taking up more room on the plate: skill tricks, skill challenges, background skills, tool proficiencies. This torment offers not a moment of respite!<br/><br/>Most of all, it seems patently silly to me. Why does getting better at killing monsters--because modern D&amp;D is about setpiece fights--make a character better at public speaking? There are certainly justifications one can offer, but let us not dwell on those. Instead, I wish to discuss the merits of leveling up (lots of <i>a priori</i> assumptions here) as a method of increasing combat abilities only.<br/><br/>Traditional methods of leveling make a character more resilient in combat, mitigating risk when engaging physically. A level one character simply cannot fight a balor. He will be vaporized. By that same token, in a level-dependent skill system, a level one character cannot barter, negotiate, or persuade a balor with any real level of success. Taken to its extremes, a level one character must be incompetent in anything involving the task resolution system: crafting items, socializing, investigating, etc., so that the skills have "room to grow."<br/><br/>This likewise means that the people who are best at their craft are likewise only high-level adventurers, which is made all the more ridiculous. The local sage who possess a vast knowledge of the planar cosmology? The blacksmith whose weapons are renowned for their beauty? The manipulative vizier who whispers lies in the king's ear? All of them have 100 hit points and can kick your ass until you grind through the requisite number of quests to reach a high enough level to stand against them. (More assumptions! Bear with me.)<br/><br/>This is great if you're looking for the standard D&amp;D high fantasy romp, but it strikes me as overwhelmingly limited for characterization.<br/><br/>Instead, allowing characters to segregate fighting prowess from virtually every other aspect of characterization offers an opportunity to player characters who have an established history and background - and moreover, breaks free from the need to "level up" to have a character who can contribute to the game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464460/#Comment_464460" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-29T18:00:50+00:00" title="June 29, 2017  6:00PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes sense to me; this conflation of experience and hero status and combat prowess, if extended to the "world at large" has always ruined D&amp;D for me.<br/><br/>(When I play D&amp;D, it is only PCs who have "classes" and "levels" and gain "XP".

I used it for years with Burning Wheel and its related games, and I love it.<br/><br/>One of the things that happens is that characters are wholly shaped by their experiences, which is a blessing and a curse. If you're playing a game where the GM is providing pirate-and-sea-monster adventures, but you really want to be a necromancer, you can't do that with use-to-advance skills.  (I suspect this is more of a problem as kids.) You have to leave the ocean and go find some old tombs and graveyards. You <i>can</i> with class/level, because your development is insulated from the experiences of the game in a kind of "parallel play".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464495/#Comment_464495" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-30T12:52:02+00:00" title="June 30, 2017 12:52PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" rel="nofollow">Fuseboy</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>This is my favorite approach, and apparently it has a long history -- as far back as Call of Cthulhu. </p></div></blockquote>\n...as far back as Runequest actually.

If they are not talented, then only +4, since they only get +0 from ability modifier. Crafting a high-quality item is DC 15, so they can do that routinely (by taking 10). Crafting a masterwork item is DC 20 and requires several checks, so they might succeed, but it is not likely.<br/><br/>Your excellent first level smith has +4 from skill ranks, +4 from ability score and +3 from skill focus feat, for a total of +11. They can routinely create masterwork items.<br/><br/>(If they are a dwarf, they get an additional +2, and masterwork tools give an additional +2, for a total of +15. They always succeed at creating high-quality items, even under pressure where they can't take ten.)<br/><br/>The bonuses are similar for other skills, except humans may get +2 due to another feat and non-humans may get +1 or -1 depending on their ability score modifiers.<br/><br/>For Pathfinder, add +1 to +4 to the highest numbers you can reach; the characters are slightly more competent there.<br/><br/><br/>One has to make a number of assumptions, often violated by written adventures, for the world to remain sensible. First, pretty much everyone is first level. Second, even the most competent real life people can typically be modelled by characters of less than fifth level. My interpretation is that at around fifth level the characters become pulp heroes and at some very high level, maybe 10 or 15, they become demigods from Greek mythology. Heracles et al. Highly optimized characters reach the thresholds some levels earlier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464527/#Comment_464527" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-01T09:56:15+00:00" title="July  1, 2017  9:56AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The standard reference concerning realism of D&amp;D 3 is, for the record, the Alexandrian: <a href="http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/587/roleplaying-games/dd-calibrating-your-expectations-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/587/roleplaying-games/dd-calibrating-your-expectations-2</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shimrod" title="shimrod"><img alt="shimrod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shimrod">shimrod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464558/#Comment_464558" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-02T15:50:13+00:00" title="July  2, 2017  3:50PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Instead, allowing characters to segregate fighting prowess from virtually every other aspect of characterization offers an opportunity to player characters who have an established history and background - and moreover, breaks free from the need to "level up" to have a character who can contribute to the game.</p></div></blockquote>\nI'm not seeing what you're trying to achieve here, I guess?<br/><br/>Why do you want the 1st-level PC to be able to compete evenly with a 10th-level PC in a craftsmanship contest, or a court of law?

If you really don't want people gaining *new* skill proficiencies as they level up, or want them to only be able to do so through training, then don't let anyone play a Bard, and don't let anyone multi-class into Knowledge or Trickery Cleric. (Though, "don't let anyone multi-class, ever" is an excellent way to play 5E, and is certainly my policy.)<br/><br/>Sure, there is some non-combat improvement for everyone. But really, the fact that every *four* levels you get 5 percentage points better at all your trained skills (and only your trained skills, unlike in 4E) isn't all that absurd. If you've gained four levels, you've presumably used your skills under adverse circumstances quite frequently.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a beginner is quite competitive with someone further along in a straight opposed roll. Let's say the beginner has +3 to their stat and +2 for proficiency, and the 10th-level character has +5 to their stat (which is assuming it's their core stat\u2014not necessarily a given!) and +4 for proficiency. So there's only a 20% point difference between them--not trivial, but if the 1st level person can contrive to gain Advantage (or impose Disadvantage), the odds are essentially even.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464572/#Comment_464572" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-03T05:58:33+00:00" title="July  3, 2017  5:58AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now let's consider a few other examples, all in 5E.<br/><br/>1st level: skill untrained, and uses an off-stat (with a bonus of +0 or +1)<br/>10th level: ditto<br/><br/>Now they're equal!<br/><br/>1st: skill trained, and uses an off-stat--&gt;total bonus +2 or +3<br/>10th: ditto--&gt;total bonus +4 or +5<br/><br/>Hardly a devastating imbalance.<br/><br/>1st: skill trained, uses an off-stat--&gt;+2/+3<br/>10th: skill untrained, but uses their best stat--&gt;+4/+5<br/><br/>Same as above.<br/><br/>1st: skill trained, character is a Rogue and has invested Expertise in it, but it uses an off-stat--&gt;+5<br/>10th: skill trained but not Expertise, uses an off- or middling stat--&gt;+5/+6<br/><br/>Now, sure, there are lots of situations where the 10th level person is going to be much better at the task than the 1st level person... but almost all of those involve situations where the person who is better at the job is going to be better even when both characters are at the same level.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464573/#Comment_464573" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-03T10:37:46+00:00" title="July  3, 2017 10:37AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's straightforward to make D&amp;D do this thing, or not do this thing. Whether one should is an intensely interesting philosophical question for the design of a given D&amp;D variant, I think. There's good reasons to go either way.<br/><br/>I personally feel that 4th edition D&amp;D as a miniatures chess game should have a strict build barrier between a character's combat build and its non-combat features. The way the game's written, it's sort of half-way there, and taking it all the way wouldn't be that hard - I'm definitely doing that if and when I do something with 4th edition.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the concept of "combat" is not nearly as well-defined or important to some other varieties of D&amp;D, so the matter's not so clear-cut there. The sort of old-school-with-lotsa-rules D&amp;D I've been playing a lot wants to be agnostic about this matter, for example: the system does not know what is a "combat skill" and what is something else, it just lets the characters develop all sorts of amazing capabilities. Character level in this kind of D&amp;D doesn't represent their combat provess, but rather their "dramatic exceptionality": a 0-level character gets no leeway from the merciless cosmos while the more levels you have, the more stuff you can get away with. It depends on your character class what it is precisely that you're getting away with, but it's always going to be something romantic, adventurous, valiant, because that's what leveling measures. Probably not basket-weaving, except as some sort of magical specialty of an artificer wizard of some sort.<br/><br/>I personally feel that the class/level paradigm is so very overpowering as a conceptual focus that if you have it in the game, it needs to be front and center. And this means that if class/level is simply about combat (as in 4th ed), then the game needs to be predominantly about combat. If the game is about a wider set of concerns, then those concerns are what you want the classes and levels to address. A mis-match in this matter results in an ugly and mis-focused game, overall.<br/><br/>The way I cut this particular knot in my homebrew is with a robust skill system detached from the class/level paradigm, and the presumption that characters do not improve in various exotic skills simply by leveling, but that appropriate classes enable characters to specialize in skills if they want to. In practice this means that the local non-leveled blacksmith <i>will</i> be ridiculously better at it than a 5th level adventurer, <i>unless</i> the adventurer is also a blacksmith, in which case the odds are that he'll have more special crunch for blacksmithing than the civilian smith does, on top of a reasonable skill level. I think that this is a fine way to go in a traditional adventure D&amp;D - player characters should be able to shine as master smiths if that's what the players are into, but that should not happen by accident.<br/><br/>Anybody wanting to go that way in their treatments, I suggest doing something like this:<br/><b>*</b> Define a skill check that utilizes Ability scores and whatever sort of skill bonuses you prefer, but <b>don't</b> make the skill bonuses scale with level - so no skill points you get by leveling or anything like that.<br/><b>*</b> Whatever the skill factor in your skill checks is, make it something that is determined organically on the basis of the game fiction: to be trained in skill X, get trained in skill X. Let players choose what skills their characters have on basis of their background - class does not come into it. Let characters learn new skills during downtime.<br/><b>*</b> Make sure that your game doesn't get "unbalanced" by any particular skills that characters might have. This is easy as long as you don't insist skills to be the be-all, end-all of character building. You want to achieve a place where it's cool for your character to have some skill, but not so cool that players will be big babies about playing characters who don't have those skills.<br/><b>*</b> For extra flair, give character classes some cool ways to be mythic about specific skills. As a traditional example, let the Thief add their level (or whatever the appropriate scaling bonus is for you) to their skill checks when doing thief-stuff; they start out almost as mediocre as a non-Thief trained in those skills, but at higher levels they'll have an insurmountable, mythic advantage.<br/><br/>The specific way I accomplish these bullet points myself is by making skill checks on the formula <b>[Ability score]*[Skill %]+d20 vs DC</b> - in other words, a "fully trained" character uses their full Ability score in skill checks, while less skilled characters have a bonus ranging from zero to their full Ability score, depending on their skill level. Getting and raising skills is relatively casual; because skill "mastery" as a concept is cleanly capped by the character's Ability score, there's limited room for min-maxing on skills.<br/><br/>A mathematically more conventional approach would be to e.g. say that characters get an Ability modifier between -3 and +3 from their Ability to appropriate skill checks, and on top of that they can get a skill proficiency modifier of +4 if they're journeyman level, or +6 if they're master level in that skill. Then you just add and roll <b>[Ability bonus]+[skill bonus]+d20 vs. DC</b> (or roll under [Ability bonus]+[skill bonus]+10 if that's more your style), no different from how 3rd ed. or such do it. The only important difference is that the skills are not connected to the class/level paradigm by default; it's all about natural inclinations (Ability scores) and actual background-based skill proficiency. Also, there's a distinct cap to how high skills can go ("master" is as high as you go without extraordinary means), rather than it being an arbitrary numbers-game based on ever-inflating character levels.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464574/#Comment_464574" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-03T14:49:38+00:00" title="July  3, 2017  2:49PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2017 2:58PM by ValyrianSteelKatana.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/shimrod" rel="nofollow">shimrod</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Why do you want the 1st-level PC to be able to compete evenly with a 10th-level PC in a craftsmanship contest, or a court of law?

A consistent world in which the rules as the laws of nature for the D&amp;D universe. This is personal preference.<br/><br/>2. Player empowerment. In a game in which death is a single saving throw, critical hit, or unlucky surprise round away, combat is not the first resort for PCs. Or NPCs, for that matter. PCs should thus be capable of affecting the game without resorting to combat.\n<blockquote><br/>What does level mean then? As a default, I take it to be a measure of overall awesomeness. If you want a normal guy to be able to compete with an utterly awesome guy, it seems to me you're saying the other guy really isn't that awesome, and shouldn't be 10th level.</blockquote>\nA "level" is a unit that roughly measures a character's ability to endure hardship. A higher level increases his capacity for punishment in the form of increased hit points and better saving throw values. Both are measures of "protagonist power," in the form of resistance to death. Those who accumulate a high level are more likely to survive danger, allowing them to be bolder in their deeds.<br/><br/>What <a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> has suggested is essentially what I'm considering doing once I drag my players away from 5e and that blasted, awful, terrible no-good very bad skill system ingrained into it. (Not the exact percentage based system, mind you, as that would cause grave consternation among the mathematically-challenged.) My ideal form of roleplaying is the players engaging with the fictional universe and building from there. PCs should desire to learn and grow in ways that are not defined by leveling up, and the system should support that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464602/#Comment_464602" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-04T20:56:31+00:00" title="July  4, 2017  8:56PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 4, 2017 9:17PM by 2097.">edited July 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Just as a contrary example, and to document:</p>\n<p>In CC, levels are a measure of both practical power but also political power. If you want to be grand caliph you better be level 20. So you\u2019re torn between getting drama tokens (which expire at the end of the session) vs getting xp (which is a longer-term investment b/c levels). CC has some roots in ACKS where leveling is also tied to money and wealth. This bizarro Galt\u2019s Gulch world I\u2019m interested in exploring and deconstructing since it\u2019s so contrary to my own view of what I value in life.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve stripped the skill list down from eighteen skills, to twelve (by removing the four cha skills, + insight, + investigation).</p>\n<p>But, profiency with tools and weapons are still all in the game (such as proficiency with with thieves\u2019 tools or with playing cards).</p>\n<p>And your chance of success with these things are a factor of your ability mod and your proficiency bonus. And these increase very slowly. This is great.</p>\n<p>A level 1 character has +5 in their best proficiency and a level 20 character has +11 in their best one. This is great.</p>\n<p>In a contest, the level 1 character still has a 22.75% chance of winning over the level 20 character, and there\u2019s a 3.5% chance of a tie. This is great.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also the case that you only need to write down twelve bonuses on your sheet \u2014 S/D/C/I/W/C, plus the same with proficiency added in. These are your numbers for spell attacks, for weapon attacks, for saving throws, for profiency checks, for everything. This is great. <small>(I know, I know, expertise, remarkable athlete, jack of all trades, etc etc. But, <em>typically</em> only these six.)</small></p>\n<p>CC uses a lot of rules from ACKS but the long and boring proficiency list in ACKS turned me off. When 5e came out and I saw that the skill system that I so dread in even relatively simple affairs like Lamentations of the Flame Princess, not to speak of more detailed games like ACKS or GURPS, was replaced with a ridiculously simple binary checklist of \u201ctrained\u201d vs \u201cnot trained\u201d, where the former sloooowly increased by 5 percentage points every four levels\u2026 I was in love! This is great.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t even have to write the trained numbers down, I can just do [(level + 7) / 4]. This is great.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve made hay talking to GURPS fans about \u201cWhat skill number should a random orcish baker have, <em>just in case</em> the players go deep undercover in an orc village and happen to instigate a bake-off?\u201d <a href="http://forums.sjgames.com/showthread.php?p=2096694#post2096694" rel="nofollow">GURPS Ultra-Lite solved it for GURPS</a>, and 5e:s binary \u201cproficient or not proficient?\u201d solved it for D&amp;D.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>The local sage who possess a vast knowledge of the planar cosmology?

In vanilla 5e, the traits, ideals, bonds and flaws are a huge part of the character.

If using <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20658/the-searcher-very-simple-5e-class/p1" rel="nofollow">the Searcher</a>, it\u2019s quite literally one number; everything is deterministically derived from how much xp you have.

Other classes add some krims-krams to it with different \u201cabilities\u201d and \u201cproficiency\u201d but it\u2019s usually no more than than 15 percentage units here or there. Not much difference in the cosmic scale of things.</p>\n<p>I know that there are some awesome stories about detailed skill systems, like that Luke Crane AP where he was training some skill (swordfighting\u2026?) in Burning Wheel. But if you make your game about skills, well, you make your game about skills. In 5e, that \u201ccomplexity budget\u201d has instead been spent on spells. Instead of endless skill lists, we have endless spell lists. And that appeals to me more.</p>\n<p>VSK, this isn\u2019t meant to dissuade you from your hacks or from your quest for a system that either</p>\n<ul>\n<li>has a fully detailed skill system but disassociated from level (like BW or whatever), or</li>\n<li>has <em>no</em> skill system (like Cthulhu Dark or whatever).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To me, OA/2e/3e was too detailed and 5e brings it more as close to having <em>no</em> skill system as I believe WotC was comfortable with at the time. In a way, 5e\u2019s system is very similar to the General Skills system in the Rules Cyclopedia p81-85, except you roll high instead of low, and, it improves by level, which I think is good.</p>\n<p>So far, my post has only been <small>and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve hesitated a couple of days before answering</small> \u201cHey, tangentially, and for the record, here\u2019s how things work in CC\u201d (just in case people go back to S-G in ten years just like I often go back to read RGFA and The Forge now). But now, to you:</p>\n<p>Why do you even want to <em>have</em> levels or anything like that? In 5e, unlike RC, your abilities go up as you go up in level. That makes you better at avoiding ambushes, making your saving throws, hiding, everything practical and dice-roll-ish. If you remove that, what\u2019s left?

I appreciate all contrary opinions as food for thought, and I was itching for your commentary on this thread. Clarification, however: from my understanding "CC" is your homebrew of 5e/Dramasystem/misc., correct? What does that stand for? Also:\n<blockquote>So far, my post has only been and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve hesitated a couple of days before answering \u201cHey, tangentially, and for the record, here\u2019s how things work in CC\u201d<br/></blockquote>\nEvery homebrew is yeast for the bread.\n<blockquote>Why do you even want to have levels or anything like that?

Characters do not automatically improve at "adventure-y" things that they do without special training, meaning they do fall behind (albeit gradually). I am totally content with hit points and saving throws being the primary means of level advancement (along with magical items and spells), allowing skills to increase with downtime training and experience.<br/><br/>The purpose of leveling in my mind is twofold: to grant the players more resources when delving into the dungeon (making returns trips less frequent) and allowing them to withstand greater adversity. This secondary reasoning--measured by increasing hit points and better saving throws--changes the dynamics between character and world: they can afford to be bolder and more decisive in their actions. They can impact the setting. It alters player psychology. By the end of Curse of Strahd, my players no longer feared the titular villain.<br/><br/>While 5e is miles better than 3e or 4e, I have a few complaints about it. I understand the design intent you outline here:\n<blockquote>It\u2019s not bad. Rather, it\u2019s a wonderful, simple, elegant solution that minimally solves its design constraints:<br/><br/>    be able to adjudicate as many situations as possible<br/>    be able to differentiate between characters<br/>    be able to improve over time<br/>    work the same way as the rest of the system (i.e. attack bonuses, spell attacks, saving throws)<br/>    be easy to learn, every skill works the same, no need to look at a skill list<br/>    be minimal and not take focus away from class abilities, feats, and above all: spells<br/></blockquote>\nBut rather, I find a set skill system in the manner of 5e encourages players to resort to their character sheets for problem solving. I likewise dislike the "middle way" of skills in 5e: I either want a finely-grained and expansive skill list that allows individual customization, or I want extremely broad categories of skills. 5e does neither for me, at least not without tinkering. (Ability score training is closer to what I desire and may be using in the future.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464626/#Comment_464626" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-05T21:35:59+00:00" title="July  5, 2017  9:35PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, CC stands for "Corsair Council", an NPC group in Nicky Rea's 1994 al-Qadim TSR box "Corsairs of the Great Sea" \u2014 in my campaign, some PCs are also council members while others work against the council while others strive to join the council.<br/>So I call the ruleset CC too.

Everything else was just "yeah, you can do it, let's say it takes\u2026 20 minutes?" or "Who here has high Nature? You two? You both know that this is a [\u2026]". We played finchian style.
