We played DW for the first time last night.  Granted, we suspect we had a few too many monsters in the groups we fought (six in each), and perhaps they ought not to have been armored, but Hack'n'Slash seemed amazingly ineffective.<br/><br/>Defy Danger emerged later in the evening as a more general purpose move than we originally took it for. It makes me think of World of Dungeons having one move.  It seems the de facto way of changing the tactical situation in some meaningful way (e.g. our bard throwing a tapestry over top of some pesky gargoyles, which allowed us to stomp them with relative impunity).<br/><br/>It was strange watching the bard save the day after the fighter has spent so many rounds knocking tiny stone chips off the gargoyles.  Going toe-to-toe with someone seems like the peak escalation of a conflict, so it was strange to have it feel grindy.<br/><br/>What's the secret?  Do you do damage plus a whole bunch of knock-on narrative effects?  (Like, 3 hit points' damage scares off most small monsters, or has them crashing into one another, taking additional, arbitrary damage?)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396938/#Comment_396938" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-09T14:30:52+00:00" title="November  9, 2012  2:30PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Grindy is not what we're aiming for or expecting! Which isn't to say it didn't happen, just that that's certainly not what we'd expect based on our play.<br/><br/>You mention gargoyles which are, yeah, pretty resilient things. That two armor is tough, but they're made of stone! Even then, I wouldn't expect it to take <i>too long</i> to deal with them. At only 3 HP under that 2 armor they're still definitely within one-hit range of everybody except the wizard (but the wizard can magic missile). Two attacks by even the cleric is likely to kill a gargoyle.<br/><br/>I'm interested in what the monsters were doing if the fight was getting grindy. Gargoyles are d6 damage I think? Even though that's on the low end they're nothing to scoff at. On top of that their moves give them quite a few ways to just deal damage to the players. They can blend into stone and then take them by surprise, maybe, or take to the air and knock down stalagmites.<br/><br/>Not every monster will go down easily, but in that case the monster is usually dangerous enough that it's the players who have to break off the fight (or try to).<br/><br/>Also, re: defy danger\u2014it is a catch-all, but that doesn't mean that it always has to be rolled. Your example with the tapestry, for example, might or might not be. If the bard is, say, on the balcony above and is dropping it down on the gargoyle it's probably not defying danger. On the other hand, if the gargoyle is bearing down on them and the bard is trying to get the timing just right, yeah, danger is being defied, roll!<br/><br/>In general, that kind of creative thinking\u2014using the environment to avoid making rolls, or deal damage directly, or whatever\u2014is exactly what should happen. Throwing a tapestry over someone so they can't defend themselves and the fighter gets to just deal damage is an excellent tactic!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_396939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396939/#Comment_396939" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-09T14:34:36+00:00" title="November  9, 2012  2:34PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>(Like, 3 hit points' damage scares off most small monsters, or has them crashing into one another, taking additional, arbitrary damage?)</blockquote>\nUmm . . . 3 hit points outright KILLS most small monsters. Generic Orc warriors are 3hp with no armour. Kobolds are 3hp with 1 armour and so are Goblins and Wargs. Elvish warriors are 3hp with two armour, so are Gargoyles.<br/><br/>Dealing 3hp to a small monster is pretty brutal and can be significant even before armour is subtracted.<br/><br/>If the fighter is knocking small stone chips off the Gargoyles, they're rolling crap for damage.

But I think that may be story games in general.  In the ideal world, the game supports it.  Hopefully it at least gets out of the way.

In my defence, I was running it on literally one hour of sleep, and I haven't run anything but the very occasional one-on-one BW game in a decade.  But yes, I think I maybe wasn't saying yes enough, and I certainly wasn't doing enough to keep the encounters interesting, and the two encounters the PCs had were with larger groups of enemies.  More variety would have helped, as would have making the battlespace more interesting.  I also should have been soliciting information about the environment more from the players rather than trying to generate as much of it as I was, especially since I didn't have it terribly well fleshed out.<br/><br/>Fuseboy actually came up with a really good list of factors that can be introduced to any battlespace to make it more textured.

Some GMs might use Hack &amp; Slash as a last resort in battle, others make it the go-to move. Depending on how you place and use your monsters within the game fiction, a battles can be impossibly easy or just impossible. It allows a lot of flexibility and control. Here's an example I've used previously (in <a href="http://www.dungeon-world.com/dungeon-world-guide/" rel="nofollow">my beginner's guide to DW</a>):\n<blockquote>Check this out:<br/>GM:"The kobold tumbles toward you, swinging a chain over his head."<br/>PC:"I'm gonna lunge at him with my sword."<br/>GM:"Sounds like a Hack &amp; Slash, go ahead and roll for it."<br/><br/>as opposed to this:<br/>GM:"The kobold tumbles toward you, swinging a chain over his head. He's like a whirling dervish, flitting around the battlefield with this rusty makeshift flail."<br/>PC:"I'm gonna lunge at him with my sword."<br/>GM:"He's leaping back and forth like crazy, and that chain is whizzing around like a blur, you're gonna have to Defy Danger to get close enough to even hit him. If you succeed, then you can roll for a Hack &amp; Slash."</blockquote>\nThat kinda stuff (usually called "fictional positioning") makes all the difference in how powerful the moves are individually. Does the GM ask for Defy Danger to run across the ledge? Or does she only ask when the player is <i>being attacked</i> on that ledge? Can you just use Hack &amp; Slash any time you attack, or does the GM prevent you with some other threat- an enemy's reach, ranged attacks, etc.<br/><br/>Basically, if it feels grindy then sort of evaluate <i>why</i> that is, and see if there are circumstances and details that you can bring out to change that. You've got a lot of control over how combat flows in your game; there are very few hard rules about what you're allowed to do and how exactly to establish the threat of your monsters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StuMc" title="StuMc"><img alt="StuMc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StuMc">StuMc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397148/#Comment_397148" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-11T19:46:30+00:00" title="November 11, 2012  7:46PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 11, 2012 7:49PM by StuMc.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>a lot of flexibility and control.</blockquote>\nThis. <br/><br/>What I love about the "world" games is that the DM has the power to mitigate circumstances that may otherwise kill players without fudging anything. <br/><br/>You can actually use something similar to both of Scrape's examples  above inside the one combat by changing the fiction. <br/><br/>In fact I did this just last night in "Musketworld" and it actually added an element of tactical realism. (Musketworld is a skeleton of a hack in progress). <br/><br/>When the players first encountered the revolutionary forces (ACW if you are curious, the players were loyalist militia), they had to deal with a bayonet formation before they could attack with their hangers/hawks/claymores. The players were not doing so well so I ruled after a hit or two that the enemy formation was now broken, the players were "inside the points",  which no longer needed to be negotiated every round. <br/><br/>Had the players been kicking butt, I would have had the enemy give ground in good order maintaining their formation and keeping their reach advantage.<br/><br/>btw, if you haven't read Scrape's beginners guide, I would.

Eon and I share that love of aggressive cinematic scene framing to our dungeon world, and it tends to mitigate any sense of grindyness. In my mind, this is all part of <b>being a fan of the characters</b> and <b>filling their lives full of adventure</b>.<br/><br/>I was just watching Snow White and the Huntsman again and that awesome fight with the Bridge Troll, and I couldn't help translating the scene in my head as I watched into the many permutations of the DW moves (other than just 'I hack and slash the troll'). Leading with the narrative and getting all cinematic. <br/><br/><br/><span class="VideoWrap"><span class="Video YouTube" data-youtube="youtube-e6uSLUnfna8?autoplay=1"><span class="VideoPreview"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6uSLUnfna8"><img border="0" height="385" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/e6uSLUnfna8/0.jpg" width="640"/></a></span><span class="VideoPlayer"></span></span></span><br/><br/><br/>Heres some of the interpretations I had, none of which seem grindy as a fiction - mechanical translation (albeit of a pre-determined outcome, but still)<br/><br/>When they arrive on the ancient stone bridge and see the carcasses strewn about, notice the unearthly silence and step cautiously onto the bridge, Snow White says she uses all her senses to <b>discern the reality of the situation</b> and scores a hit. She asks what she should be on the lookout for. The GM is winging it, has an idea, but offers it back to the Huntsman and asks him, 'so you've been through the dark woods before, what do you think?'<br/><br/>'Troll!!!!!' Is his answer and he draws his axe in peers through the gloom.<br/><br/>Or maybe the GM <b>shows signs of an approaching threat</b> and narrates the troll's eyes opening behind the characters. What do you do?<br/><br/>The GM narrates the troll waking up, detaching itself from the bridge and threatening the characters. The Huntsman authors that he leaps at the beastie hack and slashing with his axe. Unfortunately he misses and the GM makes a hard move against the characters, and <b>puts them in a spot</b>, taking a cue from the troll's moves. He bats them off the bridge into the muck below, <b>dealing damage</b> as warranted in the fiction, in this case a D8 of stun damage. He described the troll roaring at them as they stagger to their feet and bearing down on them, intent on grinding their bones. What do you do?<br/><br/>Snow White (knowing she is overpowered) says she runs away, looking for a place to take cover, maybe that rotten tree over there? Sure says the GM. This could easily snowball into being defying danger, but they turn to the Huntsman and ask what he's doing. He could be defying danger himself or hacking and slashing, but the players says he is running with the princess, guarding her rear as they flee toward the tree. Hmmm, the GM could go with the Huntsman drawing on their bond and <b>aiding</b> her <b>Defy Danger,</b> but instead goes with saying that it sounds like you are standing in defence of her then? Yup, says the Huntsman. I'm <b>defending</b> her! He rolls and scores some hold.<br/><br/>The GM describes the Troll smashing the tree to bits, following his <i>instinct</i> to <b>smash</b>! the Huntsman knows its hopeless, but he spends his hold to redirect the Trolls attention onto him, telling Snow White to Run! and leaps into the fray with the beast, narrating that he is ducking and weaving between the Beastie's legs as he <b>hacks</b> away. He scores a hit, but the GM makes an attack (monster move) in return, noting that the Troll takes the slashes from the axe, but his monster move <b>undoes the effects</b> of the Huntsman's attack. Flummoxed, the Huntsman runs away to try and get some distance <b>defying the danger</b> of the troll's smashing club like fists. He misses and the GM <b>hurls him away</b> <b>dealing 1d10+3 damage</b> in the process and giving the Huntsman the tag of <b><i>stunned</i></b>. The Huntsman spends another point of hold from his defend to halve the damage he suffers from the attack.<br/><br/>The GM <b>tells Snow white the consequences and asks</b>, as the Troll is looming over the Huntsman, fists raised to smash him to oblivion unless she interferes. What does she do? She describes running forward and screaming at the Troll to STOP!!!!! Is she <b>defying the danger</b> of the troll's instinct to smash with quick thinking? Is she <b>Defending</b> him?

(It certainly helps with making the players lives not boring)<br/><br/>If I can let characters live or speed things up or make things more interesting by making changes to the fictional/tactical situation that make fictional sense then I wouldn't give it a second thought. <br/><br/>Having said that, a failed roll is a failed roll and something bad is going to happen. I'd rather the character lose a thing/lose face/lose advantage than just always damage (and thereby possibly kill) people though as this makes for a better story and nobody at the table loses the time they have put into a character that is dead/out of action. I am the fist to admit though that this is my preference and that there is a certain "gamist purity" to letting people be done in statistically.  <br/><br/>And having said all *that* I definitely plan to have something different happen in musketworld to other hacks when the clock hits 12. I agree this is a good thing to change. <br/><br/>Noofy, Great post. <br/><br/>How you choose to approach a scene fictionally has a huge impact on the speed/narrative flow (grindiness?) and difficulty of resolution in a scene. <br/><br/>In your example you lay out the same scene resolved in different ways that give it a vastly different feel and probably a different mechanical result.<br/><br/>Sometimes making someone defend can be really tough whilst allowing them to aid instead might make things easy. The opposite may be true for certain characters in certain situations. I guess the follow on question here is: <br/><br/>"On what basis do you make the decision on how to resolve the scene?" Both of your examples follow the fiction so I'm not sure the answer lies there.  <br/><br/>There are a large number of factors that play into these decisions IMO. Things as boring as "we only have 10 minutes of the session to go so hurry the hell up" or as important as "Joe hasn't had much play tonight, I'll resolve this thing he isn't in quickly to give him some screen time" can mean that you go with the quick option. <br/><br/>Factors such as the genre itself, (say Cthulu vs Hornblower) would affect a decision both on speed of play and on deadliness. You may want a Cthulu game to be a slow build and super deadly where you may want a Hornblower game to be fast paced and full of people doing foolhardy things that don't get them killed. <br/><br/>In the AW book, Vincent talks about stretching and contracting the moves. A single roll might cover an entire scene or a single task. The former allows for quick resolution and high stakes (appropriate for a fictional "last throw of the dice") on perhaps a single die roll where the second allows for more chance of delicious 7-9 rolls, more snowballing moves more granular fictional problem solving, question asking, getting into trouble etc.<br/><br/>Whether you change the fiction by calling for different moves or no moves at all or do it by changing the actual happenings/situation, you are still changing the fiction. Aren't you? <br/><br/>Apologies for the quasi-hijack Fuseboy. Hope I kept it sufficiently relevant to pacing. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee" title="TildeSee"><img alt="TildeSee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TildeSee">TildeSee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397177/#Comment_397177" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-12T06:08:58+00:00" title="November 12, 2012  6:08AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What does she do?

You can see this in how the damage goes across between players and monsters\u2014the damage range exchanged between entities generally falls within the same range. d4 damage is <i>always</i> the bottom end, not-good-in-a-fight damage. d6 damage means the low-end of good\u2014like a goblin, or a thief who's not in their element. d8 is always a skilled combatant, like a ranger or a formian taskmaster. d10 is the high end of mortal, like a fighter or formian queen. d12, which comes up rarely, is pretty much superhuman.<br/><br/>So the damage going between things is pretty solidly in the same range. The idea is that an HP is an HP, more or less, everywhere.<br/><br/>That means that a fighter with high constitution really is one of the tougher mortal things to kill, and that goblins really do pretty much splatter. A wizard is actually tougher than many humans, on par with a bandit king.<br/><br/>For us, this is a sweet spot, especially since HP doesn't increase much. You play people who are at the high-end of human ability in a world where there are things much bigger and more dangerous than humans. Yes, the wizard has as much HP as 4 goblins, but those goblins have numbers. Yes, the fighter has as much HP as some mythical beasts, but that's because the fighter is strong enough to (maybe) face a mythical beast.<br/><br/>It comes down to how we look at monsters and PCs. Monsters are (as it says in the book) arrows fired and forgotten. They tend towards lower HP because they're numerous and, individually, unimportant (with a few exceptions). The PCs are important but not untouchable. They die, but not at the drop of a hat. They're not arrows, they're more like a good sword\u2014you use it and appreciate it, you even work to make sure you keep it, but when it shatters you just get a new one.<br/><br/>This is all a bit rambling. If thinking of player damage and monster damage as different things helps you, great. I just wanted to throw out that that may not be necessary. The fact that a goblin dies from a blow that would only badly wound a wizard is what we were aiming for, and it reflects the world we're trying to portray.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397202/#Comment_397202" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-12T10:08:07+00:00" title="November 12, 2012 10:08AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is helpful, actually.

It's just an example of how you might present an enemy, depending on whether you think of it as a skilled combatant or cannon fodder. If you find that easy enemies are too hard for your players, you might be <i>making</i> them too hard accidentally. Similarly, if your big bad dragon is just getting creamed, you probably aren't presenting the creature the way you're really imagining it, y'know?<br/><br/>So if you're picturing the upcoming fight and you're like, "there's all these kobolds that are just mooks, but there's totally this one badass kobold who really knows how to fight," my example is showing how you can showcase that, without ever having to change the kobold's numerical stats.<br/><br/>To bring it back to the original question: I don't think the <i>rules</i> are grindy. I think that if you're used to making to-hit rolls each round and you play that way, then you'll be Hack&amp;Slashing over and over and it will probably<i> feel</i> grindy. If you go in with a fiction-first mentality and describe all these crazy manuevers and stunts, you'll find the rules support that in a really elegant way. Battles become much more dynamic and fun.

It's odd.  I play in two groups - an indie group where we play-test Luke Crane games, and play BW, and another group more interested in Exalted and SW Saga.  I don't LIKE grindy roll conflicts.  But I seem to have defaulted to it.  It's a bit disturbing.<br/><br/>The first fight we had actually went reasonably well.  The players cut down the opposition fairly quickly, taking a few minor hits and consequences along the way.  It was the second one that went poorly... and I think it was partly because I was calling for rolls where rolls weren`t needed, partly because I wasn`t using fictional positioning agressively enough to make the players make serious choices, and partly that what with the players` abilities to avoid damage, and the Gargoyle armour, it just took a really long time.<br/><br/>Feeling a bit better about it.

I have my monsters do crazy stuff that makes the players react, instead of just being like "it swings at you." Also, I encourage my players to try weird stunts as well. Once they realized that they could do cinematic chandelier-swinging stuff as a matter of course, instead of consulting a list of abilities, they took to it quickly. Don't get me wrong, I use Hack&amp;Slash quite a bit. But often the stakes aren't just "you both take damage," instead I disarm, trip, or push them into a bad position. It makes every attack seem varied instead of just, you know, trading blows.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397347/#Comment_397347" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-13T10:56:55+00:00" title="November 13, 2012 10:56AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also remember that "Attack an enemy in melee" doesn't have to be one DnD-style attack roll.

Is that true?  We were bemoaning the lack of Gang rules.<br/><br/>And I was thinking that hack and slash could be described maybe as "When you exchange blows with the enemy."  Rolling the damage also seems quite restrictive - it means you only use Hack and Slash when you're doing damage.  Any narrative effect is additional.  So if you're in melee, trying to tangle someone in a net, but aren't doing damage, would Hack and Slash be appropriate?  For example, our Paladin was grappled by a bunch of tiny Gargoyles.  Narratively, he couldn't hit them with his weapons, so he chose to fall on them, crushing them with the weight of his armour.  I interpreted that as Hack and Slash...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397481/#Comment_397481" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T10:13:24+00:00" title="November 14, 2012 10:13AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the beauty of the rules is that the GM has some freedom when it comes to moves.

IMO that is a poor choice (contrast to AW). There is a certain amount of freedom in the game but too much reliance on this means a lack of procedural support that ensures the play experience is heavily dependent on the GM (or GM+players).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397539/#Comment_397539" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-14T18:03:38+00:00" title="November 14, 2012  6:03PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, in hindsight, the default (and only option) for a PC on a successful H&amp;S is to deal damage.

If you increase incoming damage JUST because they can take it, then there's nothing special about having the extra armor. But if it becomes an opportunity for a character to singlehandedly plug a dyke, then they get to be awesome.<br/><br/>Also, some attacks bypass armor. Once the characters level up a bit, it makes sense to break those out a little more often.<br/><br/>And, of course, there's tons of monsters that are not d6 damage.<br/><br/>Again, think of the high armor as an opportunity to demonstrate badassness. So it's cool if sometimes it is super effective and 1-2 or your players are near immune for a fight. What are the results of that - how are they then affected by the fact that half or more of their party are still plenty squishy and in peril?

However, I tend to try to avoid giving out too many +1s and -1s ad hoc, as it slows everything down. Instead I'd say it changes the fiction, therefore changing <i>when</i> you have to defy danger. For example: the lightly armored thief doesn't have to defy danger to fight in the shallows, but the fighter, weighed down by armor and shield, does. There's no particular danger for the thief to defy, but the fighter is seriously in danger because of the weight. Likely hard moves on a failure would be put them in a spot (half drowning and at the mercy of their combatant) maybe, or tell them the consequences and ask.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397825/#Comment_397825" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T08:39:34+00:00" title="November 17, 2012  8:39AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +100 to what Rob said about armor.

You know, whatever actually makes sense for the situation at hand. In games where armor is just a static +AC thing, it leads to a disconnect sometimes between what the rules require and what everyone says is going on. And in DW, you can straight ask the player "how in the world does your shield help here?" and the answer may make all the difference.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397840/#Comment_397840" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T12:31:06+00:00" title="November 17, 2012 12:31PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2012 12:31PM by Scrape.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I should disclaimer that by saying that of course you can't do that all the time and of course you don't wanna ignore or negate the player's armor decision, that sucks.

It can be like that: you can make ap damage something very rare and special in your dungeon fantasy world, but something which sometimes occurs nonetheless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397858/#Comment_397858" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T13:36:48+00:00" title="November 17, 2012  1:36PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, yeah\u2026 Also, what <a href="/forums/profile/Scrape">@Scrape</a> said, which used to be called "Activate the downsides of their stuff", a classic MC move.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397871">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397871/#Comment_397871" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-17T15:45:57+00:00" title="November 17, 2012  3:45PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 17, 2012 3:52PM by skinnyghost.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Oh, yeah\u2026 Also, what <a href="/forums/profile/Scrape">@Scrape</a> said, which used to be called "Activate the downsides of their stuff", a classic MC move.</blockquote>\nThat one is called "Show a downside to their class, race, or equipment" now.<br/><br/>My favourite trick for people encased in a tonne of plate armour is to have some goblin climb up and start cutting the straps.
