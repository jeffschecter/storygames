On a hit, good fortune comes your way and you can specify that the very thing you need appears or occurs just when you need it; on a 10+, choose one, on a 7-9, choose two:<br/>\u2022\tThis draws the attention of witnesses who weren\u2019t supposed to see this.<br/>\u2022\tThe power you were calling on is used up; neither you nor the other kids can do this again until that power is restored.<br/>\u2022\tThere\u2019s a price to be paid and you lose something unexpected.<br/>\u2022\tYou let something loose that is not supposed to be here.<br/>\u2022\tThis really takes it out of you: you pass out and can only be brought around by an adult.<br/><br/><i>Lizzie grips the lucky charm pendant around her neck and wishes the shadow creatures to go away; on a hit, the charm shines with brilliant white light and the shadows melt away, but on a 10+, Lizzie\u2019s own shadow also fades out; how will she explain that to her family and can she get it back? On a 7-9, as well as losing her shadow, the pendant itself breaks and must be repaired before it can be used to drive back the shadow creatures again.</i><br/><br/>Whenever you get a hit on this move and were focusing your wish on or through a specific object, you can make a charm if you spend 1 more will: that object now becomes a charm that has that specific power and can be used to have this same effect again, indefinitely, without spending will.<br/><br/>You can spend 1 will after rolling to make a wish, in order to add +1 to your total, just as with any other move that requires a roll.<br/><br/><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And here's some explanatory text from the MC's chapter:</span><br/><br/>When a kid makes a wish, they are acknowledging their own desperation and faith: they are giving up on solving their own problems, instead relying on something invisible &amp; intangible to save the day for them. Making a wish is something that should never be done lightly:<br/>\u2022\tMost kids have dreams as one of their lowest stats, so if their problem can be solved by pulling a stunt, getting a clue, telling a lie, etc, then they have more chance of succeeding that way.<br/>\u2022\tYou have to pay the fee of 1 will: if you have no will, then you can\u2019t make a wish.<br/>\u2022\tThere are always consequences when you make a wish and they are often very serious: it might sometimes be better to miss on any other move than to get a 7-9 result on making a wish.<br/>If, even after taking all this into consideration, you still want to make a wish, roll+dreams but be clear on what you\u2019re getting: a wish doesn\u2019t change reality, it just makes things happen in the here and now, often in a way that seems almost plausible in hindsight.<br/><br/><i>Nicky is cornered by the escaped prisoners in a dead-end shaft, deep in the old abandoned mine where they stashed their loot before they were caught: there\u2019s a rock wall behind her and three tough, desperate thugs in front of her. Nicky is good in a scuffle, but three-against-one isn\u2019t good odds; as they close in on her, she crouches down into a ball, whispering an old, half-remembered nursery rhyme in the dark, a memory of her grandmother...<br/><br/>Nicky\u2019s player spends 1 will, announcing her intent to make a wish and rolls+dreams, getting a final total of 8: it\u2019s a hit, but there will be two consequences. The MC narrates how the crumbling rock of the shaft suddenly collapses, dropping a pile of rubble between Nicky and the convicts, while simultaneously the floor opens up underneath her and she lands in an underground stream with a huge splash. Nicky says that she passes out as the currents sweep her away, so it will need an adult to rescue her and bring her back to consciousness; also, she loses her grip on her precious flick knife, which sinks like a stone, so she will be without it for the rest of this session.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_449676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/449676/#Comment_449676" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-11-21T19:12:27+00:00" title="November 21, 2015  7:12PM">November 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a special move from the Gadgeteer origin from <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B1iTjRUomaBXQ1htN1NSREFVaVE&amp;usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Just Heroes</a>:<br/><br/>You are always ready to try out some new Experiment which will push back the boundaries of knowledge: when you build a large apparatus to produce any effect you can imagine (including giving a subject the equivalent of any style move, permanently), roll+genius.

That's why it has other nonsense like 3-18 ability scores too.  D&amp;D has spell lists, therefore, Dungeon World has spell lists.<br/><br/>For a game that doesn't, Monster of the Week uses a semi-freeform magic system, with a completely freeform "Big Magic" system stacked on top of it.  Here's the whole thing (I assume that since this is in a publicly available PDF, I'm not breaking any rules by posting it here):<br/><br/>Use Magic<br/>When you use magic, say what you\u2019re trying to achieve and how you do the spell, then roll +Weird. On a 10+, the magic works without issues: choose your effect. On a 7-9, it works imperfectly: choose your effect and a glitch. The Keeper will decide what effect the glitch has. advanced: On a 12+ the Keeper will offer you some added benefit.<br/><br/>Effects<br/>\u2022 Inflict harm (1-harm ignore-armour magic obvious).<br/>\u2022 Enchant a weapon. It gets +1 harm and +magic.<br/>\u2022 Do one thing that is beyond human limitations.<br/>\u2022 Bar a place or portal to a specific person or a type of creature.<br/>\u2022 Trap a specific person, minion, or monster.<br/>\u2022 Banish a spirit or curse from the person, object, or place it inhabits.<br/>\u2022 Summon a monster into the world.<br/>\u2022 Communicate with something that you do not share a language with.<br/>\u2022 Observe another place or time.<br/>\u2022 Heal 1-harm from an injury, or cure a disease, or neutralize a poison.<br/><br/>Glitches<br/>\u2022 The effect is weakened.<br/>\u2022 The effect is of short duration.<br/>\u2022 You take 1-harm ignore-armour.<br/>\u2022 The magic draws immediate, unwelcome attention.<br/><br/>The Keeper may say that...<br/>\u2022 The spell requires weird materials.<br/>\u2022 The spell will take 10 seconds, 30 seconds, or 1 minute to cast.<br/>\u2022 The spell requires ritual chanting and gestures.<br/>\u2022 The spell requires you to draw arcane symbols.<br/>\u2022 You need one or two people to help cast the spell.<br/>\u2022 You need to refer to a tome of magic for the details.<br/><br/>Big Magic<br/>Use this when you want more than the Use Magic effects. Tell the Keeper what you want to do.<br/><br/>The Keeper may require:<br/>\u2022 You need to spend a lot of time (days or weeks) researching the magic ritual.<br/>\u2022 You need to experiment with the spell \u2013 there will be lots of failures before you get it right.<br/>\u2022 You need some rare and weird ingredients and supplies.<br/>\u2022 The spell will take a long time (hours or days) to cast.<br/>\u2022 You need a lot of people (2, 3, 7, 13, or more) to help.<br/>\u2022 The spell needs to be cast at a particular place and/or time.<br/>\u2022 You need to use magic as part of the ritual, perhaps to summon a monster, communicate with something, or bar the portal you opened.<br/>\u2022 It will have a specific side-effect or danger.<br/>If you meet the requirements, then the magic takes effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
