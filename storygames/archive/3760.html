All it is is a consistent way for folks on Story Games and related sites to, if they want to, meet up and play games. Some groups (like RPGNet) are organizing a meetup (RPGNet = Sat night for 4 hours for chat and games, I'm going!).<br/><br/>Simply put, Shadow Gencon is going to be a non-organized meetup thing. People can show up, find out who all else is around, and group off to play games in common and open areas (or heck, just chill out over a soda or beer and chat) if they don't have other stuff scheduled. You don't have to be a "Story Games member" or anything like that. Lurkers welcome, complete strangers welcome, etc.<br/><br/>Here's what it looks like so far:<br/>DAY: Come to the Games on Demand area and say "hi". If you want to play there, bring Generic Tickets. If you want to play somewhere else, meet there, join up and go elsewhere.<br/>NIGHT: Come to the open gaming area ("cafeteria", unless they close it this year or something) at the Embassy Suites and say "hi".<br/><br/>That's it.<br/><br/>I'm looking to put more "oomph" into it, to increase the likelihood of meeting up with folks who want to do the same thing. So here's what I was thinking:<br/><br/>1) Do not put too much Hope into the system. This thing is really casual, relaxed and unorganized, so if you stake your hopes on doing all your gaming through this Shadow GenCon, that's gonna be pretty foolish.<br/>2) There's gonna be a "message board" of sorts at the Games on Demand area. I'll have some paper so that folks can leave notes bulleting-board style. Stuff like: <br/>"I'm running The Shadow of Yesterday at the X Microbrewery in town on Friday at 6:00! Write your name here if you will attend. If there are less than 3 names by 2:00PM on Friday, this will be cancelled!"<br/>"Looking for folks interested in trying my game. Will meet up in the Games on Demand area on Saturday at 2:00PM, then go elsewhere to play it. Write your name if you are interested."<br/>"Tonight at 10:00PM at the Embassy Suites cafeteria: Awesomequest!  Looking for players. 2 hours. Look for the guy in the fez."<br/>"I'll be in the bar tonight. Every night. -Keith"<br/><br/>It's not a huge thing. But it's a way to be sliiightly more organized then "meet up at GoD during the day, or at Embassy Suites at night". Which, honestly? That's what it's mostly going to be.<br/><br/>3) ***and this is the thing I would like help on*** I was thinking of a "contact list". Like, the folks who feel like they want to participate, they can provide the following:<br/>* Name<br/>* Cell Phone (if they have one, and if they want to be contacted) or text messaging contact info<br/>* Likely times they will be free ("Every night after 7:00!" "ALL THE TIME" "Before 12:00, after 5:00, but busy all day Sat" etc)<br/>* Games they will be ready to run (frex ME: Beast Hunters, Legends of Alyria, The Shadow of Yesterday, Dread, Tenra Bansho Zero)<br/>* Games they are particularly interested in playing or trying out (frex ME: Reign, Bliss Stage, Your Game for 2 Hours)<br/><br/>What I'd do then is compile the above onto one sheet of paper, and basically hand them out to anyone who comes to GoD saying "I'm interested in this Shadow GenCon thing". Then they'll have an idea of the folks who are certified interested in running or playing something, and an idea of where they are. They might then use the Message Board to contact those people to try to meet up and play something.<br/><br/>So, with that contact list, is that good enough? Should I be collecting more info? Less? Am I getting too hung up on organization here and just need to tell people "GoD at Day, Embassy at Night?" Other thoughts?<br/><br/>Not collecting info now, BTW, that will come later.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84286/#Comment_84286" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T11:11:58+00:00" title="July 31, 2007 11:11AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do I actually have to post that I am going to be at the bar every night or is it just implied?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84288/#Comment_84288" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T11:21:27+00:00" title="July 31, 2007 11:21AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Keith Senkowski</cite>Do I actually have to post that I am going to be at the bar every night or is it just implied?</blockquote>\nThat's just if you were planning on meeting up with someone in particular that didn't know you for more than 20 minutes.

I'm sure Kat will slap me if I'm wrong, but I see no reason why GoD games need to limit themselves to the GoD room (though we should try to keep that room hopping) or to games organized by the GoD volunteers.

Though he should, because he's great at running SotC, and has his own In the Works game.<br/><br/>So cool, we'll coordinate some of this at the con. <br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
