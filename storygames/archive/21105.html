It actually looked pretty similar to the "no myth" game described on Forge. I was reading Everway and Steffan O'Sullivan but then pushed it further and even more lower-case-i improvised.<br/><br/>In parallell to my "No Myth" games, I was also looking for... "How is it <em>really</em> supposed to be done, what are all of these pages and pages of rules and setting-books for?"<br/><br/>I read <a href="http://open.crngames.com/src/donjon.html" rel="nofollow">Donjon</a> before I had any experience with regular D&amp;D. So I didn't really get it. I mean, at that point, every game I'm reading I'm like "<em>Please</em> be the one book that tells me how to play roleplaying games?" all the while I'm doing my No Myth, no-fortune, no-stats, just DM-fiat improvised style wainscot horror campaign (I had four names of, hmm, deities, that were recurring and their personalities were pretty well defined, but the rest was made up on the spot).<br/><br/>I had read the Threefold and a lot of rgfa stuff but I thought "simulationism" (not talking about GNS sim here) required super calculators and patience. "Oh, you're going to take one step? Let's see here\u2026 if G is 9.80665 m/s\xb2, and your characters shoesize is 9W, with 2d6 months of usage\u2026" (That example is hyperbolic; the digging example and the jumping example that follows are real.)<br/><br/>And prep? I hadn't understood how prep could be "fractal", I thought you'd have to prep every grain of sand individually. "Well, GURPS page B350 says that hard clay needs to be broken up with a pick at \u2156\xd7(ST\xb2) cubic feet per hour and then shoveled away at 2\xd7ST\xd7ST/5) cubic feet per hour\u2026 so I need to define the soil types and depths everywhere on the planet that the adventure is taking place in."<br/><br/>There is a thread on TPB, I think this is from right before, or right after (but the pieces hadn't fallen into place yet), I had the mirror experience. And I'm asking and asking and asking one of the biggest GURPS fans on there:<br/><br/>"But the PCs have to pay 20 character points per HT and 20 character points per DX and 20 character points per level Extra Basic Speed (which you normally buy in fourths, at 5 per) and 5 character points yard of per Extra Basic Move to then be able to jump min(((2\xd7([yards ran before the jump]+(HT+DX)/4+[Extra Basic Speed]+[Extra Basic Move]))-3), (2\xd7(2\xd7((HT+DX)/4+[Extra Basic Speed]+[Extra Basic Move])-3))) feet over a chasm" (BTW, that [i]is[/i] the actual rule in GURPS 4, page B352, if you fold in all the references to page B15 and B17. And yes, I know that (2\xd7((2\xd7X)-3)) doesn't need those parentheses and that it can be simplified to 4\xd7X-6.)<br/><br/>"They have to do so much work in order to get over the chasm, and they have to make those investments already at build time. But where does the chasm come from? And how is its width determined?"<br/><br/>And he's like: "What do you mean? The GM just put in whatever chasms they like."<br/><br/>And I'm thinking... "this can't be how it works, this is bullshit".<br/><br/><br/>So when I had the mirror experience my brain was on the floor from how real and solid it had felt. Even though it's a completely unrealistic magical mirror. And it's just a couple of lines in the module.<br/><br/>All those who are maybe ten, twenty years older than me and started with Moldvay or Mentzer, they had that solid experience for free and could discard it as they wished to craft stories with illusionism and pacing. Same for those who are a little bit younger than me and started with d20.<br/><br/>But when I grew up, I had none of that. It took me 15 years to find it, and I've had it for about 5 years I'd say.<br/><br/><small>Ironically, GURPS could be the perfect sandbox toolkit once you have good prep techniques. Use GURPS Ultra Lite for all rando NPC:s like the hot dog salesman on the street etc is "Hot Dog Salesman 2", just in case you need <em>some</em> stats if something happens (everything else is derivable from that, for example if for some completely unforseen reason you need to know how fast he can help dig something, he'd break up clay at a rate 40 cubic feet per hour (using the aforementioned formula), and if he gets zapped by aliens who suddenly invade Mainstreet, he has 10 hit points). (GURPS Ultra Lite's combat system is broken but for a "just in case we need stats" NPC it's golden. Put in 1-7 levels anyway you'd like (on basic attributes, professions, and wealth, as per GUL) and you're set. You don't even need to know what he thinks of the PCs since there's a detailed reaction system [which most GURPS GMs never use...])<br/><br/>And in a game where digging for stuff is salient or has become salient, put in a "default" soil composition for when PC:s just go digging wherever, and develop a shorthand for specifying it when needed, for example "The treasure chest is buried six feet deep; two soft soil over four clay."<br/><br/>Ah, well, good prep techniques for GURPS, there's definitely a shortage of. I'm not sure I'd be able to pull it off. The "How to be a <em>GURPS</em> GM" book advocates illusionism and faking it. Which... feels like a bit of a mismatch to the games mechanics?</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_463049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463049/#Comment_463049" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-06T20:58:58+00:00" title="May  6, 2017  8:58PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good insights here, Sandra. You nailed the issues with this kind of design and play.<br/><br/>I remember going through a phase of really wanting to do "D&amp;D in GURPS", as a hard Simulationist fantasy adventure game, with rigorous prep and such. Use the rules as "the physics of the gameworld" and have them effectively output "what would really happen".(Do you remember GURPS Gulliver, by any chance? That was the labour of someone who was really invested in this kind of thing. May be worth looking up in case it's still online! It was a pretty amazing resource.)<br/><br/>But, as you point out, it all falls flat because you still need GMing principles and prep tools, not just to make it into a functional game, but also just to make it human-readable. The fantasy, nice as it is, is not realistically achievable (at least not for the average gamer).<br/><br/>I went the opposite way of you, in a sense:<br/><br/>I saw that player judgement and relatively freeform rules could create a more lifelike "simulation" than any mathematical system. Some of my best gaming was with Fudge, where the resolution mechanic was, roughly:<br/><br/>"Let us think about the current situation and imagine the best possible thing that could happen as an outcome. That's <i>Superb</i>. Now, what is the worst possible? That's <i>Terrible</i>. And now we roll!"<br/><br/>Assuming the group is good at getting on the same page, and/or trusts the GM implicitly, it works really well.<br/><br/>Of course, the danger is that, over time, the burden on the GM is heavy and there are few tools to help. The game is doing very little to help with what is essentially freeform roleplaying.<br/><br/>I'm glad I have games now that are more "self-aware" about what's happening between the actual players at the table and leverage that to create some awesome gaming. Sometimes the somewhat immature "virtual reality RPG" dreams feel like something that was discarded along the way, but I rarely miss them, when held up to the consistently fun gaming new understanding and better tools have given me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_463052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/463052/#Comment_463052" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-05-06T21:11:21+00:00" title="May  6, 2017  9:11PM">May 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2017 9:29PM by 2097.">edited May 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was exactly my reaction at the time \u2014 all this is meaningless but Fudge is at least <em>easy</em> and unintrusive.
