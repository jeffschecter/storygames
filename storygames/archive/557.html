<p>A "fatal goal," classically, is a goal that the character is pursuing, but which the author and audience don't want him to achieve (or don't want him to achieve at that stage in the story).</p>
<p><em>Buffy</em> would (I suspect) become a sad, pathetic little show if the Scooby Gang succeeded in closing the Hellmouth and driving all supernatural evil from Sunnydale.  That's a fatal goal.</p>
<p>That "I suspect" is important.  One of the great insights of Story Now gaming is that many apparently fatal goals <em>aren't</em>.  If your character's issue is being respected, and he pursues a goal of killing all his enemies and rising to the throne ... that is <em>not</em> a fatal goal.  He can do all of that, and still lack for respect.  And the things he'll do as a king in order to command respect are wonderful and horrifying.  Still makes for a good story.</p>
<p>But once you dig down inside the skin, fatal goals seem to fly fast and furious.  The classic:  "This character reaches a state of contentment, where they need no longer strive for anything."  That <strong>kills</strong> any story about that character.  It can only be their climax or their epilogue.  I, at least, can't tell an interesting story about a person who has nothing to strive for.</p>
<p>So in another thread, Graham looked at the question of "What do you do for a conflict of a young man trying to summon the nerve to confess his feelings to the girl he loves?" and he argued (reasonably enough) for closure:  either the girl accepts his affections or she smacks him down in what seemed (to me) a pretty permanent fashion.  The conflict is resolved and off the table.</p>
<p>But I have a strong suspicion that for some games (possibly for <em>all</em> games) closure on a PC-to-PC relationship is inherently a fatal goal:  it is saying "This relationship is not going to change any more," which says (again, to me) that there is no more story between those two characters.  You don't need to <em>ever</em> put them in the same scene again.</p>
<p>So are fatal goals and story-driving choices qualitatively different animals?  Two ends of a unified spectrum?  Two independent measures unrelated to each other?  Or something else entirely?</p>

                            I think I get what you're saying, Tony. Fatal goals are kind of weird, I guess, because it's tough to define them as a simple statement.<br/>
<br/>
Films like Jaws and Die Hard had fatal goals because once the shark/terrorists were all dead, the movie is over. Yet they still made sequels with more sharks/terrorists cause hoodoo.<br/>
<br/>
Alan Moore faced a similar deal in Swamp Thing because he realised that if Swamp Thing ever became human again, the series would be over. What moore figured is that readers didn't much care for that as they would know instinctively that if Swampy ever achieved his goal, the series would end, which basically means that they'd be jerked around on that point for decades (see the Fantastic Four and the Thing's quest to become human again. I have a handful of issues and in most of them Reed came up with something that would finally make Ben Grimm human again but they always failed) So, Moore changed the Swamp Thing so that he wasn't originally human after all but a plant monster that things it was, thus giving him a new goal in life.<br/>
<br/>
I get the feeling that all character goals are fatal in a way as they will end the story in question. But the difference is how easily a new goal can be generated. Mission: Impossible, for instance had a built-in goal generator as at the begining of every episode Peter Graves would get the tape recorder and a new mission "should you choose to accept it", which he always did or else there would be no story.                        </div>

<p>Jack?  Are you ... y'know ... actually arguing <strong>against</strong> anything anybody has said, or are you just making a personal statement that you don't think continuing stories are inherently advantaged over closed stories and daring anyone to oppose you?</p>
<p>'cuz if you're just taking this moment to make your personal stand for all that's right and decent, well carry on ... in yer own damn thread.  Fuck, man.  They're free.  Ain't no call to try to drag mine off into left field.</p>

                            Back into center field:<br/><br/>I would distinguish between <i>player</i> goals that bring closure, and character goals that do so.<br/><br/>When it comes to character goals, I think just about any goal can be warped to make it a goal that works in a serial story.  Every story ending can be the beginning of a new story, even if that story is in a very different genre or has a different tone.  For example, if Buffy had closed the Hellmouth, one could begin a new story where she has to deal with the demons that she's therefore sealed on this side, and who want to get home.  Not that that's necessarily the best story in the world, but it's an example of how taking the conclusion of the old story as the premise can suggest further problems.  It sounds like Vaxalon's example of a "complete" relationship as a story-driver is much the same thing.<br/><br/>When the <i>player</i> doesn't want to make stories with the character anymore, though, or isn't willing to follow through with any necessary changes in the nature or tone of the story that come out of the resolution of their goals - well, I'm not really sure that you can do much to keep the goals attractive.  I think the goal of "The character achieves a state of contentment" is a way for the player to say, "I'm done with this story," even though there are certain ways for other group members to continue to challenge the character.  The reason I think this is because this goal is not about something concrete (the character gets to date someone, or defeat their arch-rival, or whatever).  The very nature of the goal says, "Whatever the character wanted, they got exactly that."<br/><br/>Of course, if you're like me, you then proceed to show the character exactly why this is a monkey's paw situation.  But I happen to be really mean and evil.<br/><br/>On a slight tangent, I think this difference actually has something to do with the discussion in the thread about within-character conflicts and how those work.  When you are dealing with how the character is going to feel, you're defining the end state that you are trying to get to, as opposed to the things that happen to (maybe or maybe not) get you there.  I, at least, always have a much easier time dealing with the concrete than the abstractly emotional when it comes to making story, because people (both real people and the characters in the story) are much better at controlling actions than feelings.  Feelings always come from actions, in the way that I think about stories; everything is always anchored in the concrete.<br/><br/>For the record, I do plan open-ended games differently from the way I plan fixed-end (usually short-or-medium-term) ones.  But I think that's another thread.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            I don't buy it, Tony. Let's look at "This character reaches a state of contentment, where they need no longer strive for anything."<br/>
<br/>
Game:  Buddhas in the Vineyard, where we play ascended masters who have perceived ultimate truth, but who choose to remain in the world of illusions in order to liberate others. Pretty much by definition, you can't change a guy who knows ultimate truth, which means there's not going to be a dramatic arc to the personal evolution of the PCs. (This implies some changes in the mechanics, of course, but take them as made.)<br/>
<br/>
But hell if it isn't a compelling premise -- the point of play is for the players to work out what the right thing is to do, unhindered by anything, and that means it would force me to actually figure out what the genuinely no-fooling right thing is and persuade the other players of that. I don't know if I could play such a game....                        </div>

                            I agree with the idea of the existence of fatal goals - I also think that players may have game-fatal goals that their character doesn't necessarily share, even unstated. "I want my character to be so badass nothing can ever stop or even threaten them ever again." "I want the GM never to be able to seriously injure my character's capabilities."                        </div>

<em>So are fatal goals and story-driving choices qualitatively different animals? Two ends of a unified spectrum? Two independent measures unrelated to each other? Or something else entirely?</em><br/><br/>I'd say they're different uses of the same thing, conflict.  There are conflicts that, when resolved, lead to more conflicts or leave other conflicts open, and there are conflicts whose resolution clears the field of other conflicts.  A good story uses both -- the first throughout most of the story, and the last at the end.  I think there's a lot to be said for recognizing the difference and giving the players tools to keep their story going as long as they want it to, and then ending it when they want it to end.                        </div>

Huh?  What?<br/>
<br/>
Stories naturally conclude.  Thus, a game which does story well necessarily drives towards fatal goals.  This is a good thing, not a bad thing.<br/>

Closure is good when I'm looking to end a game, not so good at other times (though it can be really interesting even mid-stream).

Yes, of course you don't want every goal to be fatal.  But I totally disagree that all fatal goals are negative.<br/>
<br/>
What you need is to distinguish when is the right time for fatal goals.  That requires some manner of long-term pacing, mechanical or learned.<br/>

                            On the other hand, this changes game to game.  Sure, if I'm playing <em>Pride and Prejudice: the RPG</em> I'm going to want my character to get married and end the game eventually.<br/><br/>However, if I'm playing something with serial structure, I may not be interested in ending the game ever -- <em>Buffy</em> or <em>Star Trek</em> or <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> all come to mind.  I don't expect in my games of these stories I'd turn Sunnydale into a crater, kill the Federation, or defeat the Cylons.  Now, certainly each serial installment of such a game ends the immediate situation, but nothing ever resolves the premise of the game/show.                        </div>

                            What an interesting thread. I think this thread isn't so much about stories <i>ending</i> as about stories ending <i>prematurely</i>. <br/><br/>For example, imagine if we're playing a Lord of the Rings RPG, and the hobbits are hiding from the Nazgul, and suddenly we're faced with the dilemma: this conflict is about finding the ring, so <i>what happens if they actually get the ring?</i>. The story's over.<br/><br/>Sometimes resolving a fatal goal can kill the story. But it can also re-energise the story: perhaps the story then becomes about the Fellowship trying to recapture the ring or defending itself against an almost invincible Sauron.<br/><br/>Oh, and there's one point that I don't think has been made so far. In Tony's original post, he said:
<blockquote>But I have a strong suspicion that for some games (possibly for all games) closure on a PC-to-PC relationship is inherently a fatal goal: it is saying "This relationship is not going to change any more," which says (again, to me) that there is no more story between those two characters. You don't need to ever put them in the same scene again</blockquote>
I think it's important to notice that this is a <i>PC-to-PC</i> relationship.<br/><br/>Let's imagine my goal is "Get Sally to be my girlfriend" . And I ask her on a date and she laughs in my face.<br/><br/>If Sally is not a PC, this doesn't kill the story. Perhaps the experience makes me stronger and I forget about Sally and ask someone else on a date.<br/><br/>But if Sally is a PC, the story is in real trouble. We need to keep both me and Sally in the story, but where do we go after that rejection? There's not many options: perhaps me and Sally become friends, but it's unlikely. If PCs are involved, I think, fatal goals are much more likely to kill a story.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            In my mind the idea of "fatal goals" is fatally flawed.  I can't concieve of any plot resolution that doesn't leave room for further plot.  I supose I can allow for exception if the universe is destroyed or all characters in the story are dead.  <br/>
<br/>
But such extreme measures don't seem to be what we are talking about here.<br/>
<br/>
I'd prefer to talk about a "story pause".  This is a place where the story could stop if it wanted to.  Frodo gets to Rivendel.  Buffy dies at the end of season 5.  Joseph dies in Egypt.  Sabriel accepts her role as Abhorsen.  Mr. Collins accepts Elizabeth Bennet's rejection and marries Ms. Lucas.<br/>
<br/>
All of these would be dramatically different stories if they stopped early.  Its clear (to me at least) that all of them could have been continued past their written end (consider all the apendixes of Lord of the Rings).  A story pause is a place where the story could end with some degree of satisfaction.  It feels like a natural stopping place, even if we want to pick the story back up again.<br/>
<br/>
Now I belive that there are prefered stopping places to a story, even amoung the pauses.  Buffy might have been a better show had it ended in season 5 rather than season 7, for instance.  Pride and Prejudice ends just about perfectally, to my mind.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the prefered stopping place is what we are talking about when we talk about fatal goals?<br/>
<br/>
That is probably the case, but its also clear that there is no sharp division between a fatal goal and a non-fatal one, as the term seems to imply.<br/>
<br/>
One final thought before I go: The fatalness of a goal depends on the medium of the tale!<br/>
<br/>
Graham's example of a love story between two PCs features the fatal goal of rejection.  I submit that this is only fatal in a RPG where there are two PCs who must be in a "party" of some sort.  Its easy to think of a book or movie about the rejected high school romance that blosoms years later (though of course I can't).  <br/>
<br/>
This would work in a movie or a book, but not in a RPG (because several character must continuously interact at the forefront of the story) or a TV show (because of the jaring effects of large amounts of time passing on the audience and the makeup artists).<br/>

Also, I think it would be useful to distinguish between one continuous story and one story ending and another story beginning with the same setting and characters.  Cause "Buffy" is not a story.  Buffy is a series of many stories.                        </div>

<br/>
Grosse Point Blanker (if you will) could continue with Martin's unsuccessful attempts to get out of the assasination buisiness, Debi's desire for him to join with suburban life, and the like.  Debi and Martin pairing up seems like it opens up a whole new can of worms to me.  I'm *not* arguing that a sequel / continuation would improve the story, it most likely would not, but the pairing up of the characters suggests plot lines to me rather than closing them down.<br/>
<br/>
I think where we may disagree is in your definition of "story".  For me Buffy is a single work, divided into arcs that are part of the same story.  By your definition I can certainly see that any continuation of Martin Blank's life would be a new story.  But that's not my take on what a story is.<br/>

The "what is a story" question, seems to take this thread off into a different ballpark, let alone a different field, so I'll leave that be for now (though it would be an interesting discussion!)<br/>

                            Well, any continuing story is a series of many stories.<br/>
<br/>
Well, hold on, not exactly. Some stories have some kind of over-arching plot that continues from episode to episode, like in Lost, 24, or the Donkey Kong Jr cartoon show from the 80's. These shows have some kind of plot that drives the show and is part of the concept. Such as, Donkey Kong Jr was looking for his papa or the cast of Lost wants to get the heck off the island, or at least figure out what the hey is going on or whatever the hell 24 is about. I don't watch that one.<br/>
<br/>
However, in all of these shows, there is a plot for the individual episodes. These plots may or may not advance the main plot, but they are usually resolved in some way by the end of the show.<br/>
<br/>
In Donkey Kong Jr, the main plot was just a McGuffin to give him an excuse to travel around with his friend who was kind of like Fonzie and Jon Arbuckle from Garfield had a kid, meeting strange people who are in trouble and then helping them.<br/>
<br/>
In the other two shows, the show plot is usually a subset of the main plot in some way and at least marginally advances the main plot in some way.<br/>
<br/>
But it is a fatal goal because it effectively ends the show. If the cast of Lost is ever rescued, the show's over. Heck when the cast from M*A*S*H got to go home because the war ended, the show ended. It can be argued that the show could still continue, but After M*A*S*H didn't last very long, did it?<br/>
<br/>
So a fatal goal is some kind of goal that resolves the situation that put the character(s) in motion in the first place and once resolved, a situation needs to be cooked up to put the characters back in motion.                        </div>

                            Jack, not to burst your bubble, but getting off the island in Lost is just as much a McGuffin as Donkey King's dad.  That's not the plot, that's the premise.                        </div>

<p>I agree with JBR.</p>
<p>If the protagonists in <em>Lost</em> all came to know and trust each other, <strong>that</strong> would be a fatal goal.  Once that happens the situation is no longer conflicted.</p>
<p>It's not that you couldn't make a story that continues from there, but you have to <em>make it</em>.  It isn't provided for you.  If ... shit ... I only watch the DVDs so I'm a season behind, assume I'm thinking from the end of last season ... if Locke becomes undisputed high priest of the island and everyone (even Jack) agrees to follow his orders, that outcome already provides you with your next set of conflicts.  You don't have to make up anything new, that situation as it stands is already rife with conflict.</p>

                            Stakes should never be final and forever.  They should always be about the immediate situation.<br/><br/>To be honest, Tony, I'm actually quite surprised that you would suggest the stakes:<br/><br/><i>Think of it in terms of Stakes-setting: Xander and Cordelia never resolved a goal where the stakes were "If you win we go out on a date, and if you lose then we never, ever will." Agreed?</i><br/><br/>I agree that those would be horrible, terrible stakes.  Isn't that one of the lessons of Capes?  That nothing should be always and forever?<br/><br/>If I were running a game and those were the stakes, I'd suggest that there be a "key" that unlocks them.<br/><br/>"If you win, Xander and Cordelia will make out in the supply closet, if I win, they'll keep sniping at each other until Xander has had a date with someone else."                        </div>

<p>I like the "Key" idea.  I may well nick that in some sense or another.  You can also do much the same thing by saying "Okay, you needed to have a whole pile of resources to even attempt to address this conflict ... now that you've spent them and failed you don't get to try again until you've gathered those resources all over again."</p>

If you fail certain tasks, such as scribing a spell into a spellbook that's over what you can cast, you can't try again until you've gone up a level.                        </div>
