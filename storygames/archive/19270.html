Brother fights brother as Oliver Cromwell and his New Model Army clash with Royalist forces for control of the nation. These are the last years of the giants whose ancient presence in these isles will be extinguished by the first flourishes of modernity. Players take on the role of the giants, nomadic humanoids 25-50 feet tall who have lived alongside the Britons since the dawn of time, with their own culture being passed from giant to giant through the centuries - tales of great warriors and ancient grudges. Giants are fearsome in battle, ugly as hell and greedy opportunists on top of it all - often seeing themselves literally above the suffering of the little men. Conflict with "Christians" has been regular but it's mostly Giants coming down from the hills to extort small communities with threats of violence or "sell" their "services" for livestock and beer. <br/>  The ancient laws of England state that every parish must be responsible for the upkeep of longbowmen in their defence against roving giants. The killing of a giant in this way is rare, although the advent of cannon and musket has radically changed this tenuous balance. Giants, for all their lack of empathy with humans, are very interested in the bloodlines of the little men and will hold grudges against those who do them harm for generations to come. Giantslayers are folk heroes but the threat of retaliation is very real. Giants are territorial and the longest-lived are those who've made pacts of mutual interest with the humans living in their "thrall," though this can lead to destructive combat between Giants fighting for influence.  <br/>Giants are keen warriors, effective with tree-trucks and boulders as well as fists and feet. Blades of iron of any size are uncommon but are a sure signs of a Giant's prowess and successful extortion of human metallurgy on a vast scale for giants have no forges of their own. The Kings of the Little Men have sometimes called the Giants to a moot, as is their ancient right, and Giants have gone to fight in human wars for wine, horses, gold and amnesty for their crimes. Charles I fears the giants and Cromwell holds them in high contempt but both Royalists and Parliamentarians would rather buy off the local Big-Men than have them interfere in their battleplans.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Gameplay</b></span><br/>Players take on the role of a wandering Giants in 17th Century England. Giants are primarily motivated by hunger and rely greatly on human contact for sustenance, which brings them into a range of conflicts and relationships (hunting and foraging are less dangerous options but the pickings are slim when your stomach can house a large family with room to spare!). PCs will be able to move around a large map with an eye on campaign play and potentially PvP activity: making "Demands" of human villages and considering "offers" from the same, developing relationship with communities (both for good and bad) and with other giants (who are, after all, rivals for resources). Sandbox gameplay with good relationship/grudge maps motivating players to interfere with one another's activities and resource gathering. Giant-fights'll be the star of the show: I've written a nice little damage table that gives them the feel of Shoho moster-movies - lots of collateral damage and fall out for any humans caught in the vicinity. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> As campaign play wears on I'd hope players would call for one side or the other in the Civil War and in doing so seal the fate of the Big Men. <br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bonus Round</span></b><br/>In addition to writing this up into a little gamebook, I'd also like to write a section converting the Giants of England and Wales into D&amp;D-terms to help GMs include this content in pre-existing campaigns, so more focused on dealing with Giants as a race on the human scale. Really, this game's a dumb conceptual Joke anyway - you're playing the monster from the manual fighting against adventuring parties played by the GM. <br/><br/>Let me know if this pleases you or fires up your imagination. I'm interested in moving away from traditional party-play and into a more greyscale world of inhuman motivations and complex relationships. You know, playing the monster. <br/><br/><br/><br/><i>tl;dr - you are one of the most powerful land creatures to ever grace the earth but your numbers are fewer every year. Conflict, banditry and the brutal politics of Hunger are your Jam.

I'm interested in playing the monstrous character (<i>Masquerade</i> without the glam); I don't think relationships necessarily have to be positive to be interesting. <i>Fiasco</i> is a good example of this perhaps? <br/><br/>Here's some lines of thinking I find interesting:<br/>- Giant characters are dependent on the activity and reaction of human communities. <br/>- The PCs are related by default being the last of their kind. <br/>- The major source of both threat and assistance for the players are the other players, PC-relationships are ambivalent. <br/>- Thugs, outlaws, bullies and berserkers are great characters! Their motivations are clear and pro-active in play, which I imagine to be like a reverso-world <i>Mouseguard</i>: often solitary PCs causing problems for the communities they visit. <br/>- It's basically <i>D&amp;D</i> (challenge-to-profit adventuring) but keyed into nature - there's no interior a PC can explore, so it forces play back out into human communities, hopefully pulling the players between the desire to cooperate with their world and the desire to bend it to their will, which should ultimately spiral into their destruction. So not a particularly light game, but perhaps more dark in the way <i>WFRP</i> is dark - with a little humour to pierce the gloom. The PCs are oafish, squabbling giants after all. <br/>- Scene-based turn structure, GM-fullish.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429224/#Comment_429224" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-07T15:38:56+00:00" title="March  7, 2014  3:38PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it was this image that really got me thinking. <br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.dailyartfixx.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Giant-Keith-Thompson.jpg"/><br/>Credit Keith Thompson.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429235/#Comment_429235" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-07T21:53:40+00:00" title="March  7, 2014  9:53PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Attack on Titan in 17th century England?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429273/#Comment_429273" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-09T12:33:50+00:00" title="March  9, 2014 12:33PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's a solid topic, I would play a well-formed game built on this premise. Both giant PCs and the English Civil War are well worth examining as concepts for play.<br/><br/>I had the strong feeling that I'd seen this idea of playing giants as player characters somewhere before. The first thing that occurred was <a href="http://solarwiki.janus-design.it/en/book/4th-movement-species-near#giants-larger-than-life" rel="nofollow">TSoY giants</a>, which are sort of like this in theming, but then I remembered that there actually was an ashcan rpg a couple years back that was about giants and involved drawing a map while playing the game. I never saw the ashcan myself, and I'm not seeing the game in the Internet now, but I managed to figure out that its working title was <i>Giants</i> and it was created by "thelostgm" (real name unknown at this writing). As the Ashcan Front website is lost to superficial net-surfing I can't find anything solid on it right now, but I remember that it was a promising project before apparently being waylaid by the dread dooms that threaten all pretty little rpg projects.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429280/#Comment_429280" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-09T16:33:20+00:00" title="March  9, 2014  4:33PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great artwork!\n<blockquote>- Thugs, outlaws, bullies and berserkers are great characters!

The map-drawing was very much the highlight of play! I'm flipping through it real quick, and the core of the game revolves around:<br/><br/>- Giant's have Hunger, which are basically character goals. But the whole Hunger metaphor is extended through the system, so Giant's need to eat sometimes to satisfy their Hunger, which can have a pernicious effect on their communities; they can go into rages and hurt people accidentally, stuff like that.<br/>- your Giant's community really matters. Communities have stats, and can be the focus of struggles between Giants or the subject of Giant's attempts to satisfy their Hungers. Actually, Communities have more mechanics surrounding them than the Giants do, and you can kind of see how, over multiple sessions, the arc of the game becomes about the communities and how they deal with all these Giants running around and demanding things of them.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a neat bundle of ideas and the mapping part is really helpful to creating that sense of LARGE THINGS in a small world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429304/#Comment_429304" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-10T05:35:18+00:00" title="March 10, 2014  5:35AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's for the feedback, all! <br/><br/>Lower's <i>Giants </i> seems like a solid game; I've certainly had some of the exact same ideas. Hunger as a quantified motivator, for example - but I think Lower is more nuanced than the approach I was considering. Map-drawing on a Giant's scale was another part of play that I've been beaten to, I'm a huge fan of this kind of artefact-making in play. <br/><br/>I feel a little awkward about this project now: Do I push on as intended, ignoring similar material - or do I stand on the shoulders of giants (so to speak, ho ho) and embrace a giant-gaming-milieu as foundational to my design? <br/><br/>Let me just muse about Hunger mechanics for a second:<br/><br/>A giant's size is determined in character generation. The larger the giant the more "Food" it must consume per day or become Hungry (a larger giant gains bonuses to combat, intimidation etc. Hungry giants are forced to take immediate action to feed themselves). For example: A 50-foot giant must consume... 5, say, Food-points per day. A human counts as 1 Food, Livestock counts as 3. Each town and village has a population of both humans and their animals, villages have fewer resources for PCs in this fashion but are easier to make demands of, towns usually having a militia or other defence against open threats. <br/>Hopefully you can see how a tentative economy of populations could take place here and forever and always tying Giants to human communities in difficult ways.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429306/#Comment_429306" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-10T05:48:09+00:00" title="March 10, 2014  5:48AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2014 5:49AM by Potemkin.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>- Thugs, outlaws, bullies and berserkers are great characters!

The negotiations between a PC giant and the town sheriff out on the moors about the exchange of livestock for protection is made tense with the knowledge that either side's survival (as a giant or as a community) is dependent on a working solution. I'm not sure which type of character the giants will be yet, but I'd like to take a holistic approach to looking at giant-human ecologies.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429307/#Comment_429307" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-10T06:00:10+00:00" title="March 10, 2014  6:00AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding prior games with similar themes, that's an inconsequential concern in comparison to your own motivation: if a prior game does not break your internal desire to create your own game (which make of course happen when you're sufficiently impressed by prior art; happened to me with TSoY in 2004), then nobody outside is going to mind either, even if it seems like a big deal to you.

Bouncing stuff off the excellent brain trust here.  So whether I'm put off or not by a lack of originality is an interesting proposition - on one hand I have few "darlings" here, so altering my path and diverting my design away from <i>Giants</i> wouldn't be particularly heart wrenching - in fact the constraint could force me into a much more uncomfortable but much more interesting place. Like, what if I eschew the fantasy tropes and instead shifted genre/tone off into a game about Giant robots stalking the verdant plains of Mars searching for their lost masters amidst the overgrown ruins? Or shifted the technical side of things so that instead of being a stand-alone game it's an OSR module for regular-sized PCs arriving on a Gulliver's island of miniature kingdoms? It's not the vanity of breaking new ground that appeals to me, it's the endless creative paths and turns we can take!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens" title="Ironjens"><img alt="Ironjens" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ironjens">Ironjens</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429362/#Comment_429362" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-11T07:08:53+00:00" title="March 11, 2014  7:08AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't know if it'll help or distract, but I've already made it into an embryo of an AW hack <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T4Rjlu5ZDec2dFHV6v5I_mSKyloxuv9WpJ3lVz2ElX4/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T4Rjlu5ZDec2dFHV6v5I_mSKyloxuv9WpJ3lVz2ElX4/edit?usp=sharing</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429368/#Comment_429368" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-11T07:58:51+00:00" title="March 11, 2014  7:58AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Don't know if it'll help or distract, but I've already made it into an embryo of an AW hack <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T4Rjlu5ZDec2dFHV6v5I_mSKyloxuv9WpJ3lVz2ElX4/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T4Rjlu5ZDec2dFHV6v5I_mSKyloxuv9WpJ3lVz2ElX4/edit?usp=sharing</a></blockquote>\nBleedin' cool, Ironjens!

I thought playerbooks would be a neat way to excerbate this in that the Bondgiant would be a hardholder-style character trying to protect a settlement while the other Giants unrelenting hunger would drive them steadily towards it, i.e. having built in tragedy. This is something prevalent in your text as the giants are the last of their kind.<br/><br/>The Provider shows that this doesn't have to be so, but needs more food to feed its offspring, sooner or later leading to territorial clashes. The aim is to have conflict built in from the get go so you can play to find out what is happening.<br/><br/>Ideas I was toying with is having Hunger as one of the base stats instead and having each Giant roll each morning to see if they fly into a rage, kind of like the Hardholder's Wealth move but that felt like it could end up too disruptive.<br/><br/>At least one thing missing (in addition to all the detail work and playtesting and bla bla bla) is a "Big-Things-Happening-In-The-Small-People-World" table allowing for things like famine, civil war, Tulip mania etc to further destablish the dangerous world of Bessex <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>And sleeping giants are cool.

As <i>Game of Thrones</i> teaches us, action for the sake of your children can be the cause of a hundred thousand conflicts. <br/><br/>I don't think hunger should randomly trigger rages, it has to be steadily growing concern that can be reasonably managed if you're pro-active (the danger here, however, is that players can play a long logistics game to farm/share resources and never worry about hunger. Any system has to be one based on scarcity - there should be just enough food that at least one giant is always in danger of rage/sleep. <br/><br/>Evil giants, yes.

And if one giant starts ravaging the others will be nervous.<br/><br/>I'm also thinking of making a lot of random tables for stuff that can happen that will have impact on the giants.<br/><br/>I like AWs play to see what happens so I'm deviating from your historical setting and placing it in the 16th century. England has prospered after the plague. With no shortage of room and the workforce in high demand the humans had a good century which had beneficial results for the Giants too.<br/><br/>But now human population is on the rise with mounting pressures resulting.

I found I was much more interested in the human communities effected by Giants and I think the PCs being these "outsiders" hunting the Giant they get to often be the first new faces on the scene after the whole village has been uttery upturned - for better or worse. That story feels much more fertile than just simulating the travel of Giants across Britain, which I think can still happen, but behind the GM screen. I really like the idea of the GM really having an avatar of problem-causing in the world in the form a Giant; really breaks apart challenge/procedure in a useful way. <br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429773/#Comment_429773" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-23T12:09:18+00:00" title="March 23, 2014 12:09PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds better to me, in almost all respects.

Consider having the players share some authority over the giants, or somehow participate in the giants' struggle as well. Things like the "fortunes" moves for Apocalypse World could be a source of inspiration: maybe there is an economy which determines just how hungry the giants are, and the players must make decisions about what the giants might be doing to deal with their hunger (One-Eye, the terror of East Wales, is up to 5 Hunger - do you choose for him to terrorize a nearby village, demand human sacrifice, or engage in an act of random destruction?), and then they switch into the heads of the giantslayers and have to deal with the problem.<br/><br/>You might also consider an asymmetrical design like <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/462" rel="nofollow">Rock of Tahamaat</a> for inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429776/#Comment_429776" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-23T12:22:00+00:00" title="March 23, 2014 12:22PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes yes, this sounds good!\n<blockquote><br/>You might also consider an asymmetrical design like <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/462" rel="nofollow">Rock of Tahamaat</a> for inspiration.</blockquote>\nI really like asymmetrical design as a concept!

Say what you like about the "wacky gore porn" nature of 0D&amp;D, it at least gave pacifism and talking-it-through a chance. <br/><br/>I like the conceit of Giants being the one magical being in this otherwise historic world.

Maybe this game is me talking about how I feel as a "peasant" watching the huge giants of world events blast through, scattering communities and being the talk on everyone's lips.

They are brutal survivalists at heart and see only opportunity to exploit where we might see valuable community ties. Giants understand human social conventions in the way we might view an ant colony or a family of Meerkats, with comprehension but not participation. Communication is possible but subtly in bargaining, or really any kind of unexpected movement, is simply not advisable: Giants view themselves above the kingdoms of Christendom and express displeasure at perceived disrespect or conspiracy with sudden and brutal action, even against kings. A genuine security concern for the English government is that a Giant might decide to occupy the Tower of London make demands of Westminister. A common political cartoon is of "the King giant" who resembles Charles I and is so "groffly obefe" that the mountains of Wales ride up his britches.  <br/><br/>This game is about communities devastated by an unstoppable force, the force isn't necessarily personal (after all the soldiers of the occupation are people too) but when they do speak it's a terrifying event with lives are at stake.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429846/#Comment_429846" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-24T13:45:33+00:00" title="March 24, 2014  1:45PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2014 1:49PM by Potemkin.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, I think generally Giants are few but largely unstoppable. Historically, I would assume that previous attempts to put down Giants has been seen as trying to fight the tide but perhaps the creation of the New Model Army, thinking about a Nation State as a whole and gunpowder technologies could make interactions with giants akin to a terrible fortress siege or bloody shoot-out. Giants, I predict, are lovers of fights - they are, essentially, the only entertainment available and news of giant-battles summons other giants like flies to a carcass. Literally, in some cases, as the bodies of a giant are a huge source of meat and not easy to dispose of quickly - eyewitness testament of cannibalism at the Council of Trent caused the church to declare Giants outside of God's love. <br/><br/>The main recourse is to turn to professional Giantslayers, who can amass large sums quite quickly in Giant-torn areas and are usually effective in hunting and either driving off or the outright slaying of Giants. It's dangerous work, and you are often torn by conflicting duties - but you can get rich off people's desperation. So that's what happens. <br/><br/><i>Giantslayers of Normandy &amp; France</i> is a spin-off game that involves late 19th Century Giants in the north of France, legionnaires and impressionist painters. I have no idea how Giants deal with the sea. Maybe they build huge "rafts" and sail off to America? <br/><br/>Giants of course a scaled-up humans and have all the squishy weakspots that a cannon-ball would really fuck up. There's a need in my mind for a Giant Injury Table that involves a great number of horrific knee and leg wounds. I see no need to anticipate a video game spin-off and design for that. Giant slaying is a great theme but Attack on Titan handled it in the most niche and conceited way possible. <br/><br/>I feel like the PCs are Giant Slayers and the GM is specifically the Giant. The voices of NPCs and the community is discussed on a more GMful level and roles are picked up and dropped. Maybe the more antagonist NPCs are treated as under the control of the DM, but mostly it's going to be a case of prompts from the text and mechanics helping people discuss the terrible event that's just occurred and to what lengths they are willing to go to get revenge. The farmer might feed your men if you ask, but will his family have enough to eat this winter? Can you continue after the giant without these provisions, knowing that the hopes and fears of many rest on you.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429860/#Comment_429860" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-24T14:50:40+00:00" title="March 24, 2014  2:50PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps I am, or perhaps I'm simply highlighting the giants as more antagonistic figures. <br/><br/>I'd been imaging that Giant Slayers are professionals of charisma who are motivated by a genuine desire to slay giants (and earn a living in doing so, as a ratkiller might).

I want problems to be challengeful and the issues to be human ones; magic smacks of a reliance on technological thinking involving instant and consequence-free solutions to aviate human suffering. Very rarely does the technology of the real world provide this kind of solution, and I don't find it helpful to project it as an escapist power fantasy. This game is very much me saying something about escapist power fantasy D&amp;D and breaking down some of suppositions (about the effectiveness of violence, amongst others) that it has imbued into fantasy-historic gaming. I think the excellent <i>Mouseguard</i> did this to some degree, but I want this to go further and do so by shrinking the players down incredibly in comparison to their obstacles.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429867/#Comment_429867" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-24T15:37:50+00:00" title="March 24, 2014  3:37PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But this is the thing, those stories can totally happen under the auspices of the players literally being giant slayers.

The archery squad, the musket squad, the pike squad, the giant-tripping squad, the medics, etc. So while the players can each control their own individual PC, they can also command/give bonuses/impacts on their squads that wouldn't normally be there.<br/></blockquote>\nOoh, yes please. I feel like taking a giant down is a strategic rather than tactical consideration. Like, you have to motivate a large body of men (often without pay or food immediately available in the burnt earth wake of an enraged giant) to chase down a giant - perusing it without pause to wear it down until, exhausted it can be tripped, bound or slain with pike and grapple (the giant is literally hacked apart by hooks on long poles and harpoons tied to ancient oaks). Slaying a giant with cannon and powder is possible but involves the logistical concerns of manoeuvring artillery across often rough or roadless country and a giant can flee if it judges facing the smoke of little men to be sufficiently painful an experience. Cannon chasing giants is often a process of trying to "snipe" from a hidden location then pursuing an ailing target as he flees. More cunning slayers can kill with few men sneaking in on the giant while he sleeps and plunging pikes into eyes, throat, between libs, abdomen. Climbing a giant would be foolhardy but a brilliant (if suicidal) distraction. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_429874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429874/#Comment_429874" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-24T16:10:16+00:00" title="March 24, 2014  4:10PM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2014 4:11PM by AsIf.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe both bases could be covered by using a Point Pool system?
