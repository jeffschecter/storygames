That's been my default in my medieval-inspired setting... except when my female players specifically request that it comes up!</blockquote>\nThinking back on it, this has often been my approach to gaming, too. Of course misogyny exists in my game worlds and situations (in most real-world or historical settings, anyway; fantasy or science-fiction are situations where I often try to consciously get away from it); however, I try to include lots of exceptions and counterbalancing or contrasting forces or movements. (e.g. Why not make the CEO of a company female and prejudiced against a racial group, instead?) As Eero says, there are far more interesting vices, and those features far more often if a character needs to be made into an unlikeable scapegoat or villain.<br/><br/>Female PCs are a very obvious and common exception to any kind systemic misogyny, and I will never bring prejudice or oppression into play against them unless it's specifically requested by the player. (Much in the same way that I wouldn't have fictional characters making fun of a character for being short or being of a certain race, or exhibiting any other kind of bigotry towards them, unless we had explicitly discussed that being a desirable element of the game at some point.*) <br/><br/>Is your character concept female and powerful, strong, influential? Great; we all accept that and do not challenge it, just as we wouldn't with any other character. If your character concept is a woman who wants to be an astronaut, let's celebrate that instead of trying to invent some misogynistic NPCs who block her progress (we see enough of that in real life; no need to bring it in here). Is your character concept a female who is being oppressed by some kind of prejudice? (Perhaps you just told me that your character wants to be an astronaut, but can't because the hiring committee is full of sexist pigs.) Great, let's play out that struggle and cheer them on.<br/><br/>What are some possible pitfalls or dangers of approaching gaming this way?<br/><br/><br/>*: For instance, a game like <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> explicitly references themes of gender and authority, and a building a Town around "Can a woman be Steward?" is a fruitful and unsurprising course of action. In part this is because the players then get to take - and enforce - a position on this topic. However, I wouldn't bring a narrative about "Can a woman make a good Watchdog?" into the game unless a player created a female Dog and explicitly said this was something they wanted to address.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_458566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458566/#Comment_458566" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-05T04:32:50+00:00" title="December  5, 2016  4:32AM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>What are some possible pitfalls or dangers of approaching gaming this way?</blockquote>\nI'm not saying that this is a major problem, but to me that whole artistic approach reeks of a hidden assumption of traditional game structures. I mean, I could never say things like "I will never bring prejudice into play unless specifically requested by a player", simply because there are so many structural assumptions about the nature of the game implied by that sentence: for that sentiment to make sense you have to be in a position to prescribe content, and the other player has to be in a position to refuse it. This makes sense for a traditional adventure game (specifically, the wish-fulfillment kind), but there are many, many games where a choice like that is not part of the process.<br/><br/>The same goes for "Is your character concept female and powerful, strong, influential? Great; we all accept that and do not challenge it, just as we wouldn't with any other character", it's also a sentiment that only makes sense in a game predicated on celebrating character concepts (most prominently dramatic Sim, in theory terms). Many games, however, are predicated on <i>breaking</i> concepts, so your suggested remedy is at best a hindrance.<br/><br/>Of course there's nothing wrong with the principles you suggest for the games they fit. However, I understood your phrasing to indicate that these should be universal rules of conduct for any game, and I don't see how that could be supported. Many of my favourite games would cease to function with these principles. Thus my observation about those principles being potentially problematic.<br/><br/>I hope it's obvious that I do not support, suggest or condone malicious bullying of players. We <i>might</i> play somewhat rough compared to some, but it's all consensual, and curtailed by boundaries, even if they may not be the same boundaries that some other groups have. The fact that I am not too enthusiastic about some remedies to social ills at the gaming table does not mean that I support the ills themselves; I just prefer remedies that are less prescriptive about the content of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458569/#Comment_458569" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-05T16:37:30+00:00" title="December  5, 2016  4:37PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The same goes for "Is your character concept female and powerful, strong, influential?

I agree with you both, to a large extent.<br/><br/>Eero, I think you took my statement in a more dogmatic fashion than I intended it. (Not your fault; I wasn't terribly clear in my message.) I did not mean to say that a character's given position and authority is static or impossible to challenge; rather, that we would discuss the issue, as Adam suggests (below), instead of assuming that the player will be interested in struggling against misogyny.\n<blockquote><br/>I guess it'd be wise to talk to a player of a female character about <i>how</i> you-as-GM should test those things in a stock fantasy game. Do you want me to test you the same way I'd test a male character? Is this a flag that the character stands out from other women in the game's society, and thus they stick out like a sore thumb and the fun will be in bucking tradition and showing society how to do things right?<br/></blockquote>\nThis is precisely how I would handle this kind of situation. <br/><br/>Many games will, by their nature, bring in assumptions of adversity or of themes that they deal with. (For instance, <i>Apocalypse World</i> constantly tells us that there are threats all around, there are "no status quos", and there are constant reminders of how powerful people can be overthrown or sabotaged, as in the basic moves for the Hardholder, Hocus, and Chopper - "the crowd turns on you", etc.) <br/><br/>If the game I'm playing means that a character in a position of power is challenged, then of course that will be part of play. However, I would not, by default, <b>jump in to challenge them on the basis of their gender</b> unless something in the game's design, setting, or character's fictional position suggests that this is the direction this game should be heading in. (And probably not without a quick chat with the player, unless I know them already and have a sense of what they're into, game-wise.)<br/><br/>If we're playing D&amp;D (which, as far as I know, is silent on the issue of sexism), I would treat a powerful male character in the same way as a powerful female character: they might be challenged in their position of authority or they might not, but in neither case would I suddenly just assume that they are *unwelcome* in that position unless it was something that we had discussed. It would be ludicrous to surprise a player who creates a "warlord" character with, "Hey, by the way, men aren't supposed to lead war-bands in this country, so everyone around is constantly questioning your authority and wants you removed from that position." I seek to apply the same logic to a female character. Unless it's something we've discussed (by virtue of it being present in the game's setting, the game's mechanics, or in the description of the character) I'm not going to challenge her authority to be a warlord on the basis of her being a woman.<br/><br/>To me, the analogous situation would be if we were playing a game of D&amp;D and someone told me they had made a Wizard character. Great! But then they send me an illustration of the character, and - gasp! - he has really dark skin. Do I now bring in a bunch of racist NPCs, who will hurl bigotry at this Wizard? Lord, no. <br/><br/>Now, if the game or setting includes some themes of racism, then it's time to have a chat with the player. Where does the character come from? Has he ever experienced oppression? Is this something you'd like to see in the game, or not? Etc.<br/><br/>Of course, I'm hashing this all out in public right now (not the smartest idea!); I don't claim to have a definitive position on this, or even a terribly well thought-out one. But this is how I've handled this kind of thing as far back as I can remember in my mature, adult gaming life - I'm describing it in retrospective, rather than prescribing a course of action for others to follow.\n<blockquote><br/>How about the risk of white-washing problems out of a setting? That might be more <br/>offensive to some people than including the troubling elements. "You removed slavery from your 1800's South setting? Seriously?!"</blockquote>\nThat's an excellent point.

This is relevant, because that's exactly the sort of situation where one is justified in questioning the arbitrariness of e.g. sexism in the setting: why ever are we playing in a setting that makes it more difficult for my character, just because I want to play a girl? This is a good question, why indeed - is the GM being arbitrarily misogynist by insisting that the setting has a sexist bias? The more influence the GM has on the game's arbitrary setting, the more pressing this question becomes.<br/><br/>However, thinking about my own gaming experience, I think that this kind of arbitrary background setting fiction is somewhat rare for me. I have definitely participated in games that prioritize other stuff, like most prominently certain flavours of D&amp;D, where it is not rare for the GM to be actively agnostic about the wider setting, because the game's focus is on e.g. character builds and dungeon architecture, and it doesn't really matter in what kind of setting all this takes place. However, this kind of game is a clear minority in the totality of my experience of roleplaying.<br/><br/>The dominant experience for me, then, is that a game's themes and setting form a complex, literarily ambitious interweaved whole, often with many parallel artistic motivations driving play. This, makes choices about the setting and how it reflects into play anything but arbitrary. If, while gaming like that, a politically charged issue comes up, it is generally speaking not because the GM is arbitrarily bullying some player, but rather because the internal logic of the piece of art we're working on demands it.<br/><br/>For example, consider gaming in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth. Say that we're playing something like MERP, and I'm GMing, and I'm a huge fan of the legendarium. The other players appreciate it as well, and they like how I'm able to slather setting detail everywhere, because I know my stuff. Everybody appreciates the aesthetics of the timeless fantasy world and its familiar places and people. Now, are we going to just ignore the fact that Middle-Earth has historical-like social structures, with gender-based social roles? Will we rebuild Middle-Earth into a non-genderized version for the sake of playing the game? Or would that, perhaps, take something away from the artistic goals of the exercise?<br/><br/>Due to the way that thematic meaning interfaces with creative goals in roleplaying, my experience is that I cannot separate liberal political values from the actual gameplay in the way generally advocated in these sorts of discussions: I can either play a safe pollyanna game that sanctifies and prioritizes the immersive safety of the players, or I can play a game with incisive artistic content, but I do not know how to do both at the same time. I appreciate that the former is popular, and that e.g. the popularity of MMORPGs has made it the default assumption of what roleplaying even is, but for me it's a minority of my play experience and interests. We can talk all we want about how every game should be arbitrarily molded around the player characters and their social positions, but from my viewpoint that just looks parochial - it elevates a specialized type of wish-fulfillment into the main raison d'etre of the entire hobby.<br/><br/>I'd like to note that what I describe above has been pretty much acknowledged (in in passing) by everybody in this discussion, starting with that article at the top, so I'm not complaining that it's being disregarded in that sense. I just wanted to emphasize that what the article brushes off as "Include misogyny if it is important to your game", in a relatively curt manner, is in fact an ordinary part of the artistic process, at least for me: misogyny is part of historical human condition, just like many other ills, and I am about as likely to remove it from the fictional tapestry as I am to remove stealing. I think that discussing this topic in a way that focuses solely on the self-fulfillment of the players is basically biased and unlikely to capture the entire issue in an even-handed way: as far as I understand the primary question is not whether your game includes misogyny, but rather whether your group manages to have honest creative coordination. If players are not coerced into playing games with misogyny (or other displeasing themes), then a problem does not exist; therefore the issue is whether people are really playing games they want to play, and not that games are being designed or GMed wrong.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458582/#Comment_458582" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-06T15:54:42+00:00" title="December  6, 2016  3:54PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really struggle with this stuff.<br/><br/>I'm running a social justice sandbox called City of Brass. It deals with all kinds of social issues, including racism, classicism, poverty, but I haven't really touched on sexism or misogyny or sexual assault. <br/><br/>On the one hand, I am sensitive to the idea that people don't want sexual assault in their fantasy games. They might not want racism in it, either.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I fear that someone will say, "What, you're tackling the problems of racism but misogyny doesn't warrant a hard look?"<br/><br/>So far, no one has said that. And no one has bristled at the racism, because I handle it sensitively, with much ironic awareness, as a critique (not a celebration) of it. It's a social justice game.<br/><br/>In the first session of it that I ran, Jabari Weathers was playing a tiefling bard who traveled across the city to see an old friend. Now that he was down on his luck, his noble patron was way less cool about him just showing up at her place. I vividly remember Jabari laughing out loud and shaking his head, saying, "Microaggressions.

But that's beside the point right now.<br/><br/>Like anything else, it depends on how you do it, and I will be honest and say that, for me, "We'll handle it sensitively" is not reassurance enough. What does "handle it sensitively" mean, and how is each person's idea of what that means influenced by their own experience or lack thereof? Misogyny, racism, antisemitism, homophobia, transphobia, and so on, aren't just a historical fact. They're people's current lived reality, and treating that with respect sometimes means not going there, or, at the very least, not assuming a position of authority on the topic.<br/><br/>But let's say you do go there in your game. I believe we can take a page out of the BDSM book and be overt about what our play will and will not include. Maybe even come up with safewords.

My own answer is not specific to misogyny, but I think it applies just as much as it does to other social issues: thematic play (and narrative art in general) needs to be an honest effort at piercing the veils of thoughtlessness and comfortable half-truths. Do not stain yourself with the sin of lazy thinking. This means, among other things, taking an even-handed look at societal misogyny and playing it out as it comes, to your best understanding, within the conceits of the piece you're working on. The "you" is collective here, so this goes for the entire group engaged in the endeavour. As was my basic point about this matter, my answer presumes that this is something we want to do: if we do not, let's not play a game where being truthful to human nature is a creative cornerstone of the enterprise.<br/><br/>In a hypothetical Middle-Earth game this would mean, for me, that we're playing in a setting where the very laws of nature are, to a degree, romantically paternalistic: this is a world ruled by a pantheon of gods divided by gender and task, a world where the nobility of a man is to act, and the nobility of a woman is to to be. Meanwhile the people themselves are supposedly the same as they ever were. The contradiction between human nature and the divine law is in no way foreign to the genre, so the obvious take for me would be to explore women stepping out of their gender in terms of tragedy (classical) and unexpected grace (Christian). Most importantly: yes, definitely play women in my Middle-Earth game, and definitely we'll get interesting play out of that - but please do not expect me to pretend that the character is not woman, it's much too important a detail for Tolkien's brand of mythic fantasy to ignore.<br/><br/>One might ask why we would want to struggle with the contradictions like this, but I think it's one of the interesting things you can do with roleplaying. For instance, running a patriarchal world when the players do not believe in those precepts is a great way to enjoy speculative fiction. It is an alien world and mind-set, and you can explore it to discover things. For instance: can people be happy in this world? What even <i>is</i> it like to be a man or a woman in a world born of the fantasies of a conservative a hundred years back?<br/><br/>(A women's issues Middle-Earth campaign would be a great idea, by the way. Consider: women for Tolkien are almost so holy as to be outside the moral axis altogether. What would an actually mortally flawed female protagonist even look like? Would the precepts of the setting automatically require us to monsterize such a female, as Tolkien does with Ungoliant and Shelob? On the other hand, is it possible for a woman in Middle-Earth to be a hero in an active sense, or is a fundamentally passive, supportive role a necessity for a woman to be considered good? What if you break these thematic, divine and societal expectations, what would Boromir think? How about Gandalf?)\n<blockquote>But let's say you do go there in your game. I believe we can take a page out of the BDSM book and be overt about what our play will and will not include. Maybe even come up with safewords. It all goes back to this: people are more important than play.</blockquote>\nYes, this is the solution for me - not a blanket ban of certain issues, but taking care about playing responsibly together, to joint purposes.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
