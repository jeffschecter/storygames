I'm really pleased with how it turned out and I couldn't have done it without you!<br/><br/>Original post below:<br/><br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Hi folks! I wanted to share what I've been working on of late: A Harry Potter tabletop RPG, designed with the Apocalypse Engine.<br/><br/>The entire game, in its current rough-draft beta form, is here for your perusal: <del><a href="https://bit.ly/2CeUupN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://bit.ly/2CeUupN</a></del><br/><br/>This was a bit of an impulse project \u2013 I was talking about Harry Potter with one of my regular gaming groups and we were all shocked to discover that there\u2019s never been an official Harry Potter RPG. And then someone suggested we should make our own, and, well, here we are.<br/><br/>Now, I\u2019m aware that there are a few Potterverse RPGs floating around out there. However, I found that most of them were either too caught up in minutia (course credits, monetary systems, character inventory) or too beholden to D&amp;D-like systems with detailed rules about skills, spell effects, and combat &amp; movement. None of these things <i>feel</i> like a Harry Potter story. Harry Potter stories are about waving wands to make fantastical things happen, using your wits to solve mysteries, bravely facing danger, sneaking around &amp; finding out what the adults don\u2019t want you to know, and standing with your friends against the darkness.<br/><br/>There is also at least one other Harry Potter PbtA game that I\u2019m aware of, but I wanted to try doing it my way. I\u2019m hoping I can take some lessons from this for future PbtA projects.<br/><br/>The main design \u201chook\u201d of this game, as I see it, is that each character stat (and the relationship stat) represents one of the virtues of the four Hogwarts houses. So everything in the game revolves around the concepts of Bravery, Intellect, Cunning, and Loyalty. There\u2019s also an independent stat for Magic, because in the books &amp; films you can be a skilled witch or wizard regardless of your House affiliation.<br/><br/>So that\u2019s the set up. I have four goals for this project:<br/><br/>1. The game should be simple enough that anyone can pick it up and start playing with no prep, including kids as young as 10.<br/>2. The game should create stories that feel like the Harry Potter books and movies \u2013 tonally, thematically, and structurally.<br/>3. The game should include all the stuff that Harry Potter fans love about the world \u2013 wands and fake Latin and Houses and Quidditch and patronuses and so on.<br/>4. The game should be pretty tightly focused on students at a magical boarding school (even if there\u2019s a lot of other stuff going on in the broader setting).<br/><br/>I\u2019m happy to talk about how I attempted to fulfill those goals in more detail, if people are interested.<br/><br/>My specific questions are:<br/><br/>- How well does the current design fulfill my project goals and what can I do to make it fulfill them better?<br/>- Is there anything important missing from the game, either mechanically, explanatorily, or setting-wise?<br/>- Is there anything extraneous in the game?<br/>- Do the moves make sense? Are they explained well?<br/>- How is the short how-to-play explanation at the end? Do you feel like you could run the game based off of it?<br/><br/>That said, any kind of feedback or critique would be greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve run one playtest of this so far, which is what the how-to-play writeup is based on. I\u2019ll post a follow-up in this thread with a summary of that session, for anyone who\u2019s interested.<br/><br/>Thanks for taking the time to read &amp; look!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476547/#Comment_476547" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-09-04T15:43:19+00:00" title="September  4, 2018  3:43PM">September 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright. this is nice. I will talk about the 10% of glass that is empty : the Quidditch rules. You cannot for the love of anything sacred have a "6-: nothing happens" in a PbtA game. Also, I would make the whole Quidditch game a small table making it clear that it's one roll per character per match. And maybe one extra roll if you are Harry Potter.Because the number of rolls is going to be the main resource for me if I am a player in a game like that. Consider awarding experience for pupils that face the forces of evil. <br/>Also : where are the booklets for the different types and their moves ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476550/#Comment_476550" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-09-04T17:49:31+00:00" title="September  4, 2018  5:49PM">September 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't read this fully yet, but I am going to be perusing it with great interest as time permits.

I\u2019m using The Warren as a reference point. In the Warren, you\u2019re a rabbit. That\u2019s it. The game is about being a rabbit. In this game, you\u2019re a student wizard, and that\u2019s it.<br/><br/>The second reason is I think multiple playbooks would complicate the game too much. My goal is to get the players into a Harry Potter style story quickly, which is easier if all the players are basically playing off the same move set.<br/><br/>That said, I am considering giving each of the four Houses a special move. But I have absolutely no idea what those should be. Open to suggestions!<br/><br/>With the Quidditch rules: I tried to write out the team position moves such that a player failure means things actively go well for the other team. But the \u201cnothing happens\u201d in the Cheer &amp; Jeer move is no good, I see now.<br/><br/>I\u2019m curious to know more about what you mean by the number of rolls being your main resource &amp; limiting the match to 1 roll per player. Because I was definitely envisioning playing through a \u201cfull\u201d Quidditch match, with players rolling whenever they say their character does something on the field. Of course, something plot-relevant should always happen in the midst of a Quidditch game \u2013 it\u2019s never \u201cjust\u201d a match. But maybe I need to make that more explicit?<br/><br/>Anyway, very much appreciate the critiques! Some definite gaps to fill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DBB" title="DBB"><img alt="DBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/542/nRJ4FIVD3GGO6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DBB">DBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476556/#Comment_476556" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-09-04T23:06:01+00:00" title="September  4, 2018 11:06PM">September 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Airk">@Airk</a> \u2013 Thanks!

I'm also working on a magical school based rpg, not specifically Harry Potter though but definitely inspired by (along with things like the Magicians, Bartimaeus trilogy, Jonathan Strange Mr Norrel but generally keeping with the themes of HP). It's called Thornwood: School of Magic. I agree with your criticisms of the existing Harry Potter RPG's, I noticed similar things when starting to create my RPG. Way back at the start it was a pbta game too but I did a full redesign and it's more of a hybrid between that, blades in the dark, gumshoe, and all sorts of my own ideas now.<br/><br/>I'm personally not a fan of the houses they are sorted into giving them a mechanical bonus, but that's mainly because I think the game goes a lot smoother when everyone playing is in the same house and so everyone getting the same bonus is perhaps redundant. Maybe if the mechanical bonuses were more thematic than just a straight +1 to a stat, giving access to something specific. I do like having the stats be related to the houses though, and I've done something similar in my game.<br/><br/>The layout is really clean and nice.<br/><br/>Interesting to see that you've gone with a list of spells. It definitely would be fun to choose from the list and it's presented in a great way, for my game i've gone with a very simple freeform magic system but I'll probably include some example spells.<br/><br/>"If  another  student  teaches  you  a  spell,  you  must  successfully  roll  to  learn  something  and  they  must  successfully  roll  to  aid  someone" This doubling up on the roll doesn't feel very PbtA to me, what happens if one player successfully learns but the other play fails to aid? I think one or the other would be fine.<br/><br/>I like the luck mechanic.<br/><br/>Resting in your dorm heals you faster than Recuperating in the hospital wing? 24 hours vs 16 hours. It's not clear what "up to 2 harm" means. Can I spend 16 hours in the dorm to clear 2 harm, leave for 1 minute (so the hours are no longer consecutive) and then come back and clear 2 more harm the next 16 hours?  It's unclear when the 2 harm limit resets or if its meant to at all.<br/><br/>It's unclear to me also how the conversation is meant to go for the quidditch rules. I'm not really sure how I'd run a match using those rules.<br/><br/>Is the NPC points meant to be a chart you roll on to find out the total number of points each house got independent of the players? I was wondering how you would determine that the players won the house cup, cos it isn't really spelled out anywhere but I suppose that is it. I like the idea of a mechanical benefit for winning the house cup, makes the players invested in gaining/losing house points.<br/><br/>Looking pretty slick so far, can't say there was anything that really stood out to me but it looks like a good start for a PbtA harry potter.<br/><br/>My rules aren't as well laid out as yours yet but if anyone is interested in them I can PM them to you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DaveC" title="DaveC"><img alt="DaveC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DaveC">DaveC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476559/#Comment_476559" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-09-05T03:44:12+00:00" title="September  5, 2018  3:44AM">September 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this looks neat, DBB. <br/><br/>This isn't an in-depth critique, just a couple of things that jumped out at me:<br/><br/>1) I don't think there's enough in the character generation to end up with distinct characters. True, people can distinguish based on personality, but there's not even a section to tell people to think about that. If you want interesting group dynamics like in the books, then you will want to direct the players to think about this. Maybe this could be done with some kind of Aspect add-on. So one person is "Fated, famous boy wizard". One is "Know-it-all". One is "Overlooked impoverished middle child". One is "Weird girl from odd family". I dunno, it just seems like there's a hole here.<br/><br/>2) Maybe there should be a mechanical distinction for different backgrounds? Muggle-born get +2 to Muggle Studies rolls, Pure-bloods get something else.<br/><br/>3) Luck getting you an automatic 10+ seems pretty powerful. Guess it depends on how long a season is, and how many important rolls are likely to come up.<br/><br/>4) Speaking of which, the Quidditch rules don't really work for me. A large part of that is that you're saddled with what's honestly a pretty ridiculous game to model, especially if you really want the play-by-play of individual maneuvers. I'd recommend either dealing with the thing more abstractly as a single big conflict roll or... something else. I dunno. As it stands, I don't see any reason why the Seeker player wouldn't immediately make the Catch the Golden Snitch move, spend a point of luck (or get the Announcer to goose their roll) and wrap up the game in ten seconds. I know PbtA doesn't really do opposed rolls, but there's nothing in here to be able to play out a rivalry vs. an enemy Seeker, for example.<br/>Again, I think Quidditch in the books is nonsensical, so maybe there's no way to translate that into an RPG and get beyond that.<br/><br/>5) Are there any spells that form kind of a freshman-year basic set? I'm thinking Lumos and Accio at least? It doesn't seem to fit the canon to be in a group where only one person knows how to light up their wand. Or maybe the idea is to play through that learning?<br/><br/>6) In the "Ask Some Questions" section, it seems to me that a big question that needs answering is whether this game is going to take place in a universe where all of the Harry Potter books have also happened, or are happening. Or whether this is a fresh copy without all of that. Particularly if you want this to be accessible to children, you'll very quickly get players wanting to go talk to Harry, or Dumbledore, or Hagrid. Are they around? It could be that's a different decision for each group rather than something the game dictates, but it ought to be addressed up front.<br/><br/>I feel like there's a good core here, and I share your belief that a PbtA type system is going to be better at producing the kind of fiction you want rather than something that's very detail-oriented with skills, spells and the like. <br/><br/>It might be a bigger change than you want, but you could consider dropping Harm altogether and replace it with something more like the Conditions in MASKS, another PbtA game. In the books any sort of physical harm is generally temporary and healed at the speed that the plot requires. But emotional states are very real and really drive the plot. Half of the events in the books happen because someone is Angry, or Insecure, or Suspicious and therefore does something stupid. It'd be nice if your game captured that side of things.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DBB" title="DBB"><img alt="DBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/542/nRJ4FIVD3GGO6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DBB">DBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476563/#Comment_476563" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-09-05T15:32:25+00:00" title="September  5, 2018  3:32PM">September 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/rhysmakesthings">@rhysmakesthings</a> \u2013 Cool! Seems like we\u2019re working on parallel projects, though I\u2019d wager yours has more breadth and depth to it. Feel free to use anything I\u2019ve done if it strikes your fancy. I\u2019d love to take a look at the Thornwood rules, too! Obviously I wouldn\u2019t use anything without your explicit permission.<br/><br/>Regarding the House stat bonuses \u2013 my line of thought is it represents a character\u2019s natural inclination towards a specific virtue (which would be the reason they were sorted into that House). So a Gryffindor should naturally be a little braver, a Ravenclaw a little smarter, etc. I specifically want the game to work with PCs spread amongst multiple Houses, which makes the bonus more useful. I\u2019m in the middle of a multiple-House playtest, so we\u2019ll see how it goes. Definitely open to other suggestions for House bonuses, though!<br/><br/>Good call on the spell learning rule; I\u2019ll simplify that.<br/><br/>With the resting, I should clarify that it only restores the first 2 Harm, representing minor injuries. If you\u2019ve taken more than 2, it shouldn\u2019t restore. I also don\u2019t see the 16-hours-and-1-minute thing as a cheat, but you\u2019d definitely get in trouble for staying in your dorm for 16 hours and missing all your classes. I should add that to the move as well.<br/><br/>It seems like the Quidditch rules are the weakest part of the design. I\u2019m envisioning a Quidditch match working similar to a bout in World Wide Wrestling (which is why I stole the Announcer move from there). But I may need to do a complete rewrite to achieve that.<br/><br/>You\u2019ve got it exactly right with the House Cup. Presumably everyone else in the school is winning and losing points off-screen, so you roll at the end of the year and add all the points the PCs have accumulated in play.

I\u2019d been assuming that players would do that automatically, but formalizing it in character creation is a good idea.<br/><br/>Definitely interested in mechanical functions for backgrounds, but I\u2019ve been totally stumped on what they should be. I\u2019m don\u2019t want to make too many things roll bonuses. Open to suggestions.<br/><br/>Luck is super powerful, for sure. I\u2019m cribbing the Monster of the Week rules for this, but it hasn\u2019t come up in playtesting yet. Worth keeping an eye on.<br/><br/>The Quidditch rules, as mentioned elsewhere, are clearly the weakest part of the game. I probably need to rewrite from scratch. All of your points here are valid.<br/><br/>For spells, right now you get one from each category to start and then learn through play &amp; advancement. If it goes weird in playtesting I\u2019ll change it.<br/><br/>It actually never occurred to me that players wouldn\u2019t want the game to take place in the same continuity as the books &amp; movies. My playtest group decided to set their story in the present day, and already made McGonagall the headmaster and the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher a Lestrange. I did have a partially completed \u201ccharacters you might encounter\u201d list, but scrapped it for space. Is it worth restoring that? Or should I just add a note somewhere?<br/><br/>I\u2019ll have to take a closer look at the Masks Conditions \u2013 I was mostly looking at it for moves &amp; MC stuff when designing this. I\u2019d like Harm to broadly encompass physical &amp; psychological damage, but I\u2019m not sure if that will work in practice. To be fair, characters in the books/films do get badly injured on a regular basis, though I like where you\u2019re going with the emotional states. Maybe there\u2019s a way to do both?<br/><br/>Thanks for the critiques!

You can still narrate someone having the bones in their arm turn into jelly, but it's up to the GM and players to decide whether that means the person can't fly a broomstick or whatever.<br/><br/>The thing that I really like about the Conditions in Masks is that they drive play in a couple of different ways at the same time. First, you've got adjectives applied to your character that you can just use for straight roleplaying. You're feeling Hopeless, so you can roleplay that out in your decisions. Second, there's a mechanical penalty to a single Move for each Condition. You're less effective at a particular thing if you're suffering from this particular mindset. Third, there are specific player Moves to support your teammates and thereby remove Conditions -- and if you roll well enough, you can knock off one of your own as well. Sometimes the best way to stop being Afraid is to try to buck up someone else.<br/><br/>Finally, and I think this is the part that applies best to your game, is that each Condition has an action that you can take to clear it on your own, and these actions drive the game forward. To clear Angry, you "hurt someone or break something important". To clear Insecure, you "take a foolhardy action without talking to your team". This seems to be to be precisely on point to fit the Hogwarts fiction, although you'd probably want to pick different actions. Perhaps "To clear Rebellious, withhold important information from a trusted authority figure", or the like. It's a way to have the players do the kind of sub-optimal things that the characters in the book do while giving them a rule to point to that justifies it.<br/><br/>Next to all of that having what's basically a hit point system seems kind of flavorless to me. Especially since healing physical injuries in the book is all over the map, mechanically. Sometimes it's a simple wand swipe to cure a near fatal injury, sometimes it's a week of bed rest to get over a bump on the head.

I\u2019m having a tough time with this, because you guys have certainly convinced me that a Conditions system is a good match for the fiction. The back-and-forth of gaining and clearing Conditions based on roleplaying really does support the kind of Potter-style story I want this game to generate. And the way that the mechanics, the storytelling, and the roleplaying interact seems decidedly elegant. But I still have reservations.<br/><br/>There first is that I\u2019m concerned that dropping an HP-style system altogether will confuse new players. Everybody <i>gets</i> hit points \u2013 they\u2019re in the majority of video games and mainstream RPGs already. Even the current setup, with just 7 points, will be a stretch for some people. I don\u2019t want someone picking up the game and immediately going, \u201cI don\u2019t get this. There\u2019s no way to get hurt so there\u2019s no danger or challenge.\u201d (Which is obviously incorrect, but I\u2019m considering impressions, not actualities.)<br/><br/>The second is that I don\u2019t think younger players will be interested in the Conditions system the way we are. For them, the game is going to be much more about the wish fulfillment of running around a magical boarding school with wands and the challenge of overcoming the forces of darkness. I don\u2019t want to interfere with that style of play by forcing them into a Monsterhearts-style game about emotional turmoil and interpersonal conflict (As much as I\u2018d like to ensure that style of play is viable for older players).<br/><br/>So I don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019m going to have to run the game for a bit with the Harm system, then for a bit with the Conditions system, and see how it plays and how players like it. That seems like the only way to really figure out which I\u2019d prefer to codify into the game rules. But I\u2019m definitely interested in trying it out!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DBB" title="DBB"><img alt="DBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/542/nRJ4FIVD3GGO6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DBB">DBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476603/#Comment_476603" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-09-07T13:03:08+00:00" title="September  7, 2018  1:03PM">September 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2018 1:03PM by DBB.">edited September 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, I\u2019ve revised the Quidditch rules down to two moves. Playing a Quidditch match is now all about passing narrative control from player to player, while the GM gets control over when the match ends by saying when the Snitch appears.<br/><br/>The moves are:\n<blockquote><b>Play a Quidditch Match</b><br/><br/>When you play a Quidditch match, pick one of the following positions: Beater, Chaser, Keeper, Seeker, Announcer, or Fan.<br/><br/>The Narrator will pick a player to start with control of the match (usually the player with the least Experience currently marked). When you have control of the Quidditch match, you get to say what happens on the pitch.<br/><br/>Describe the match up until your team is about to score, then <b>roll</b>\u2026<br/><br/><b>+Bravery</b> if your team scores by making a daring play.<br/><b>+Intellect</b> if your team scores by playing tactically, roll +Intellect.<br/><b>+Cunning</b> if your team scores by playing dirty.<br/><b>+your Loyalty</b> to a teammate if you help your team score by supporting that teammate.<br/><br/><b>On a 10+</b>, your team scores for 10 points and you keep control of the match!<br/><b>On a 7-9</b>, pick one:<br/>Your team scores for 10 points and you pass control of the match to the player to your left.<br/>Your team misses the goal, but you keep control of the match.<br/><b>On a 6-</b>, mark a point of Experience. Your team fails to score and the Narrator describes how:<br/>The other team scores for 10 points.<br/>OR<br/>You take Harm in the attempt.<br/>Then, you pass control of the match to the player to your left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><b>Catch the Golden Snitch</b><br/><br/>At some point during the match, the Narrator will announce that one of the Seekers has spotted the Golden Snitch. If you are your team\u2019s Seeker, you gain narrative control of the match.<br/><br/>Describe the match up until you're about to catch the Golden Snitch, then <b>roll</b>\u2026<br/><br/><b>+Bravery</b> if you make a daring maneuver to catch the Snitch.<br/><b>+Intellect</b> if you outwit the other Seeker to catch the Snitch.<br/><b>+Cunning</b> if you sabotage the other Seeker to catch the Snitch.<br/><b>+your Loyalty</b> to a teammate if that teammate helps you catch the Snitch.<br/><br/><b>On a 10+</b>, you do it! You catch the Golden Snitch and end the match, giving your team 150 points.<br/><b>On a 7-9</b>, you're not able to catch the Golden Snitch, but neither is the other team\u2019s Seeker. The Narrator hands control of the match to another player.<br/><b>On a 6-</b>, mark a point of Experience. You fail to catch the Golden Snitch and the Narrator describes how:<br/>You take Harm in the attempt.<br/>OR<br/>The other Seeker catches the Snitch and ends the match, giving the other team 150 points.<br/>If the match is still going, the Narrator passes control of the match to another player.</blockquote>\nObviously, heavy influence/theft from World Wide Wrestling here. I\u2019m also thinking that there should be a Quidditch Sheet with the moves, the in-fiction rules, and team rosters. This would get physically passed from player to player when they passed narrative control.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DaveC" title="DaveC"><img alt="DaveC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DaveC">DaveC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476604/#Comment_476604" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-09-07T13:36:41+00:00" title="September  7, 2018  1:36PM">September 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hear you on the hit points. Trying it out seems like the best way to go. I do think that designing a game for 10 year olds vs. designing a game for adults, especially adults with gaming experience, is a challenge. After all, different people get different things out of the books too. So let us know how the trials go.<br/><br/>I like these new Quidditch rules much better. I really like the GM controlling the timing of the Snitch arrival as a way of setting the length of the game. A couple of questions, though. <br/><br/>- Does this assume that all of the players are playing on the same team? Passing control to the player on your left is a huge difference if it's just switching who gets to narrate and roll dice, versus switching which team gets to score points.<br/><br/>- Rolling a 7 or above on 2d6 is around a 60%. If you're using an attribute you've got a +1 in (and why wouldn't you) then it's around 72%. So that's the percentage for getting 10 points when you've got control. If all of the PC's are on the same team then it seems like you're going to have that team score 3/4 of the points, no matter who they're playing, until the Snitch comes out.<br/>That could be what you want, fictionally. But it effectively rules out the come-from-behind victories that you see in the books. Maybe this only works if you have two players, one on each team?<br/><br/>I think the thing you're running up against here is that you're simulating a sort of balanced back and forth 2-sided competition in a system where one of the principles is that the GM, who normally plays the opposition, doesn't roll. <br/><br/>Maybe on a 7-9 nobody scores, but you do one of those Apocalypse World Hobson's Choice things:<br/>On a 7-9, pick one:<br/>- One of your Chasers gets hit by a Bludger! Take -1 on your team's next roll<br/>- Your Keeper is out of position! Take -1 on your team's next roll<br/>- One of your Beaters is distracted by the crowd! Take -1 on your team's next roll<br/>- One of your players is injured! Substitute in one of your backups. If you don't have any, you forfeit the match. (Is this even a thing in the books? I don't remember.)<br/>...<br/><br/>So it's all bad stuff, but gives you a little something to narrate about. Scores only happen on 10+ (for you) or 6- (for the enemy team). Given that you're adding in an ability score when you roll, it should balance out the general negative tilt of the field here. The general flow would be a series of adverse events, punctuated by occasional scores despite the setbacks.<br/><br/>With this system you'd just pass the dice every turn, regardless of the outcome, so everybody gets to play.<br/><br/><br/>Also, looking at the new rules makes me wonder again whether just making Loyalty a fourth stat throughout the game might not be a good idea. You'd treat it the same as everything else instead of using it as the Strings/Hx thing. But that's a pretty big change from what you've got going so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DBB" title="DBB"><img alt="DBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/542/nRJ4FIVD3GGO6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DBB">DBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476619/#Comment_476619" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-09-08T22:07:41+00:00" title="September  8, 2018 10:07PM">September 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All of that makes a lot of sense, especially when you lay out the math like that. I like the idea that you only actually score on a 10+, with the 7-9s all being things that go wrong (but not so wrong that the other team scores). Can I use some of your suggestions verbatim?<br/><br/>I\u2019m hoping there\u2019s some way to get this to work equally well when all the players are on one team AND all on different teams. But the problem you cite about simulating a symmetrical game inside an asymmetrical game is a big problem, for sure.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve been going back and forth about Loyalty as a regular stat vs a relationship stat the whole time I\u2019ve been doing this. I think in my gut I want it to be a regular stat, but it also feels *wrong* to have a PbtA game without a relationship mechanic. My latest thought: What if Loyalty is a regular stat and instead of giving other characters a score you can mark them as a \u201cfriend\u201d or \u201crival\u201d, which gives you +1 to Loyalty rolls involving them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_476620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DaveC" title="DaveC"><img alt="DaveC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DaveC">DaveC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476620/#Comment_476620" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-09-09T01:02:33+00:00" title="September  9, 2018  1:02AM">September 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please feel free to take anything you like; I'm enjoying the kibitzing.<br/><br/>I agree with you that there should still be some mechanism to tie together characters.

Because how do Harry Potter books work structurally? - They will show you some new piece of magic at the beginning of the book, which will be used in the final showdown either by the protagonists or by the bad guys.<br/><br/>What did they use in the first book to solve all the riddles? Alohomora, broom riding, herbology etc. By starting out with a defined spell list, you basically shoot down the structure that made Harry Potter work. That is also the reason there is no Harry Dresden PbtA. There is Urban Shadows of course which is very much like the Dresden Files structurally, thematically and tonally, but it doesn't get hung up on its minutiae.<br/><br/>But, let's talk theme. What are the themes in Harry Potter? Parental abuse, poverty, prejudice/racism, sibling rivalry, monastic problems, bad authority figures. Most of those are shown by specific characters. So yeah, do have playbooks. PbtA playbooks are about themes. Harry, Hermione, Ron, Draco, Neville, Luna, Cho, the Patil twins, they make great playbooks. They are not all <i>just wizards</i>. Actually, them being wizards doesn't even matter.<br/><br/>OK. Moves. Moves are a way to encode typical elements into a handy format. So, for one thing, it's a school. I'd expect something about lessons and or teachers there. Then, Hogwarts is a big and myterious place. So something about living a magic castle. The Hogwarts system is terribly competitive: House points! The characters regularly engage in the Wizards' version of pop culture. <br/><br/>Oh, and you can bin the Rest move.

I\u2019d been thinking the only way to do them would be for each House to have a playbook, which I explicitly don\u2019t want. But basing them on specific characters from the books/movies is smart.<br/><br/>I think we have a difference of opinion on how these stories are structured, though. I see the structure being less about learning new magic and having it pay off later and more about progressively unraveling a mystery. The spells are just plot devices, not structural components. (You can tell this because you can swap them around and the story remains the same \u2013 getting past a 3-headed dog with a music spell isn\u2019t fundamentally different than getting past it with, say, an invisibility spell.)<br/><br/>The way I see it, the structure is:<br/><br/>1. The protagonists see or experience a series of strange events which raise a bunch of questions (What was the object of the robbery at Gringotts? Who is Nicholas Flamel? Where was Snape during the troll attack?)<br/>2. The characters try to answer their questions, get into tremendous trouble, and arrive at an incorrect conclusion about what\u2019s going on (Snape is trying to steal the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone for himself).<br/>3. Finally, the characters find the final piece of information that reveals what\u2019s *really* happening (Quirrell is trying to steal the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone for Voldemort).<br/><br/>That structure doesn\u2019t interfere with all the cool setting trappings that people love \u2013 in fact, it enhances them because the familiar elements can be applied to the familiar structure in new and fun ways.<br/><br/>As for the moves, they\u2019re designed to focus player behavior and attention. Sitting in class is the least interesting part of the Hogwarts experience, so it doesn\u2019t get a move. There are lots of ways to interact with a magic castle, so those ideas are split across several moves. And House Points are awarded and deducted by teachers, so that\u2019s a GM move. In general, I want the smallest set of moves possible, so as not to overload young or new players.<br/><br/>I\u2019m also not entirely convinced by the rest move. Any alternate ideas for mechanisms to recover harm?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_476718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rhysmakesthings" title="rhysmakesthings"><img alt="rhysmakesthings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rhysmakesthings">rhysmakesthings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/476718/#Comment_476718" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-09-19T02:19:22+00:00" title="September 19, 2018  2:19AM">September 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something I've played with for resting / hospital wing type stuff in my game is making multiple different actions that are different to but just as useful as the ones that you can take outside of that context.

I wanted to let you all know that I\u2019ll be taking Hogwarts: An RPG to Metatopia 2018 for playtesting. If you\u2019re going and you have any interest in trying the game, please sign up for a session! I believe the full convention schedule releases this Sunday, the 28th.<br/><br/>I also wanted to post a link to the current version of the game: <a href="https://bit.ly/2CeUupN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://bit.ly/2CeUupN</a><br/><br/>I\u2019ve been playtesting with a rotating group for the past two months, and the current game is pretty different than the version I initially shared here. Some of the biggest changes:<br/><br/>\u2022  I added a Conditions system, borrowed from Masks. This is now my playtesters\u2019 favorite part of the game; everyone loves the push and pull of getting emotional Conditions on a failed roll and narratively clearing them.<br/>\u2022  I reconfigured the Mysteries system to be closer to the questions system in Simon Pettersson\u2019s Nerves of Steel. Everyone at the table now participates in generating and crossing off Mystery questions. The players loved this and it helped direct the story tremendously.<br/>\u2022  I scrapped the Quidditch rules (Still working on new ones)<br/>\u2022  I completely rewrote the How to Play section, with a focus on simplifying the language, adding more examples, and describing the game as it\u2019s actually played at a table.<br/>\u2022  I redid the way spells were organized; they\u2019re now broken down by Year and much easier for players to choose.<br/>\u2022  I adjusted the amount of Luck players have, but added more ways to replenish it.<br/>\u2022  I tweaked a number of things about character creation. Backgrounds (now called heritages) give different mixes of starting spells &amp; XP. Houses are picked either by a random roll or by looking at a character\u2019s highest stat.<br/>\u2022  I redid the relationship system. Loyalty (the relationship stat) is now a standard stat, added to rolls involving characters marked as Friends or Rivals.<br/><br/>There are a number of other changes as well, including move names and options, text phrasing, and the layout of the various player &amp; GM sheets. I\u2019d love to get some feedback on the changes, or just your impressions of the game as it currently stands. I\u2019m deeply grateful for everyone who commented previously \u2013 your thoughts &amp; advice have been incredibly helpful in getting the game this far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477228/#Comment_477228" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-26T05:40:30+00:00" title="October 26, 2018  5:40AM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From a Harry Potter fan:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DBB" rel="nofollow">DBB</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I scrapped the Quidditch rules</p></div></blockquote>\nYay!\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DBB" rel="nofollow">DBB</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>(Still working on new ones)</p></div></blockquote>\nIf you must...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477231/#Comment_477231" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-26T07:41:56+00:00" title="October 26, 2018  7:41AM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh, I'll be at Metatopia.

Good question. I\u2019ve run this successfully as both a one-shot and as a multi-session story.<br/><br/>For a one shot, you can start by following the <a href="https://www.hwrpg.net/the-1st-session" rel="nofollow">First Session procedures</a> outlined in the <a href="https://www.hwrpg.net/how-to-play" rel="nofollow">How to Play</a> rules. However, there are a few steps you can leave out or plan in advance:<br/><br/>Everything in <a href="https://www.hwrpg.net/the-1st-session#2-ask-some-questions" rel="nofollow">\u201c2. Ask Some Questions\u201d</a> can be done before you get to the table. You\u2019ll probably want to pre-plan when and where the story begins. Make sure you have an unexpected event planned for the first scene! I also prefer to have everyone in a one-shot be in the same Year &amp; House (let the players decide which House, though).<br/><br/>If you\u2019re *really* pressed for time, you can pre-make characters for the group, but I don\u2019t recommend it. Character creation only takes about 20 minutes and players are always more invested in characters they\u2019ve built themselves. You can shorten the process by skipping step 11, \u201cWho Are Your Friends?\u201d. Have each player list the players to their left &amp; right as Friends instead.<br/><br/>In a one-shot it\u2019s usually not useful to log Mystery questions. Instead, come up with a single Threat before the session. Then, write down a few Mysteries that would lead the characters to confront the Threat. The one-shot is about how the characters investigate the Mysteries and overcome the Threat. Use your Narrator moves and failed rolls to create all the twists and turns that happen along the way.<br/><br/>Hope that helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480644/#Comment_480644" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-20T23:04:59+00:00" title="February 20, 2019 11:04PM">February 20</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow!<br/><br/>I finally got a chance to look through this. <br/><br/>This is - and I don't say this lightly! - a really, truly remarkable piece of work.<br/><br/>The website, the graphic design, the writing, and the game design all look extremely high-quality.<br/><br/>I'm not even really a Harry Potter fan, and I'm still tempted to play this.<br/><br/>Well done!

I think it definitely tweaked my natural GMing instincts in the right way by reminding me to embrace whimsy, which I sometimes struggle with. The thing where everyone said one thing they wanted to see happen, and then we all worked together to make it happen, was A W E S O M E. (The most dramatic and hilarious was, "I want someone to steal the Sorting Hat and put it on a pig." The pig was Sorted into Slytherin.)<br/><br/>We set the game in the 1950's and the plot, such as it was, revolved around people trying to kill / protect Grindelwald's secret son, Lukas, a Durmstrang transfer student. There were 4 PCs, all third years, two Gryffindors and two Hufflepuffs who hung out together.<br/><br/>Getting a full, coherent-ish story including chargen out of ~2.5 hours of play is no mean feat, even with someone running who has a lot of PbtA experience. I'd have trouble doing that with AW, DW, or MH, for example.<br/><br/>The Conditions and House Points were fun and worked well. Friendship / Rivalry as well; Favorite Class didn't come up as much but seems fine. Luck is great.<br/><br/>I'm still dubious of the blow-by-blow nature of the Quidditch rules, but we didn't test them because one of my players vetoed any detailed Quidditch games (even not knowing about the subsystem).<br/><br/>There is one specific thing that bothered us, though: Magic feels too important as a Trait. It's rolled for way too many things. Anyone trying to optimize at all should always just put their +2 into Magic, and if a game has an easy choice like that, it probably means something needs to change.<br/><br/>Our initial suggestion: get rid of it entirely. Make the four different types of magic rolled off of each of the four Traits. Offense = Bravery, Defense / Healing = Loyalty, Charms / Enchantments = Empathy, Potions / Magic Item nonsense = Intellect. Or something.<br/><br/>Backup suggestion: Have six magic stats, separate from the main Traits, one for each of Charm, Healing, Curse, Hex, Defense, and Transfiguration. (Leave Potions as Intellect, and if someone is dumb / evil / deranged enough to use an Unforgiveable Curse, I wouldn't call for a roll, just say what happens and inflict a Consequence, which is sort of what the rules imply anyway?) <br/><br/>Here's the nice thing about six: 4 choose 2 = 6, so you could just make each magic stat the average of two other Traits, thus not requiring any more actual point allocation on the part of the players. So for example Charm = (Empathy + Bravery) / 2.<br/><br/>This change would help a great deal with character differentiation, which the game badly needs. I 100% am on board with no playbooks, but with only one Magic stat, the characters felt a bit samey.<br/><br/>This all might mess with Favorite Class, but the game doesn't really need that mechanic\u2014Favorite (or Most Hated!) Class feels more like Homeroom from Monsterhearts, where it provides a natural starting point for some scenes. There are enough other ways to get +1's, and +1's frankly just aren't that interesting. If you do keep Favorite Class in permanently, I'd actually suggest it granting a bonus die, akin to 5E's Advantage mechanic, rather than another +1.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[PbtA] Hogwarts: An RPG (Updated: Finished Game Released!) - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21787/pbta-hogwarts-an-rpg-updated-finished-game-released/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[PbtA] Hogwarts: An RPG (Updated: Finished Game Released!) - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21787/pbta-hogwarts-an-rpg-updated-finished-game-released/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Thanks all!

The only other thing I would say about that, though, was that it felt very complete, in a way that makes me wonder about campaign play. (I'd consider making Advances every 5 XP rather than every 4, for example, in campaign play.)\n<blockquote>I definitely understand your skepticism regarding the Quidditch rules, but having run them with 5 different groups in the past ~2 weeks, I can confidently say they work.
