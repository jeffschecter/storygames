We all really enjoyed it and want to play again, hopefully switching GM and player roles. So some observations, good bad and indifferent:<br/><br/>One thing we discovered that we didn't like is the option to spend victory points to nerf your opponent's victory points. This is the weakest of sauce and we house-ruled it away. It's a timid mechanical fix for a social problem and it should be ruthlessly purged. If a guy gets five victory points he has <i>earned </i>them, and that's no joke. If he wants to spend them to do something important, using your own points to take his away is unspeakably lame.<br/><br/>The game's color is just killer. There's a ton of stuff that emerges naturally through kiva societies and clans as you play that deepens and broadens the game's setting in a very organic way. You "level up" in your kiva society and you get some kick-ass new trait and artifact, as well as new responsibility. This is a wonderful way to handle advancement - you learn more about the setting as your character grows. <br/><br/>Clinton noted the similarity in the game's resolution system to that of Dogs in the Vineyard, which is apt. Unlike Dogs, spent traits stay spent, while Dogs traits, in HWCTLH terms, are like artifacts. I like the HWCTLH way better, actually, since it pushes you to rely on something other than "I'm lactose intolerant 3d10" over and over. Failings are also really fun, giving your opponent mojo to use against you in exchange for re-using a trait. Very elegant and cool in play.<br/><br/>We struggled a little with getting to the good stuff - the entire game is predicated on a struggle against corruption, but the corruption is where the very coolest bits of the game live. So the players, quite sensibly, fight tooth and nail to avoid the most interesting components in the game, and they have a lot of power. I think this can be ameliorated somewhat through skillful GM play (in our final session we pummeled them pretty good), but it's frustrating to see players avoiding meaty, story-exploding excitement because it means Bad Things for their dudes. I think our finest play happened when Shane, desperate to get some things done, briefly crossed over to the dark side and racked up a ton of corruption. But it seems to reward conservative play to some degree, but I don't know if that is just us failing as GMs to make conflicts meaningful enough to require sacrifices. I'd be interested to hear if this is a local problem or more systemic.<br/><br/>The mythic feel really felt like it gave us room to make big, strong choices. I wasn't hesitant to flood the entire world, to make a mountain scowl and scold people, to suggest that a disease be embodied by a monster. You don't have to go big, but you have that liberty.<br/><br/>Like I said, just some observations. I really love this game and hope people start playing it and talking about it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288430/#Comment_288430" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T05:29:08+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  5:29AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played most of a single cycle* with Simon, Graham, Paula and Brennan at Gen Con. I was the outer GM and Brennan the inner GM. Five seemed like a good number of players although I could see more being added without upsetting the economy too much.<br/><br/>I was on the receiving end of having my victory points nerfed by the players. They were worried what I might get up to. It was a bit disheartening at first but then when they started using sins to get more dice, I wound up with loads of corruption to use instead. This was perhaps a little antagonistic but I get the feeling that that's the GMs' job and it didn't seem to affect the enjoyment of the game.<br/><br/>I really like the trait system. It elegantly gets round the bombing and whoring problems and is more integral to the creation of colour than Dogs.<br/><br/>We had corruption from the very start (as Paula decide she was cheating on her husband) and as Brennan was there to give a metagaming overview it became quickly apparent that sins would have to be committed for players to stay in some of the tougher conflicts. I think that as a GM I mostly lost conflicts to the players but got lots of other resources instead. And the one place where sin quickly enters into the game is in PvP conflicts which can go on for a long time if neither is willing to give. Those really rack up the corruption. So it's a good idea for there to be some antagonism, or at least solid cross-purposes, between the characters from the get go.<br/><br/>I can certainly see us giving this game a lot more play.<br/><br/><br/>*, I was up for more but the other guys wimped out at 1am.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288431/#Comment_288431" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T05:39:53+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  5:39AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I liked spending victory points to nerf the other guy's victory points. It worked for our style of play, which has an adversarial element to it. I <i>knew</i> Steve, as Outer GM, would screw me over, so spending victory points to stop that worked well.<br/><br/>I found the setting/colour a bit problematic, partly because I'm English and don't have a natural handle on the Native American stuff. And I thought the two GMs were a bit of a shame. It took two people away from play.<br/><br/>I quite liked the game. I'd happily play again if Steve wanted to. It was fun.<br/><br/>(I wanted to carry on, but Brennan told me I was tired and needed to go to bed, as though I was a five-year-old child or something.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288432/#Comment_288432" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T05:44:46+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  5:44AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, when I played with Brennan we were committing sins to get dice just to stay afloat, but I didn't see a lot of that in our sessions at home. Joel won against a seven-die GM threat at one point without invoking any corruption - it used up most of his traits, but he did it.<br/><br/>I totally agree that PVP conflicts are the GMs best friend! When I GM again I'll position NPCs to help cause those. The ambitions of our two player characters did not really cross much. I tried to get them married at one point but got smacked down hard in that conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288433/#Comment_288433" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T05:49:33+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  5:49AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2010 5:50AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But Graham, the things he can do to screw you over - five VPs, make you commit <i>any </i>crime, for example - that's just fantastic stuff. I think you can play as hard as you can and, being adults, deal with outcomes that would make you genuinely unhappy (like "I kill your character" or whatever) on the social level. That's my feeling, anyway, but it is a play style issue.<br/><br/>I liked having a co-GM a lot. Our areas of responsibility were sharply delineated, but we could work together and lean on each other for ideas and advice. I think it makes the game a little more adversarial, in a positive way the rules support.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_288437">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288437/#Comment_288437" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T06:37:11+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  6:37AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think the antagonistic GM stance was a problem, I thought it was our duty to push the characters towards sin and corruption. I think at one point I wouldn't give any extra dice because I thought the sin wasn't bad enough, but the player soon fixed that. The game was played in very good humour in case anyone is worried about this point. It's just in some games, like this one, Dogs, MLwM, Steal Away Jordan etc, it's the GM's job to help the player to create problems for their character.<br/><br/>I think I made one one of the PCs pregnant at one point. One VP is all it takes to create an non-rules fact and there are plenty of nice ones to give.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_288439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/288439/#Comment_288439" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-24T06:44:49+00:00" title="August 24, 2010  6:44AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh yeah, when you have one spare VP, as GM it is quite natural to use that to create a complicating fact.

Yeah, taking an opponents points away can be very un-fun. I advise against it in the rules, but I left it in as a safety net. There is an awful lot that can be authored about your character by other players in How We Came to Live Here, and some of the design to give relief valves. If that doesn't work for your group, ditch it pronto.<br/><br/>All of the players have tons of story power, and as I've observed in person, a Hero Player never has to lose a conflict. Because they can sin and gain more dice, they can extend a conflict indefinitely, which the Inside and Outside Players can't do. When two Hero Players are fighting, it's a matter of who blinks first.<br/><br/>I can honestly say, I've never had the problem of players avoiding corruption even after running two dozen games. After a good meaty conflict, they are usually low on resources and resort to crimes. I also turn the screws, hard, as an Inside or Outside Player, and try to get the Hero Players in conflict with each other. Framing scenes that play on a character's weakness is also a trick I use a lot. Lots of social skills? Time for a natural disaster. Great fighter? Defend against your mom setting you up with a girl you don't like! I'm very aggressive and that's definitely a good way to go toward the corruption part of the game.<br/><br/>You also found the other little secret: "Narrate a change that has no game rule impact" is huge. Marriage, children, all sorts of things aren't marked on your sheet. Go to town!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
