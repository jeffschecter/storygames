I wanted fantasy games: D&amp;D, Runequest, Palladium... but few seemed to be playing them.<br/><br/>Fifteen years on, and I'd really like to try some. Particularly Vampire. I really like the idea of a developed modern-day setting with the PCs as neonate vampires trying to survive and gain power in a hostile environment. I haven't run a modern-world game in... at least a decade, and I'm very excited about this.<br/><br/>Now, I've got no interest in the highly-plotted illusionist style that Vampire is notorious for. I'm all about PC-centric narrativist play - hitting the PCs with bangs to see what they do (so Story Now and Play to See What Happens).<br/><br/>I'm leaning towards using the nWoD rules (Reqiuem rather than Masquerade), but with some storygame hybridisation. Crucially, I want explicit flags and keys - Burning Wheel's beliefs are my current favourite for this. <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3278/bringing-story-games-elements-to-vampire-the-requiem/p1" rel="nofollow">A previous SG thread </a> discusses the use of TSoY-style keys in NWod, which in turn links to <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=23438.0" rel="nofollow">a Forge thread</a>  which extends the chain to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wmerrifield/VampireHouserules.pdf?attredirects=0" rel="nofollow">this lovely PDF of house rules incorporating TSoY keys among several other things</a>. (they're written for oWoD, but I don't think that's a fundamental problem)<br/><br/>I should note that I've never owned any WoD rules, so my knowledge of them is hazy. I may buy the nWod core book today.<br/><br/>Does anyone have any advice on running Vampire in this style?<br/><br/><br/>Rob                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/michael.harrel" title="michael.harrel"><img alt="michael.harrel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/michael.harrel">michael.harrel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389612/#Comment_389612" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-08T04:56:12+00:00" title="September  8, 2012  4:56AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2012 4:56AM by michael.harrel.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a few IAWA-esque oracles for most of the nWoD games.  They're over on <a href="http://infinitemachine.wordpress.com/tag/oracles/" rel="nofollow">my blog</a>.<br/><br/>If you're using the nWoD rules, I'd highly recommend some of the tweaks in the Mirrors supplement.  That can streamline the rules a bunch. <br/><br/>When I use the oracles above, my character gen looks like this:<br/><br/>1. Assign Attributes: In my game, these are "Mental", "Physical", and "Social."  (Split 9 points between them)<br/>2. Assign Dispositions: These are "Power", "Finesse" and "Resistance." (Split 7 points between them)<br/>3. Create Specialties: Basically, write down five things that your character is good at. (This is kind of like Skills mixed with Merits, only they can be anything.  Using them adds a die to your pool.)<br/>4. Create Powers: If your character is supernatural, you may create up to three special Powers for them. When used, you receive an extra die for your roll, and the roll is 9-again.  A power may also increase an  attribute or disposition (so super strength may add a die to Physical, say).<br/>5. Calculate Advantages: (Health=Physical+Resistance+3; Willpower=Mental+Resistance; Speed=Physical+Power+5)<br/>6. Determine Equipment:  List the important or interesting things your character carries around.  A normal item grants +1 die, a big or good item grants +2 die, a crap item gives you a -1 die penalty.<br/><br/>Then all that's left is to create the Best Interests and the NPCs.  I've been playing around with using a GMless system, but haven't had time to actually test it out yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389613/#Comment_389613" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-08T05:37:14+00:00" title="September  8, 2012  5:37AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Vampire Revised Quickstart is downloadable for free and contains a lighter version of the rules, with Disciplines that I much prefer to the ones in the full game.

It's one of those things that easily drifts into lazy play and lets the game escape the orbit of "personal horror" into sewercrawling with trenchcoats and katanas (which is fun and all, but probably not the reason why someone would go to vampire in the first place).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Praion" title="Praion"><img alt="Praion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Praion">Praion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389616/#Comment_389616" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-08T06:05:46+00:00" title="September  8, 2012  6:05AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>The second thing to do, if you're using the Masquerade, apply more pressure to the Nature/Discipline/Humanity/Blood cycles and enforce their rules more strictly.</blockquote>\nCan you elaborate on this?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389622/#Comment_389622" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-08T08:34:57+00:00" title="September  8, 2012  8:34AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2012 8:35AM by Teataine.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Can you elaborate on this?<br/></blockquote>\nSure. I haven't run or played Storyteller in a while, so I can't be very specific. This is Masquerade we're talking about, I'm not familiar with Requiem.<br/><br/>Willpower is actually a pretty powerful thing, but in my experience (YMMV) the rules for gaining and spending Willpower are often glossed over and ignored in play. Willpower can be regained by acting in accordance to one's Nature (if I remember correctly). This creates a nice roleplaying incentive and Belief/Key style reward system that doesn't get enough use imo (again, YMMV).<br/><br/>Blood is also a very powerful resource, used to power Disciplines, boost physical stats, appear more human (blushing your cheeks) etc. etc. If the characters gain blood easily or if feeding is glossed over then it's just whatever. You still do all the cool shit vampires do, but it's just superpowers. Instead if feeding is something that has more focus, becoming something risky that forces the vampire into crime and (accidental or intentional) murder it stresses the "you're a monster" part of the game where if you want to do cool magical vampire shit, you need to <i>drink someone's blood</i>. Which in turn will elicit Humanity loss tests.<br/><br/>Those are the mechanics that actually work in favor of creating stories with the characters and address the "personal horror" idea where you're struggling with maintaining your sanity and humanity while acting the way vampires act. So I feel that if you want story, those are the mechanics you should be paying attention to and engaging in play, as opposed to having your vampire roll Dex+Drive because it rained tonight if you know what I mean.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389624/#Comment_389624" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-08T09:43:54+00:00" title="September  8, 2012  9:43AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Teataine">@Teataine</a><br/><br/>I really struggled with the the Blood/Feeding cycle both as a player and ST. As a group we knew it was a cool mechanic but trying to execute it at the table was boring. Feeding just reminded us for sitting around watching the Decking in Shadowrun hack into a system. But worse since there were 3-4 players so it was like having 3-4 Deckers each hacking away. <br/><br/>I am sure there is a better way to handle this but could never figure it out.

Make opportunities to gain power that they'll have to fight for, possibly risk their lives for.<br/><br/>If I were running nVampire... I'd look through the clans, look through the covenants, and make one NPC for each that embodies whatever I find interesting about the group, with a few extra quirks that would make them fun to play. Naturally, there would be more vampires than this in the city, but if I ever thought "Hmm, I need a Carthian NPC", I'd use my default Carthian guy unless I had a solid reason not to, like he'd already been established as against what I think the Carthians would be arguing for or whatnot.<br/><br/>Now, take these ten vampires, put them each on an index card with some public knowledge, like "creepy witch vampire who lives in the suburbs", "politically ambitious Carthian", or "Nosferatu. NOT TO BE FUCKED WITH" or such, and then throw them on the table after character creation, and ask some loaded questions that establish bonds. Like "Okay, which of these owes you a favor, and what for? Which of them do you owe a favor to? Which of them did you see doing something they weren't supposed to? Do they know you know? Hey, you're an oldish vampire, did you turn her? No? Not even in a moment of weakness after your hunger pushed you too far, and nobody knows?" Then you've got a bunch of NPCs you're excited about playing with existing connections to the PCs, and let me tell you that's a great tool.<br/><br/>And if the players give you some hooks in their character creation, pull those suckers, hard. Nothing makes a player light up like reincorporating some of their character's backstory. Don't make it a sideline to your main sitch, make it the main sitch in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389626/#Comment_389626" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-08T10:37:23+00:00" title="September  8, 2012 10:37AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It became a game largely of supers with eyeliner. *yawn*</blockquote>\nYep, that's what the game becomes when you ignore those subsystems in my experience, too.<br/><br/>The question then becomes how do you make those subsystems fun or at least achieve that same effect in a different way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389627">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389627/#Comment_389627" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-08T11:00:11+00:00" title="September  8, 2012 11:00AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Supers with eyeliner is only not fun if you didn't read 70s-80s horror comics.<br/><br/>Anyway, flags are easy, they're called skills and Disciplines.<br/><br/>Keys should be straightforward too, just have a care. WW games have a very flat XP curve (you get your XP essentially from showing up and playing the game) so that might lead to some issues. There's no XP-related exit point like Transcendence, so someone who doesn't pick or write good Keys well might get grumpy as their cohorts zoom past them into total Satanic power. There will be no catching up, no way to slow down the other people, no place where the guy who hits 1,000 Keys will exit the game.<br/><br/>With a group of 3 or more players we did one hunt per session roleplayed out. Everyone else used the abstract hunting rules. We picked who would have next session's hunt before we left for the night.  Sometimes there would be two hunts or even one for everyone, if there was Enemy Action. This unusual situation became memorable then.<br/><br/>The vise is Humanity. In a bad situation, using your Vampire powers, drinking a shit ton of blood, and controlling people's minds and murdering them is the best way to solve problems (you should make this the best way to solve problems).  However, this will tear your Humanity to pieces. This is the main vise of the game, and it already exists.<br/><br/>I really think you should get and read the rules before you start worrying about how much brain damage they will cause you.  Really, virtually everything you need is already in there. Including PC-centrism.

I'm all about PC-centric narrativist play - hitting the PCs with bangs to see what they do (so Story Now and Play to See What Happens).</blockquote>\nNothing about <i>Vampire</i> inherently gets in the way of what you're after. (Edit: Yet, yes, there's lots of room for additional play that strengthens and rewards what you're after in a way that <i>Vampire</i> often doesn't without drift or hack.) That notoriety is something I fought against, in print and in play, for a long time. But if you treat the burgeoning, unfolding schemes and machinations of dreaded elder vampires and conniving, cutthroat upstarts as things that unfold only if the PCs do not interfere, then you have a world of active and <i>inter</i>active game objects that are vulnerable to attack and influence. That is you have character-designed plots and counter-plots and not metagame imposed <i>narrative</i> plot. (Plot is a thorny, misshapen word for these discussions anyway because it gets in the way of discussing a character's arc and a character's schemes.)<br/><br/>Try as I might to avoid using this terminology, think of NPC schemes as AW's countdown clocks, each positioned on a front somewhere, and you've got the nest of blood-addicted vipers that a good <i>Vampire</i> city should resemble.<br/><br/>It's not about marching through some kind of tightly plotted thing, it's about the fact that PCs probably can't take on every vampire in the city and outrun the consequences for doing so. Whatever they confront or collide with, other vampires shouldn't wait for them to finish that story and catch up. Schemes should unfold while the players' characters are enacting their own plans. This plays directly into the unstoppable march of time that is part of the malignant grandeur of the game.<br/><br/>I still think <i>Requiem Chronicler's Guide</i> and <i>Damnation City</i> are pretty okay books and might help you fuel some of what you're after. <br/><br/>Here's a bunch of <a href="http://wordstudio.net/thegist/?p=2115" rel="nofollow"><i>Vampire</i> story ideas</a>, which is easily the most popular page on my site. You'll find a lot of these are situation-first, play-to-find-out ideas, which I think I must've first written in 2008 or something.<br/><br/>But, yes, a lot of the tone is in the hands of the players (including the GM) to maintain, is affected by subject matter as much or more than mechanics, and can drift away from the sticky-with-blood treachery and dread atmosphere you might be after. Keeping the bloodsucking in the text, and not in the background or the subtext, helps. <i>Vampire</i> is at its most bleak and human when you make humans appear on stage as often as possible, in my experience, and when that purpose is to dramatize one of the core recurring bits\u2014the getting of blood\u2014it helps draw a circle around what your chronicle really is about.<br/><br/>It's been a while since I wrote about <i>Vampire</i>. This is not a habit I want to get back into. Fruitful topic, though.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389637/#Comment_389637" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-08T13:30:26+00:00" title="September  8, 2012  1:30PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1 Will and JDC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389640/#Comment_389640" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-08T15:19:00+00:00" title="September  8, 2012  3:19PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2012 3:28PM by akooser.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a>  Awseome!

My group had a great time with it. We pretty much played Vampire for two years straight over Skype.<br/><br/>If you're interested other Vampire hacks, I'm working on a AW-Vampire hack called Undying. I play tested it at GenCon very successfully and am wrapping up some revisions now. I'll be play testing it with John Harper and my gaming group in a little over a week. I'll get it posted on my blog soon. You can check out what I've written about it already, if you want, <a href="http://enigmamachinations.wordpress.com/2012/08/13/undying-revamped/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>Basically, the mechanics of the game are Humanity/Will, which is your connection to people vs. connection to vampires - as one goes up the other goes down; Status, a measure of where you stand among vampires: Blood, that one is pretty much the same; and Debt, a combination of barter and strings. The goal of Undying is to shape play around the human-vampire self struggle and the struggle against other vampires. To do this, your Humanity/Will and Status are modified by the moves you make - so, for example, if you do things like leaving bloodless corpses behind after hunting, that's a move and that move changes your Humanity/Will stat, making you more of a monster and less of a human. In Undying, all of your stats are adjusted by a feedback loop designed into the system. There is no XP. You advance your character mechanically my advancing them in the fiction and vice versa.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389663/#Comment_389663" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-08T22:42:58+00:00" title="September  8, 2012 10:42PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the problem I had wasn't with the rules as with most of the written scenarios that had The One Way the story had to go, No Matter What. Now, this wasn't universally true -- I nigh fainted in shock when I realized Midnight Circus left everything in the hands of the PCs, really, no fooling. But, there was one Vampire scenario where the GM is told at least twice, maybe three times, "It isn't a good idea to have the PCs be captured No Matter What. But, sometimes, it's absolutely essential, like right here." And there were far too many cases of "And the NPCs discover the PCs' havens, no matter what -- no matter how much the players invested points in them or what precautions were taken. Oh, and the PCs can't spot their tail, and even if they do, the tail gets away No Matter What."<br/><br/>While I'd likely use different rules today (OTE, Fate, and DitV are just the first possibilities that come to mind, and Polaris is jumping up and down pointing out how wonderfully it could handle this sort of thing), the actual mechanics worked well enough. Indeed, when I read games that tried to be more complex, I got a real appreciation for just how well the base WoD mechanics did work.<br/><br/>Then again, I ran Vampire: The Masquerade and Changeling: The Dreaming each all of once, so if there were bumps in the rules, I probably just missed them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soviet" title="soviet"><img alt="soviet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/715/nBVUFTQIKLVIT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soviet">soviet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389666/#Comment_389666" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-09T03:20:54+00:00" title="September  9, 2012  3:20AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2012 3:21AM by soviet.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few years ago I posted up a Vampire to HeroQuest conversion which turned out pretty well (although now I would use Other Worlds).

Characters with Wrath should be confronted with things that make them angry, or at least opportunities to vent their building anger. Also, Clan and Covenant choices are great. <br/><br/>If you're like me and you like some built-in nastiness on your skill checks, it's very easy to port concepts from Apocalypse World over and lay them right on top of skill checks. Players go about their business, you call for rolls constantly. Failure means bad things happen, success means the player is given a choice or stuck with a consequence, exceptional success means they get everything they wanted. <br/><br/>Humanity is a huuuuuge deal. Call for Humanity rolls all of the time. I took a lot of cues from Sorcerer when I was doing Humanity stuff in Vampire. I also took out the rules on spending XP to increase Humanity and instead offered players scenes in which they tried to act like a human being and got a Humanity roll to increase their Humanity. <br/><br/>Vampire loses some of its shine when you take the humans out of it. So I also asked each of the players to come up with at least two humans that they had a relationship with. I would bring these guys in all the time. They became safe ports in the storm of the game, and they became targets. In both ways, they highlighted the humanity of the vampire characters and really underlined what they were going through. <br/><br/>One thing I heard Eddy Webb mention in an interview: his greatest inspiration for running Vampire is the tv series The Wire. I think hearing that really helped me solidify my thoughts on the game. Vampire is about communities and bureaucracies, and how they both mess you up. Will brings up Damnation City, which is a freaking fantastic sourcebook all about designing your city and creating all kinds of hooks for the players to engage with. Work with your players to create a city that they can be a part of, or at least topple over.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389689/#Comment_389689" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-09T12:22:09+00:00" title="September  9, 2012 12:22PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2012 12:35PM by Rob_Alexander.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks all - in 36 hours you've swamped me completely!

What I mean by that is, for example:\n<blockquote>Eliminate the threat safely (Key of Renown): You end a threat to your Sept or the Garou without any serious harm coming to any Garou, and the tale is told. Gain 5 Wisdom.</blockquote>\nwhich is just another way of phrasing a rule already in the book, I believe, but also:\n<blockquote>Key of the Advisor (Philodox):<br/>Minor: You give advice to someone which they follow (1 XP)<br/>Major: You give advice to someone important (e.g. an elder of your Sept) on an important issue, which they then follow (2 XP, 1 WP)<br/>Rejection: You give purposefully bad advice to someone OR someone acts on your advice and the pack or Sept suffer failure or harm because of it (4 XP, rewrite Key)<br/></blockquote>\nWhat this has done for the game is tremendous - all the Keys are available on the one sheet which is possibly the most used play artifact in the game. Play largely revolves around playing towards hitting those keys, which means we're actually both creating personal story arcs and engaging with the setting on a level I never remember doing when we played it straight.<br/>I'd suggest doing something similar for the "Nature/Discipline/Humanity/Blood cycle" if you can figure out how.<br/><br/>I've also run oWoD V:tM using Primetime Adventures before and it worked handsomely. People picked their clans and based on that we knew what their weakness and disciplines were - aside from that, we just used the narrative control conflict resolution system and leaned heavily on characters' Issues in order to conjure the correct themes for the game (rather than spending time rolling Dex + Drive after a rain storm, etc etc).<br/><br/>ETA: The XP award system in (at least 2nd Ed) WoD games suck, because they're based largely on GM subjective judgment. Gaining XP in WoD games becomes an exercise in pleasing the GM, and in my experience the tradition has been that if you're obviously focusing on gaining XP, you're a "power gamer" who should get less than the others. The system of Keys make it more clear-cut when someone should get XP for playing to type or advancing the plot, and actually rewards players for doing so rather than punish them for being XP-greedy badwrongfun players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390011/#Comment_390011" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-13T07:25:50+00:00" title="September 13, 2012  7:25AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not really pleasing the GM that much.
