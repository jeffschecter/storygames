He wants to have a bigger presence of small press/indie rpgs/story games/etc.  That's a reasonable goal, in my mind, and so I'd like to support that plan.<br/><br/>Now, I've never attended this con before nor even a GASP meeting.  But the con is right here in Pittsburgh, so the worst that happens is I waste a weekend and am out some admission fees if the con sucks.  But it means I don't know what to expect of the con atmosphere or anything... looking at the GASP website, it seems like there is a lot of very traditional roleplaying happening at GASP, with Jason and maybe some others promoting the sort of weird indie games I'd be running.  (GASP and the con do not appear to be terribly LARP-friendly, or I might run one.)  I can't tell from reading the website if I still get my con attendance refunded if no players show up for a game I plan to run.  I need to run at least two four hour sessions to get a GM refund.<br/><br/><br/>On the other end of the equation, I have played a fair number of "story games" (or whatever the cool kids are calling them these days) but not a huge number.  And I've GMed even fewer.  Ideally, I'd want something easy to GM.<br/><br/>Mainly, I'm being indecisive and trying to gauge what people would actually be interested in seeing.  Yeah, I know, you're unlikely to be at the con, but I really just want someone else's input to help make a decision.<br/><br/><br/><b>Games I'd Consider Running:<br/><br/>Games I've Read But Not Played or Run:</b><br/><br/><a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/index.php?game=roach" rel="nofollow">The Shab-Al Hiri Roach</a><br/><a href="http://www.evilhat.com/home/dryh/" rel="nofollow">Don't Rest Your Head</a> (Apparently someone else is running this already.)<br/><a href="http://johntynes.com/revland2000/rl_puppetland.html" rel="nofollow">Puppetland</a><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Games I have Played but not GMed:</b><br/><br/><a href="http://www.lumpley.com/dogsources.html" rel="nofollow">Dogs in the Vineyard</a><br/><a href="http://www.memento-mori.com/lacuna/" rel="nofollow">Lacuna Part One: The Creation of the Mystery and the Girl from Blue City</a><br/><a href="http://swingpad.com/dustyboots/wordpress/" rel="nofollow">Polaris</a>  GMless, which means it's easier to run, though still hard to explain.<br/><a href="http://www.magnumopuspress.com/?page_id=8" rel="nofollow">The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron munchausen</a>   Also GMless, and easier to explain to boot.<br/><br/><br/><b>Games I have Actually Successfully GMed:</b><br/><br/><a href="http://www.gregstolze.com/downloads.html" rel="nofollow">Executive Decision</a>  Has the advantages of having been run before, having been successful and having been easy to GM.

There are a ton of interesting games out there to run; this was mainly sticking to the ones I have on hand and have read thoroughly enough to consider them as options.  I am currently leaning toward Executive Decision and one or two other games.  What other games?  Is there some compelling reason not to run Executive Decision?

If I were still in Pittsburgh, I would fight ten men to sign up for your game.<br/><br/>I remember a time when I was watching <i>Brotherhood of the Wolf</i>.  There is a scene at the beginning where the Chevalier is introducing his Indian companion to his French peers, and he talks about how they fought together "at the Battle of Three Rivers." A cheer went up in the theater (the one on Murray, near the top of the Squirrel Hill commercial strip). Pittsburghers love Pittsburgh.

I spent a lot of time playing pick-up Traveller with my brother, and we roped in some guys to play with us, which was fun. I also ran <i>Ganakagok</i>, and played some <i>In A Wicked Age</i>. Jason ran a few playtests of his <i>The Fifth World</i> and had good attendance; my brother and I actually bailed before it started because the table was too crowded. So you might get some interest in your games. The GASPers seem to be a pretty trad-heavy group, so there's not a lot of familiarity with indie games, as far as I could tell last year. So you might get some mileage out of running a "Game Chef Award Winning!" game.<br/><br/>I've used <i>Executive Decision</i> in the classroom and my students think it's fun; for me it's work. But it practically runs itself; I break my class up into separate groups, each playing a cabinet facing the same situation (in a parallel universe, I guess), and make one student in each group be the President.<br/><br/>I'd like to see <i>Shab-al-Hiri Roach</i> or <i>Polaris</i> on the schedule; that would be cool, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222593/#Comment_222593" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T21:18:58+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  9:18PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ccreitz</cite> the theater (the one on Murray, near the top of the Squirrel Hill commercial strip).</blockquote>\nMy bus takes me past that theatre every day.\n<blockquote> Pittsburghers love Pittsburgh.

But my brother's going to run an In a Wicked Age anthology (three chapters, one each day of the con), reprising the "Three Rivers Oracle" I wrote up last year. I need to do some tweaking, but it gives you a sword &amp; sorcery tone in Pittsburgh 1,000 years ago, with the last giants of the Allegwi dying out, mounds binding their ancient magic, and everywhere Cahokia trying to infiltrate and expand its influence. I don't think both would be too much local flavor, but if you don't want to do Bloody Forks, you don't have to worry about local interests being under-represented.<br/><br/>I also agree with Bill, I'd love to see "Game Chef Award Winning!" printed up in the schedule.<br/><br/>GASP is generally pretty traditional, but we've got some "indie-curious," and folks willing to try new things. I also hope to line up enough people at this year's GASPcon to attract an indie crowd. So, if you live within driving distance of Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, certain parts of New York or Kentucky), keep it in mind!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223392/#Comment_223392" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-08T06:26:10+00:00" title="August  8, 2009  6:26AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bloody Forks is looking to be very likely.

This wasn't a big surprise: early on in the registration process Bloody Forks filled up but Department Nine and Executive Decision didn't.  One guy signed up to play Executive Decision, but you need a few more people to play the cabinet, you know?  He was interested in it as a tool for teaching history, so I sent him to the game's website to download, and later he played in my not-terribly-historically-accurate Bloody Forks game.<br/><br/><a href="http://mrteapot.livejournal.com/80540.html" rel="nofollow">Full report on the Bloody Forks game is available</a>, if you want to know how it went.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
