Back in the day, metagaming was the Great Satan of player flaws. I've realized lately though, that this is only true when you're using metagaming to be a douche. Once I got away from the standard GM-Player relationship, suddenly metagaming wasn't so scary. In some (many) story games, it's downright necessary!<br/><br/>How do you all feel about using player knowledge to advance the plot nowadays? If you went through a similar change I did, what games caused the paradigm shift?<br/><br/>For me, it was Burning Wheel/Empires and Dogs in the Vineyard. Especially Dogs. This little nugget is what made my brain go "pop":\n<blockquote>...Or sometimes, the NPC wants to lie, instead. That\u2019s okay! I have the NPC lie. You\u2019ve watched movies. You always can tell when you\u2019re watching a movie who\u2019s lying and who\u2019s telling the truth. And wouldn\u2019t you know it, most the time the players are looking at me with skeptical looks, and I give them a little sly nod that yep, she\u2019s lying. And they get these great, mean, tooth-showing grins \u2014 because when someone lies to them, ho boy does it not work out.</blockquote>\nWait, you mean i can fully let the players in on what's going on?! They don't even have to role for it?!<br/><br/>I think fear of metagaming comes from the traditional fear that players are wild, wooly beasts that must be carefully maintained or they'll run roughshod over everyone else's fun. What really boggles me about this mentality is that it holds true at many tables <i>even when the players involved are also GM's in other games.</i> In many cases, it's not true, but try convincing some traditional players that. Knights of the Dinner table and The Gamers 1 &amp; 2 are about exactly this.<br/><br/>Since many storygames designs are built around collaborative story building, the term "metagaming" doesn't really seem appropriate. So what do we call it in situations where it's a good thing, and not just some jackass trying to justify a absurd action in game?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will%20Grzanich" title="Will Grzanich"><img alt="Will Grzanich" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will%20Grzanich">Will Grzanich</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182614/#Comment_182614" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T11:53:47+00:00" title="December 10, 2008 11:53AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Author/Director stance?  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser" title="kevin.weiser"><img alt="kevin.weiser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.finitesite.com/spiderlegs/wlkngI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser">kevin.weiser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182615/#Comment_182615" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T11:59:00+00:00" title="December 10, 2008 11:59AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Will Grzanich</cite>Author/Director stance?  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nWell, that really does nail it on the head, doesn't it? In many old-school tables, that is soley the purview of the GM. Players are *not* allowed to take that stance. They're only allowed Actor stance.

Yes, there are gamers out there who are just socially broken human beings.  You couldn't take them bowling.  A group must be unified and *trust* that they are unified on this point:<br><br>We are playing *this* game for *this* purpose.<br/><br/>And that applies from Vampire on down the line to A Flower for Mara.  A GM can only play "traffic cop" between multiple assumptions about the purpose of play for so long.  And I'm not even talking about Creative Agenda at this point.  I'm talking about something much, much more basic. <br/><br/>I think if you have that basic unity the whole "meta game" thing virtually vanishes because no one will notice.  When a game is humming along people experience what they later describe as "immersion" and no one bats an eye at "meta game" techniques because they simply stop being aware of them.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182626">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182626/#Comment_182626" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T12:45:15+00:00" title="December 10, 2008 12:45PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;  What is Metagaming to you?<br/><br/>It's an artifact of an obsolete system.<br/><br/>Consider back in the day, when an RPG was played at a convention, with strangers, competitively, with scoring and with prizes.<br/><br/>Within that context, I think a prohibition against metagaming makes a fair amount of sense.<br/><br/>Taken outside of that context, it offers only a limited value.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_182634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182634/#Comment_182634" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T13:00:35+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  1:00PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of those little plastic dinguses you'd have to put inside the too-large hole of a record single.<br/><br/>This:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://flag.blackened.net/ati/imagenes/record.gif"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser" title="kevin.weiser"><img alt="kevin.weiser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.finitesite.com/spiderlegs/wlkngI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevin.weiser">kevin.weiser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182636/#Comment_182636" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T13:05:21+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  1:05PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So where does that disconnect come from?

So there's something more going on here.<br/><br/>That doesn't surprise me, actually. Trad GMing <b>can</b> involve a lot of work. If you've done a bunch of prep (something many folks feel is absolutely a requirement for GMing), the last thing you want is character players fucking it up. If they metagame, it's like they showed up to a Martha Stewart level of involvement dinner party, and brought their own take-out pizza.<br/><br/>On the flip side, as players, traddy GMs are often "on vacation", and expect the sort of experiebnce that they put together for their own players. To carry on with a bad comparison, it would be like throwing multiple chi-chi dinner parties, and showing up at your pals house for an invite, only to discover that they want you there to help cook <i>everything</i> ( not just politely lend a hand here and there).<br/><br/>Indie games with "metagamey" rules are more like potlucks.\n<blockquote>Do you think this is more about GM's not wanting to give up their absolute authority or is it players fearing additional responsibility? </blockquote>\nIt's about knowing what you like, because you like what you know.<br/><br/>I mean, it took my friends, like, ten years of coaxing to get me to try sushi.<br/><br/>Love the stuff now, but man did I fight that one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182686/#Comment_182686" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T14:46:36+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  2:46PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think its anything as malicious as all that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts habit.

Dogs, Shadow of Yesterday and Primetime Adventures taught me about conflict resolution and intent vs. action. Lots of one-shots and campaigns-gone-horribly-off-track-but-still-fun showed me how "player vs. player" can be much more fun than "players vs. the GMs plot". GM-less scenarios/games showed me that roleplaying can be great without having a GM as a safety net.

I don't feel this is a matter of opinion or play style. If you are disrupting the fiction, or you are gaining an unfair advantage, it is bad. <br>\n<br>\nMind you, I don't think the term itself is a good descriptive one, but that's semantics. <br>\n<br>\nWhat other people consider metagaming isn't the same thing. In my (very traditional) FFRP group, using player-knowledge to influence character decisions in a way that makes sense in the fiction and enhances drama is a time-honored technique. <br/>\n<br/>\nExample of the bad definition of metagaming: I as the player saw your character steal my character's gold. My character failed their perception check. Suddenly my character grabs their pouch, realizing the pouch is lighter, and turns and attacks your character. <br/>\n<br/>\nExample of the bad definition of metagaming: I as the player have the Monster Manual. My character has never seen a skeleton. When we find ourselves facing skeletons, I immediately switch to my mace, even though I always use my sword. Everyone else has agreed that their characters wouldn't know that skeletons have DR against bladed weapons, so they stick to their primary (bladed) weapons in the attack. This gives me an unfair advantage. (Note that this isn't unfair if everyone is fine with switching to blunt weapons against skeletons, and as such isn't normally considered bad metagaming... Everyone I knew in DDO carried a mace for undead, or a cheapo weapon if we were expecting acidic slimes)<br/>\n<br/>\nExample of "good" metagaming. My character doesn't know that yours killed his father. I make the decision that, in conversation, my character brings up how much he admired his father, and wants to be like him. This lends a sense of the ironic that he's discussing his father with the man who murdered him, and added context for later, when/if my character ever finds out. "I trusted you! You killed my father, and you stood there nodding sympathetically while I poured my heart out about how much I missed him!"                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_182750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/182750/#Comment_182750" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-10T21:18:47+00:00" title="December 10, 2008  9:18PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 11, 2008 10:03AM by Valamir.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>People go with what they're taught.</blockquote>\nA bit like when newbs reflexively bang their heads against the "No meta-gaming" concept?

Like "this game is broken" or "I like immersion".</blockquote>\nHalf of me wants to agree with this assertion and its finality. "What's a Huffalump?" "You'll know it when you see it."<br/><br/>However, I think metagaming IS a usable term, but only if defined more broadly than how Kevin began this thread. I'd go with something like this:<br/>Metagaming - The use of knowledge in a game about character portrayal to which the character would not or could not have access but which the player knows.<br/><br/>First thing I think of as an example of metagaming I've seen a lot is the way people become trigger happy on the ending afternoon of a LARP in which resources reset. All weekend, folks have carefully managed their ability use--never know what's gonna jump out of the bushes next, so don't waste any "shots"--but then this magic "Sunday" comes along and, WHAM! Goblins with 2 HP being blasted by 30 HP damage spells or one-use-per-day Slay abilities. Showing off, in a sense.<br/><br/>Now, "in the fiction," every one of these folks, theoretically, is at as much risk Sunday night as Friday night, but the players all know that an NPC monster isn't going to pop out of the convenience store at which they are going to stop for gas, so fuck it. Fire away.<br/><br/>Similarly, playing a game like Call of Cthulhu, with a "neophyte" style character, and then acting in a far more deliberate and Mythos-aware manner than any newbie stumbling upon such things would (except the worst sort of paranoid). Playing any sort of "surprise horror" game as if your character has seen the horror movies that you have--"Ah, tell ya what, Bob, how about YOU take up the rear and I'll forage ahead?"<br/><br/>When is metagaming "bad"? Well, being a dick is a start--spoiling others' fun or breaking others' suspension of disbelief--in a sense, reminding folks that they are playing "just" a game. Like those fuckers that shout out "The monster's right behind you!" in the movies, basically. When is it good? When it's unobtrusive or does not in fact seem like something your character wouldn't know or do, and everyone's happily humming along together.<br/><br/>I think what a lot of folks in this thread are talking about is not metagaming. For instance, any game in which the mechanics require address of premise ("story")--Universalis is the uber example, here. You can't even START to play Universalis without addressing at least some elements out of character, out of a role, purely Authorial. There's not even any characters yet! Similarly with Burning Empires, IAWA, and other "setting builder" games. I am sure it's the same with any game with scene stages, though examples fail me at the moment--as players, you HAVE to speak using knowledge that your character or related characters wouldn't know, to keep scene framing on track.<br/><br/>None of that stuff is really "meta"--it's part and parcel of playing the rules as written. It's normative to proper play.<br/><br/>But knowing that you're about to be totally safe from harm and so, why not, firing off all your resources in a splurge of show-off? Not normative, not part of the spirit of the rules as written. Meta.

And Luke says that he really likes forks (which let you add in a related ability to a roll), but that he stripped them from more recent incarnations of the Burning Wheel system (like MG) because players tended to abuse them, going down their abilities like it was a shopping list, asking if they could fork them in.  And I was like, huh.  Fork abuse seems related to metagaming because it comes from an adversarial relationship between the player and the GM taken to an extreme, such that people have to worry about the other side "cheating" by trying to gain an unfair advantage.  I totally know players who enjoy competition taken to that level, but, to me, that kind of play environment is poisonous to my brand of fun and I'd go play something else with other people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
