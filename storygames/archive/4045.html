We envision running indie story games in three or four game slots across two sessions, morning and afternoon, with a dedicated "demo" track with 20-30 minute demos running in it and an hour break for lunch to take advantage of the nearby restaurants on College Ave. Our plan is to publicize it on campus to try to draw in some latent as well as manifest gaming constituencies on campus. But we also hope to attract "immersed" story-gamers who might be willing to take a day trip to beautiful Happy Valley for a day o' gaming goodness. So my question is, what game would we have to run to get you here? That is, is there anything that if you knew it would be available to play, you'd block out the day and drive however many hours it would take to get you to central Pennsylvania? Alternately, what would you want to run?<br/><br/>Let me know.<br/><br/>[cross-posted on the Forge]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90483/#Comment_90483" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-26T06:44:20+00:00" title="August 26, 2007  6:44AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's an eight hour drive for me, so it'd probably have to be more than two games worth of goodness - like a weekend of guaranteed fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90484/#Comment_90484" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-26T06:47:10+00:00" title="August 26, 2007  6:47AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gotcha.
