It seemed time to revisit, so Joshua, Judson and I have played it twice. Before commenting on system stuff and the sessions, here\xe2\u20ac\u2122s the actual record of play we wrote during the most recent game:<br/><br/>Ithaca<br/><br/>Faithful Penelope / pleads with / Odysseus, Penelope\xe2\u20ac\u2122s husband / to not disappear / like sea foam<br/>Like the mighty lion / Odysseus, Circe\xe2\u20ac\u2122s bane / reminds / Penelope / to be / hell to suitors<br/>Penelope, aged and bitter at her lost youth / cries / tears / like a stream cascading down to dash upon jagged rocks<br/>Abner who found courage in cups / laughs at / Penelope aged and bitter at her lost youth<br/><br/>And Penelope, seeing her husband sail forth to the west, throws her wedding band into the waves<br/><br/>Barbary Coast<br/><br/>Hungry and lacking for women, the pirates / descend / like ravenous hawks / on defenseless prey <br/>Kallismus, bearer of dark and dismal tidings / swears the pirates / will be dragged to the bottom of the sea / by the nymphs that guard the ocean deep <br/><br/>And yet the pirates laugh and wrest Kallismus away as a slave<br/><br/>Mediterranean Sargossa <br/><br/>Sailing / the Sargossa Sea / the spirit of Ithaca / is becalmed / and blood-marked Odysseus / despairs<br/>Odysseus, drawn by relentless destiny / cries like a mother who has lost her youngest child / rages like a demon / and drives his men on like a slave master<br/>Like a swarm of bees disturbed from their nest / man eating crabs / erupt  / from the vegetation  / like maggots from a corpse<br/><br/>\tAnd finally, swayed by Odysseus\xe2\u20ac\u2122 cries, the drowned ghost Hecktor guides the ship from the matted sea<br/><br/>Faroes <br/><br/>\tIslanders stinking / like dung burned over a guttering flame / demand / that the mariners / marry / their ill-favored women<br/>\tOdysseus, Circe\xe2\u20ac\u2122s bane / raises his fist like an iron knot / strikes like a lighting bolt / upon one of the skunk women who / bursts / like a crushed pomegranate<br/>\tLike ants to honey /  a coveted magical helm / draws / Odysseus\xe2\u20ac\u2122 eyes <br/>\tHis will / like iron / Odysseus who heard the sirens song and lived / turns away<br/>\tLike a child drawn to a pretty bauble / Clythes, a fool / puts on / the helm / and dances for / Odysseus, Circe\xe2\u20ac\u2122s bane<br/>\tLike a kindly father / Thyris the aged veteran / takes / Clythes, a fool / by the ear<br/>\tThyris the aged veteran /  swears by Bacchus / to smite / the fool / for his trespasses  <br/><br/>\tAnd so with Clythes their fool left for dead the crew depart the Faroes with heavy hearts<br/><br/>Rus<br/><br/>Like sirens / the Rus, dressed in furs and silks / tempt / Bandy legged Odysseus / as a soft bed lures a tired man<br/>Like a wrestler feigning exhaustion / the clever schemer / pretends to luxuriate / in the silks and furs of Rus<br/><br/>And so during the night Odysseus flees with his crew, yet Abner, too drunk to stand, remains behind<br/><br/>Taiga <br/><br/>\tLost / amid trees like pillars to Olympus / was / blood-marked Odysseus<br/>\tLike a sailor returned from sea / Odysseus of parentage strange and uncertain / is at home / with the bowman with eyes afire<br/> <br/>And so twenty days later they emerge from the Taiga but alas Artellis is no longer among their company<br/><br/>Cathay<br/><br/>An ambassador from a far-off land / Circes\xe2\u20ac\u2122 bane / is summoned / before the emperor / of the teeming masses<br/>The emperor / of strange Cathay / demands / Hippocrates, mender of limbs, drawer of poison, solace to the dying<br/>Like a jealous lover / mistrustful of strangers / The Emperor / plans to kill / after the examination<br/>Odysseus, Circe\xe2\u20ac\u2122s bane / on the bones of his father / curses the Emperor / to languish is his vast palace/  sickly and weak / for the rest of his days<br/><br/>And so Odysseus, Circe\xe2\u20ac\u2122s bane, disguises honey-voiced Apos as the valued doctor before they escape this land. <br/><br/>Indochine<br/><br/>The maiden trapped atop the mountain / calls out / to the clever schemer<br/>Like a mountain goat / bandy leg\xe2\u20ac\u2122d Odysseus / climbs to / the maiden trapped atop the mountain<br/>Honeycomb-like / swampy Indochine / traps / bandy leg\xe2\u20ac\u2122d Odysseus / like a fly in amber / or a tiger in a pit<br/>Odysseus, much tossed by Poseidon\xe2\u20ac\u2122s waves / fortifies / on mysterious medicine<br/>Like the milk of the asp / the mysterious medicine / is a portal / to a world of dulled senses / like too much mead<br/>The clever schemer / extricates / himself / from Swampy Indochine / and like a wayward lamb / departs<br/>The maiden / curses the clever schemer / for kidnapping her / that he will never know rest / in the name of her barbarian god<br/><br/>And so Odysseus takes the maiden onto his ship and that night for the first time since leaving Ithaca, dreams of Penelope<br/><br/>Terra Australis<br/><br/>Odysseus, of parentage strange / like a curious child / beaches / on the land of wind and fire <br/>Drawn by relentless destiny / to the land of wind and fire / Odysseus / is / a lost lamb<br/><br/>And so, when the mariners sail, Hespertain the wanderer stays in Terra Australis to join the men who dream the world into being                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Evolution of the game<br/><br/>Actually, in some ways, we finally \xe2\u20ac\u02dcplayed\xe2\u20ac\u2122 this last session; the first two playtests had only gotten through 2 \xc2\xbd islands, with lots of discussions. The game design started out focused giving Odysseus and his mariners epithets and on mortality and wanderlust as two resources that would determine when Odysseus would die or settle down. Hexameter (filling six slots in your description) was a way to earn bonus dice for conflict resolution &amp; combat. We spent the second playtest reinventing the game. We kept epithets but let go of mortality/wanderlust, incorporating more on the language and metaphors of describing conflicts on islands and board gamey movement between islands. I told Josh and Judson that if I publish this, they\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll get co-system design credits.<br/><br/>I want to explain where some of the \xe2\u20ac\u02dcepic poem\xe2\u20ac\u2122 transcribed above came from. Player each have their own version of Odysseus, with 3 epithets, one short, one long, one medium. Players also control mariners (O\xe2\u20ac\u2122s crew), who each have one epithet. Players take turns controlling Odysseus. The other players decide what island will be visited next and create three epithets for that island. (We found that sometimes the epithets were three descriptors for a certain challenge on the island; other islands had three different features/ residents as epithets.) <br/><br/>So repeating phrases from the transcript like \xe2\u20ac\u02dcCirce\xe2\u20ac\u2122s bane,\xe2\u20ac\u2122 \xe2\u20ac\u02dcaged and bitter at her lost youth,\xe2\u20ac\u2122 \xe2\u20ac\u02dcfurs and silks\xe2\u20ac\u2122 are the epithets.<br/><br/>The island players launch into conflict. Players have to fill \xe2\u20ac\u02dchexameter\xe2\u20ac\u2122 lines (six slots) with their choice of four kinds of phrases: epithets, metaphors, actions, and dying curses. Each type of phrase fills a certain number of slots. Short epithets fill one, mediums two and long epithets three. Metaphors always fill one slot regardless of length. Action phrases fill one slot per noun or verb phrase (this needs to be better defined). Curses fill one slot per component of the curse, which we defined as: Target of curse/ what will happen / when will it occur / where will it occur / in whose name / how or why it happens. Each slot you fill gives you a six sided dice with the color corresponding to one of the four kinds of phrases. You roll the six dice and try to get pairs, triplets etc. (it doesn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t matter the value of the sets). You need to match or exceed the set your opponent just rolled; if you don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t the challenge is over. The dice with the high set that allowed you to win determine the mechanical outcome of the scene. For example, if Odysseus wins with a metaphor among the victorious set of dice, then the player controlling Odysseus gets to give a new epithet to his Odysseus. The side that wins gets to narrate a final (non hexameter) line to sum up what happens and how the crew leaves the island. <br/><br/>Some lines to show how the six slots were filled:<br/><br/>Penelope, aged and bitter at her lost youth  [long epithet = 3] / cries [action 1] / tears [action 1 ] / like a stream cascading down to dash upon jagged rocks [metaphor 1]<br/><br/>Like sirens [metaphor 1] / the Rus, dressed in furs and silks [medium epithet 2] / tempt [action 1] / Bandy legged Odysseus [short epithet 1] / as a soft bed lures a tired man [metaphor 1]<br/><br/>Islanders stinking [short epithet 1] / like dung burned over a guttering flame [metaphor 1] / demand that the mariners [action 1] / marry [action 1] / their ill-favored women [medium epithet 2]<br/><br/>Odysseus, Circe\xe2\u20ac\u2122s bane [short epithet 1] / on the bones of his father [curse in whose name 1] / curses the Emperor [curse target 1] / to languish is his vast palace [curse where 1]/  sickly and weak [curse what happens 1] / for the rest of his days [curse when 1]<br/><br/>While there are some areas that still need testing, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m happy with the basic island creation and verbal exuberance of conflicts                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
