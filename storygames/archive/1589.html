                    I'll come back with a big post here soon, but I just wanted to set a thread aside for anybody who was involved in CN0, whether you ended up going or not, to post feedback, lessons learned, etc.  Some ideas on what to post:<br/><br/>1) What went well at CN0 or in its prep?<br/>2) What do you think should be done differently next time? How? <br/>3) What were you glad you brought? What do you wish you'd thought to bring?<br/>4) New games you tried, old games you tried, other things you did that you'd like to talk about. Link to any actual play threads from games you played at CN0 please<br/><br/>And whatever else you want to say about it. I had a fabulous time, enjoyed meeting everybody, and will post in detail soon.<br/><br/>Dave                </div>

                            A few of my lessons learned - stuff I would want to do differently as organizer, or that I would recommend to organizers of similar events in the future:<br/><br/>1) Have people reserve a spot by paying, not by posting &amp; then paying later. Easier for everyone that way, nobody gets feelings hurt or has to nag about payment. Set a date by which people need to register or the price goes up. <br/><br/>2) Set a refund policy in advance - there turned out to be a couple of people who paid &amp; then couldn't come and this was a gray area I hadn't defined. Nobody asked for money back, and I would have had no problem giving it, but that situation could have been less awkward if everybody knew in advance what the deal would be in that situation.<br/><br/>3) Don't provide all the food - no matter how helpful people are willing to be, you'll lose some gaming time and its a pain to have to shop for it and transport it. I'm told big LARPs generally will provide one big meal for everyone together and then snacks outside of that. That seems about right. I'd tell everyone (who was driving) to bring snacks and water and soft drinks to spare, and let people mostly fend for themselves with respect to what they're eating when.   However, sharing is a beautiful thing - it was great to have slow cookers with chili or soup or oatmeal going for people to just come to and partake of, and it'd be a shame if there was none of that spirit of sharing going on at future events.<br/><br/>4) That said, I think designated breaks/mealtimes keep people on the same schedule. There were a couple of times where people who were doing their own food got needlessly left out of gaming because they were doing a meal when everyone else was ready to game. <br/><br/>5) Try not to mix gaming spaces with non-gamer activities - we were using one lodge (because it had outlets &amp; a fireplace) for everything, and there were times when the gaming was interrupted by meals being prepped or by people outside the game who were genuinely interested but not helpful to the game. In particular, I think that we'd want any games that were going to have adult themes or content to be in a place separate from anyplace that children would be. Better for everyone that way; nobody has to worry about offending or being offended. <br/><br/>There may be more but those are most of my big 'lessons learned' I wanted to get out of my head.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Younce</cite><br/>1) What went well at CN0 or in its prep?</blockquote>
The whole thing was a positive experience for me. I like meeting folks I only know from online.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Younce</cite>2) What do you think should be done differently next time? How?</blockquote>
Other than being bigger, I can't really think of anything at the moment.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Younce</cite>3) What were you glad you brought? What do you wish you'd thought to bring?</blockquote>
Glad I brought: extra propane, powerful lantern, dish-cleaning supplies, wood saw, extra camp lighter.<br/><br/>Wish I brought: a bigger saw, meals that were faster to prepare (so as not to miss out on gaming), gloves, more blankets, a space heater.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Younce</cite>4) New games you tried, old games you tried, other things you did that you'd like to talk about. Link to any actual play threads from games you played at CN0 please</blockquote>
I got to try Misery Bubblegum and Tenra Bansho [sp?]. Yay! They were both fun, but they were the only RPGs I played. Boo! I pulled out the Jungle Speed and had lots of fun (and injuries) with that.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Younce</cite>And whatever else you want to say about it.</blockquote>
Not buying in for the group food due to dietary concerns left me feeling a bit separate from the rest of the group. Next time, I'll definitely buy in for food, but have my own easy-to-make meals available if needed.                        </div>

<em>1) What went well at CN0 or in its prep?</em><br/>Big ups to Dave for organizing and facilitating.  Your prep and implementation was as close to flawless as I can imagine.<br/>A lot of games got played, which was important to me as a goal. <br/>The location is perfect, both in terms of facilities and driving distance for weast coast participants.<br/><br/><em>2) What do you think should be done differently next time? How?</em><br/>Obivously the weather did not entirely cooperate.  Nothing to be done about that.<br/>I felt bad that the gamer/non-gamer ratio got skewed so far toward gamers, since the original idea was to bring all your people into the woods for woodsy fun.  Next time we either need to make sure it'll be a broad-based thing with activities for non-gamers or just say gamers only.  Or something.  It needs to be addressed.<br/>I felt that it took some discipline to move from hanging around talking to playing games, and the friction only increases with more people.  So if Nerdly grows, we may need more structure, more planning, or more motivation to start rolling dice.  <br/><br/><em>3) What were you glad you brought? What do you wish you'd thought to bring?</em><br/>When I left I had to choose between a light sleeping bag liner and a blanket or a -20F rated down bag.  I chose wrong - <em>way wrong</em>.<br/>I wish I'd brought a few bars of hand soap.   I wish my stove had worked for boiling water.<br/><br/><em>4) New games you tried, old games you tried, other things you did that you'd like to talk about. </em><br/>I got to play Perfect, a full game of AGON, and Dance Dance Kevin Allen Jr. for the first time.  I got to <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21837.0" rel="nofollow">run TSOY</a> and play Dogs, Infected, and 4-player Memoir '44.  I did a playtest of my Vampire Hunters thing.  Remi and I taught an improv workshop.  There was a lot of casual design discussion that was really useful.  More thoughts as I collect them...                        </div>

<i>1) What went well at CN0 or in its prep?</i><br/><br/>Everyone got there pretty easily, and everyone had a nice, relaxed atmosphere going.  Things that needed to be done on-site (like, for instance, figuring out which games to play) happened without anyone having to go all "I'm the boss!"  Everyone understood that the point was to have fun, and went along with pretty much any suggestion that headed in that direction.<br/><br/><i>2) What do you think should be done differently next time? How?</i><br/><br/>Assigned cabins and bunks would be helpful.  I finished off a late night game of Jungle Speed, and then was sitting there thinking "Hey ... where <i>do</i> I go to sleep, anyway?"  Turned out to be fine (there was a spare bed in an obvious place) but I could totally imagine being in a situation where I couldn't find a bed because I didn't want to be flashing a light over the faces of the sleeping people who were in the same room as the bed that was available for me.<br/><br/>I understand that one can hire people to dump a cord of fire-wood just about anywhere.  Hiring people to dump a cord of fire-wood along the wall of the main cabin would have given us noticeably more time for gaming, and a noticeably warmer environment.  Of course, that's likely to be completely irrelevant if we run in the spring.  Then we'll probably be talking about bringing enough rubber mats to make mud-free paths between cabins, and extra towels and socks for those who don't have enough.  I guess the general point is "Don't merely prepare for the environment, prepare for the environment in a way that <i>won't cost you time and comfort at the camp.</i>"<br/><br/><i>3) What were you glad you brought? What do you wish you'd thought to bring?</i><br/><br/>Glad I brought a decent sub-zero sleeping bag.  It kept me cozy.  I learned for the first time (from others) about the existence of sleeping bags that are <b>not </b> rated to sub-zero temperatures.  Strange concept.<br/><br/>Wish I'd brought a flash-light.  Waking up in a dark room in a dark cabin in a dark forest is creepy.  I'm used to city-glow.<br/><br/><i>4) New games you tried, old games you tried, other things you did that you'd like to talk about.</i><br/><br/>Got to play Shock: , for which we were all thoroughly punch-drunk ... which made it wonderful, but not (I strongly suspect) in the way it was intended.<br/><br/>Got to play Misery Bubblegum, which (as always) gives me both a warm feeling of "Yay!  It sorta works!" and thoughts about improvement.<br/><br/>Got to play Tenra Bansho Zero, which ... huh.  A lot less revolutionary and a lot more traditional than I'd expected from Andy's descriptions.  I was fascinated to watch how a task resolution system where there is no mechanical support for doing the things I, as a player, want to achieve immediately fostered all of the same exact dysfunctions in me that I remember from my play of a decade ago.  I am not a more productive gamer now then I was then (and I was <b>bad</b> then) I am simply more able to steer away from the systems that bring out my bad habits.  Sorry, everyone, for the trouble I caused at the table!<br/><br/>I honestly think that the emphasis was <i>too much</i> on new games, or old games reinterpreted in a wacky new way.  Maybe that loosened up on Sunday (which I had to miss), but my sense from Friday and Saturday was that nobody wanted to bother playing a game that we were sure would rock (like, say, Dogs or PTA).  I understand (and share) the desire to try new things, but the result is that this was not a spectacular weekend for me in terms of <i>actual gaming</i>.  Everything else?  Great.  The gaming?  Mediocre with flashes of great.<br/><br/>The improv workshop, however, was pure awesome, limited only by the fact that we didn't have enough time for everyone to do as much improv as they wanted (at least not enough for <i>me</i>!  I can't speak to anyone else)                        </div>

<b>1) What went well at CN0 or in its prep?</b><br/><br/>Dave Motherf---ing Younce. That's what went well in its prep.<br/><br/>Also, I agree with all sentiments above.<br/><br/><b>2) What do you think should be done differently next time? How?</b><br/><br/>I agree with Jason M, and think that maybe making it expressly gamer-centric might make the whole thing rock hard. And if it builds up to the point where we have enough mass in a couple years, maybe make it an open event in 2-3 years, have a Boardgame and Crafts Center for families to engage in fun together.<br/><br/>But until that happens, I'd like to see a Roleplayers/Gamers Only sign virtually fixed to the event. That way we can let down our hair and describe our NANO BLOOOOD or our GEISHA MASSSSSSSACRE or our AZTEC SACRIFICE IN THE LAND OF THE DROWNED MEEEEEEEEEEN without worrying about someone getting upset or worried.<br/><br/>Also, next time, I'm definitely thinking Late or Early Summer. It was cold, and next time even if we do it in the cold again, we will be much better prepared. And yet, having said that, it still would have been nice to be able to game outside, or game in a cabin, or game at the playground, without worrying about getting a cold. To do that, we need to game when it's warmer out.<br/><br/>When you add up all the days I've ever been camping (real camping with tents and hikes and stuff) it comes out to about a year and a half of my life. So I have no problem with camping in the fall or the winter, and can in fact have a lot of fun. But when the focus isn't on the hardcore camping, but rather the gaming and social fun, then yeah a warmer clime is ideal.<br/><br/><b>3) What were you glad you brought? What do you wish you'd thought to bring?</b><br/><br/>I'm glad I brought games and a warm hat. I saw the weather forecast, saw "night: 33 degrees", and somehow just didn't register that that means ITS FUCKING COLD! So I didn't bring my thermal bag, my heavy had, my thick warm coat, or even warmth luxury items like a space heater.<br/><br/><b>4) New games you tried, old games you tried, other things you did that you'd like to talk about. Link to any actual play threads from games you played at CN0 please</b><br/><br/>I ran Tenra which was both awesome and sucky (but got me to forehead-slap, whcih I'll relay in a sec), and I played Don't Rest Your Head in a total Surreal Hardcore Action vibe, also played Shock: ("Shock! We're playing D &amp; D, bitches!"), Aztec TSOY, and... crap, what else... something else.<br/><br/>I expect the gaming to be less that super-awesome, and even "high mediocre" is cool for me, as most of the time I'm just chilling meeting and talking to friends from online, getting used to new players and playstyles and all, but most of all I think the limitations that the cold provided (to Be Warm, everyone had to pretty much game in one small, loud room) turned the dial down on the Hardcore Gaming Amp.<br/><br/>Oh, and Tony, not to derail, but yeah RIGHT after you left I forehead-slapped myself and realized what I did wrong. At the end we were both pretty brain-dead and tired, you saying "I can't see how my Fates relate", and me saying (wihtout looking at the sheet) "Why do you think your fates don't relate"?  So, when you make a character in Tenra, to get things moving, you can either choose a Premade character that each have built-in fates, or make up a character by stapling 2-5 Archetypes together: Each archetype has one unique fate, and if you choose 4 archetypes, you pick the Two Fates you want to start with and write those down.<br/><br/>Well, when I made the Miko character I specifically thought "Tony will love to play this kind of character", whcih is why I chose it. However, I didn't pay too much attention when I used the sample premade character to what the Fates on the Sheet were: "Family's Honor" and "Loyalty to the Priesthood".  Although I did thoroughly think about the other characters' Fates and how to really get them into the adventure and gradually 'screw with them", when it came to your character I totally had nothing, zilch, pop up in the game by the first hour which engaged either of those Miko's Fates. If I had more insight into that, I would have had the family take a bigger role (maybe you're tring to find a family member or atone for a family sin; and have more conflict between the Priesthood and the Common People or something).  But it was late at night and I was like, "I'll just throw shit at y'all and watch y'all react to it!" So yeah, that was totally my bad there.<br/><br/>Which in the end, of course, is an awesome opportunity to write more explanation text in the game so that people don't pull my boneheaded move! :-)                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>maybe making it expressly gamer-centric might make the whole thing rock hard.</blockquote>
Making the event expressly family-unfriendly makes it expressly unfriendly as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>If we have a game space set aside for games where kids are not permitted, that's fine, but asking me not to bring my kids is asking me not to come, and if that's what you're saying then we're at an impasse.                        </div>

                            Sorry to toss out that can of worms, but there was one more step in the process, which upon thinking a little more about it, I think that meeting in a warmer season might help with:<br/><br/>So we did have non-gamers, but because of the cold and all, we were all in one room for most of the time. We want to be inclusive and all, but a lot of the games that we were playing had mature themes and the like.  On one occasion, our group was chastised for saying something that could have been interpreted as non-kid friendly.  I felt bad about that outburst and wanted to do more to make the environment more friendly to non-gamers, without cramping the style of the majority of folks.  Unfortunately, again because of the weather we were pretty much stuck in one area, so we just had to watch what we said.<br/><br/>I think if the next one took place in a warmer climate, some folks could just say, "OK, we're getting together a game of Dogs in the Vineyard, since it will probably have mature themes let's all go outside to the picnic table in front of cabin 2 and play there". (or wherever). It will be much easier to split off and not worry about inappropriate speech or behavior if it is warmer out. Meanwhile, more non-gamer-friendly games could totally go down in the group's communal area and the like.<br/><br/>So the Time of Year issue might kill two birds with one stone (warmth and inclusion).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Andy:  In the Virginia/Maryland area I think it will be pretty much <i>impossible</i> to find a season where there isn't a decent chance of being forced indoors.  If you're free of any risk of cold then you've plowed right into the risk of torrential rains.  The season is important, because you can jimmy the odds, but the weather is always going to be a gamble somehow or other.                        </div>

                            Man, I'd rather caution people a lot about the possibility of cold weather than move the camp into the Insanity Zone that is the summer Con season. It's camping, people! If you want to be 100% comfortable (and putting it in June makes mosquitoes, heat, and torrential rain all factors) we really should just have another Con in a hotel. Weather stuff can, and will, happen. Roll with it. I'm NOT an experienced camper by any stretch of the imagination, and I was perfectly comfortable Saturday night, after having taken Andy and Jason's simple advice about keeping warm.                        </div>

                            Well, with rain and heat, one can always retire to the other cabins with the tables for gaming. Or set up a tarp over a picnic table for rain, and wear long sleeves to protect against mosquitos.<br/><br/>But with the cold, we're either all crammed into one heated room, or we're playing games alone and in the cold like it was valley forge.  I don't mind telling stories wearing thermals, thick gloves, Sorel boots and a double-lined winter coat, but it's much harder to roll dice or flip through books.<br/><br/>Still, though, knowing what I know now will make next year, even under the same or even slightly colder conditions, much better.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Fine, Dee Why, I'll chime in already!<br/>
<br/>
<b>1) What went well at CN0 or in its prep?</b><br/>
<br/>
Damn, you floored me. I have been to tons of group-oriented gaming in the woods events, and the sheer amount of warm and cold food available was <i>insane</i>! The camp was beautiful and really well-priced. The dice and shirts (shout-out to Remi) were a great takeaway. On location: I took Friday off to make the drive down easy, and the drive back Sunday afternoon was totally doable.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2) What do you think should be done differently next time? How?</b><br/>
<br/>
The LARP idea of one big meal and snacks is ideal. Splitting the snacks-transport duties would be key, as well. I loved the idea of a crockpot of chili on at all times, and I think it would easily happen  wiht this group at CN1.<br/>
<br/>
<b>3) What were you glad you brought? What do you wish you'd thought to bring?</b><br/>
<br/>
I was glad I brought everything I did, and upset that I didn't bring my boots (I thought they were packed, but they weren't). Luckily it didn't rain/snow.<br/>
<br/>
<b>4) New games you tried, old games you tried, other things you did that you'd like to talk about. Link to any actual play threads from games you played at CN0 please</b><br/>
<br/>
All of the games I tried were new, and I had a blast playing all of them. I played Agon, TSOY, Infected, and Danite DitV (+ Dance Dance Kevin Allen Jr.). I am a pretty big fan of D&amp;D, as is my usual gaming group, so I don't get to try new indies often (usually we end up playing Mountain Witch, which is great, but no longer new). I felt great trying new games, and really enjoyed playing with all the groups for each game. I especially loved having a scripture expert in Dogs.                        </div>

                            1) What went well at CN0 or in its prep?<br><br>There was tons of food. Everyone seemed to find the place okay (and by that, I mean that I didn't overhear anyone complain about getting lost). Dave Yonce is awesome.<br/><br/>People totally arranged to pick me up from airports, help me get to and from CN0, and all that stuff - and that was awesome. (Dave, Remi, Morningstar + Autumn, you guys rulez).<br/><br/>2) What do you think should be done differently next time? How? <br/><br/>If there are non-gamers, there should be a room for... non-gaming activities. Arts, crafts, maybe some board-gamey things and Jungle Speed. If there are non-gamers coming who are also cooking fanatics, maybe the non-gaming room also turns into a kitchen-of-sorts.<br/><br/>This isn't to say that I am trying to exclude people - I'm actually trying to figure out how best to incorporate non-gamers. I felt like (at CN0) Anita and William were a bit cast aside - they weren't gaming and there were no non-gaming activities for them to take part in (aside from Improv).<br/><br/>So, a division like gaming/non-gaming or adults/children would be good, in terms of rooms.<br/><br/>On a similar note, I tend to say "Fuck that noise, I slice your head off" or some similar sentiment quite frequently while gaming (and living, in general). I did feel awkward having to censor my speech around kids. I sort of spent a lot of money to go to Camp Nerdly, hoping to be able to drop the censored speech that I have to use where I live. If that makes sense.<br/><br/>3) What were you glad you brought? What do you wish you'd thought to bring?<br/><br/>Jason brought a bunch of stuff for me, and I'm eternally grateful for that.<br/><br/>Things that are essential - good sleeping bag, blanket, something for the ears (a hat with flaps, I reccomend!), thick socks.<br/><br/>4) New games you tried, old games you tried, other things you did that you'd like to talk about.

                            Joe, how the hell did we manage to NOT run our games for one another? I just realized this, and I'm kicking myself in the head for not thinking of it at Nerdly.                        </div>

                            Andrew -<br/><br/>I played Perfect as the opening game of Nerdly, for the Morningstar, Remi, and Yonce Master 5000. I was just all Perfect'ed out after that.<br/><br/>And... I played Unistat at Gencon, so its not SUCH a tragedy I couldn't again. I mean, I would have liked to, but there was so much uncharted territory there that I had to explore.                        </div>

                            I think it'd be great if you ran a game aimed at younger participants.<br/><br/>I've rechecked the 'Game Planning Thread' and you gave no indication of anyone's participation from your family except you, Fred. So I'm sorry you felt they were being left out - but I think everyone was justified in believing it would be adults only at their tables and planning games as such.                        </div>
