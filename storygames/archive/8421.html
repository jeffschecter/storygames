It won an award, if that has any meaning whatsoever.  It's also the best game I've ever written, which has some meaning for me at least.<br/><br/>It's a GMless high/weird fantasy game, in which six players control three characters.  In a magical land where the physical and spirit worlds collide, the God King dwells.  On the eve of his wedding to a foreign sorceress, a mysterious stranger comes to his castle, which will cause the situation to explode.<br/><br/>Each character is controlled by two players, who switch control under specific conditions.<br/><br/>The conflict resolution system definitely falls under the "one absolutely brilliant thing looking for a better game" criteria: one player describes two things that happen, but the other player decides who they happen to.  <br/><br/>If you check it out, you should also see the <a href="http://game-chef.com/af2008/comments.php?DiscussionID=82&amp;page=1#Item_0" rel="nofollow">beautiful art</a> it was made to accompany.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186375/#Comment_186375" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T15:35:30+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  3:35PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jedibunny</cite>can you guarantee that the game in question approaches the issue of intense intimacy between women in a responsible and politically correct manner?</blockquote>\nHmm, that is a tough question, actually. Firstly, I think the game treats its subject matter in a responsible manner, though it is always possible to play irresponsibly. Secondly, "politically correct" is a rather loaded term - I'll assume you mean the good kind of PC, even though I immediately think of the bad kind of PC. It's maybe 50/50.<br/><br/>It is un-PC in a good way - it's about ass-kicking chicks. The game explicitly de-protagonizes men and protagonizes women, which interferes with attempts to objectify them, and forces narration in a certain direction - I'd like to think it tackles issues like society's view of powerful women in a manner similar to <i>Trollbabe</i>, but I can't be certain. Certainly, if the endgame consequences of those scenes of intimacy are played out as intended, the characters can't help but become deeper and more humanized.<br/><br/>But it's not un-PC in a bad way. It's not crass, it's not about pin-up girls, it won't get me a job writing for Hustler. These women aren't just sexy, or even just sexy and deadly - they have to be smart and tough, too. It also takes a fairly international perspective, in influence and references.<br/><br/>And it's not PC in a bad way. It's a violent game, there's no whitewash of that. And it doesn't downplay any of the drama inherent in the struggle between kick-ass women.<br/><br/>So yes, I think it is a responsible product all-around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186415/#Comment_186415" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T18:09:05+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  6:09PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm firmly against the idea that there is any such thing as a good form of politically correct.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will set my stance and glare across the war-torn field and say that this game handles the themes maturely and responsibly, but in a completely un-politically correct way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese women are the epitome of pornographic fantasy broken out of the constraints of the adolescent male mind, blown up to larger-than-life proportions, and dead set on kicking ass, taking names and finding the really real core at the center of the fantasy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Ladies are by turns crude and elegant, brazen and subtle. Sometimes both extremes will be present in the same Lady. At all times, however, they are Sexy, Deadly, Smart and Tough. All of these are a part of their arsenal that they will use ruthlessly against their foes, be they mere men or their peers.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan the game be played in an immature, irresponsible fashion? Absolutely. The rules make no judgments upon the narration at the table. Only your fellow players can do that. Can it be played politically correct? God, I hope not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ozbot" title="ozbot"><img alt="ozbot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/nCTCPKSKDL4Z7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ozbot">ozbot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186750/#Comment_186750" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T23:29:09+00:00" title="January  7, 2009 11:29PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I was pleasantly surprised with how my Genre Redesign turned out.
