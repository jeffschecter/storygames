I\u2019d never written something like that before, and it was fun and challenging<br/><br/>- Socially, I\u2019ve tried to design some of the procedures in the game so that the players get to know more about each other as they play.<br/><br/><br/><b>Short version of the rules</b><br/>You choose a character to play from a list of Family Members, and decide what your Family Member wants for this episode. <br/><br/>You\u2019ll all take turns being the Star of a scene. As the Star, you describe how your Family Member tries to get what she wants. <br/><br/>During the scene, all the other players do the following: <br/>- ask leading questions about how you're trying to achieve your goal<br/>- pretend to be guest stars who appear in the scene <br/>- suggest things that could happen (which the Star can accept or ignore) <br/>- play the audience, responding with laughs and 'awwws' just like a studio audience or laugh track. <br/><br/>But everyone else also competes to introduce something that could go horribly wrong in the Star's scene. If things do go wrong, the person who introduced the worst-case scenario gets closer to winning the game.<br/> <br/><br/><b>Origin story</b><br/>I\u2019ve been working on Bad Family since 2004 \u2013 it\u2019s the first game I seriously sat down to write after visiting the Forge for the first time. <br/><br/>That first version went through three rounds of playtesting at local cons and with friends, and it became quite a complicated game. The feedback I received caused me to put it on the shelf for about three years.<br/><br/>Obviously my sub-conscious was mulling over it: two and a half months ago I got hit with an epiphany about how to simplify the game. Whereas the original version had a game board and various types of tokens and points you had to track, in this new version players have to collect three cards (from an ordinary deck) to win.<br/><br/><br/><b>Who am I?</b><br/>I'm a New Zealand based writer and script-writer. I wrote and directed a feature film comedy called \u2018hopeless\u2019, and co-created its 26-part sit-com spin-off, Love Bites. (These are terrible titles, and I can tell you some stories about working with production companies and networks some time.)<br/><br/>I edited Mike Sands' Apocalypse World hack, Monster of the Week. I\u2019ve written quite a few games for game competitions. My next project will be rewriting Left Coast, a game about sci-fi authors in 1960s California, which had quite a bit of playtesting and editing feedback over the last six months.<br/><br/><br/>Anyway, hope you enjoy Bad Family.

One-shots tend to go a little crazy with stuff happening like:<br/><br/>- a dad trying to impress Wayne Gretsky by bench-pressing a dolphin<br/>- an office rivalry escalating to the point where someone needs to defuse a nuclear bomb<br/>- a small child who wants to confront her fears about climbing a tree being blocked by the tree coming to life and mocking her.<br/><br/>But the game I've played in longest (about eight episodes now) has gotten a lot darker. It's a family that idolises the oldest son, Alex, who's perfect at everything (school, music, goes to Harvard, loved by the community) but is always off-screen. The legend of Alex has warped the entire family who are either trying to live up to his reputation, define themselves as separate people, being stalked by people who love Alex, or (in the case of the dad) are so focused on Alex that he neglects and forgets the rest of his children.<br/><br/>It's been really fun to watch, and we're now at the point where a lot of the characters have acknowledged that they're screwed up and they want to get better and be a better family ... but the game won't let them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_392638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/392638/#Comment_392638" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-07T15:17:12+00:00" title="October  7, 2012  3:17PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That Alex plot sounds like it could be an actual tv show!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_393066">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/393066/#Comment_393066" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-10T17:35:35+00:00" title="October 10, 2012  5:35PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, John.

I think the next phase is really to play the crap out of it.

It's looking really good! The rewrite since the last version has been time well-spent, I think. It's got a clear agenda, and rules that look like they'll consistently deliver on that.<br/><br/>I do have a few questions though.<br/><br/>In "Star" scenes, I'm not exactly clear on what play looks like up until the point when someone comes up with a "worst case scenario". The text makes it sound like the Star player is describing the scene, and the other players are asking questions and drawing out more material. The example of play, on the other hand, makes it seem like the other players are describing things happening in the scene which challenge the Star character. For what it's worth, I think the play as described in the examples seems more natural and fun. I wonder about whether it would feel like the Star player was providing their own antagonism otherwise.<br/><br/>The "Knock" player gets to take some cards and give them out and suchlike. I wonder if this rule is strictly needed. What purpose do you see it serving?<br/><br/>The "Worst Case Scenario" is really the heart of the game, and I think you've done some smart things to really make that mechanic central in every scene. It seems though that half the time, people are coming up with these great worst-case scenarios, but nothing comes of them. Is there a way of making red card narrations incorporate elements from the worst-case? Like, "everything described in the worst-case scenario happens, but it works out to the good of the Star character". You could almost have a table (an option for each card suit?) "The opposite of what was described happens instead" etc.<br/><br/>On that subject, I think it would be helpful to clarify the difference between the interjections the players make before "The Knock" and the content of the Knock itself. It seems like before the knock, players are saying things which present obstacles but also opportunities for the Star character to go after their Want. The Knock, on the other hand, is a definite description of the character utterly failing to get what they want. This is a case where I think maybe you rely overly on advice, where a hard rule might serve better.<br/><br/>That's all I've got. I really like how pared-down and minimal this game has become. It's a neat structure that I think will deliver on the promise of hilarious and quick games.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394022/#Comment_394022" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-19T19:28:32+00:00" title="October 19, 2012  7:28PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon, <br/><br/>Thanks. Your comments were the reason that I re-designed and simplified Bad Family the way I did. Good to know you appreciate how this gamma draft turned out.<br/><br/>I only have time to address a couple of your comments today, but you're absolutely right about players being able to 'describe stuff'. That happens very naturally in the game \u2013 as you noticed from the examples (which I transcribed from an Actual Play recording). I'll be adding a 'describe stuff' move into the next draft of the rules.<br/><br/>I\u2019ll have to think about (and test) your suggestion about how the Knock and the worst-case scenarios work. At the moment, the possibility of have a worst-case scenario happening or not introduces a delicious creative tension, and while there's definitely regret sometimes when the bad thing doesn't happen there\u2019s also laughter and relief. (Which is a cool emotion to have at the table!)<br/><br/>But I also like your idea about having the worst-case scenario definitely happen, but for it to be good or bad (depending on the card draw). Like I say, I\u2019ll test it.<br/><br/>More later!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394064/#Comment_394064" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-20T08:52:55+00:00" title="October 20, 2012  8:52AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 20, 2012 8:58AM by Rickard.">edited October 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a competitive aspect of Bad Family where you want to get 3-4 cards to "win", so why would you like to flip again to give away cards?<br/><br/>I was thinking of how it would affect the game if the star player would keep all cards, even the black ones, but you can only win the game by having three red cards.

My hope with the game is that the rules contribute to setting up a tension between 'being selfish' and 'being altruistic': I'm trying to make the rules create the social dynamics of a real family.<br/><br/>You're definitely trying to grab as many cards as you can, so there's a real reluctance to give them away. However, in Family scenes (where the whole family gathers and their problems intersect), you gather cards if someone decides that your Family Member has helped them the most during their entire experience of playing Bad Family to date (not just the previous round of scenes; it includes in all of the previous episodes, too).<br/><br/>I'm trying to create a gamble - that a bit of altruism now (giving your cards away in Star scenes) will help you a lot, later.<br/><br/>But I have to keep playtesting whether this works (it's seemed to in my most recent games), whether the balance of risk and reward is right (I'm totally not sure about this) or whether the whole trade-off is just a bit too complicated for the simple game I want to write.<br/>\n<blockquote><i>I was thinking of how it would affect the game if the star player would keep all cards, even the black ones, but you can only win the game by having three red cards.

When you say 'introducing your character' are you suggesting introducing a different family member in addition to the current star of the scene?</blockquote>\nI gave that suggestion before I read about the family scene and the ending, and I can see how my suggestion doesn't work with the rest. Just finished reading it - I printed it out as a A5 folder - and will probably run this some time in the future, and it will be one of the games I will bring to the story games room at the Swedish conventions.<br/><br/><b>What I really liked</b><br/>\xd7 The language and the structure of the text. It feels like you talk to people that haven't played roleplaying games before, and I like it. I like the tone, the suggestions on how to think, and for most part the order of how you explain things. The text is a little to long for my taste (with 49 pages), but I read through it quickly because of your good language. And I really love that you repeat the structures at the end of each chapter.<br/>\xd7 The theme, where you use tropes to easily make people understand what the game is about. Name drop a few TV series, have a fixed number of family members that everybody can recognize, and the players are ready to go.<br/>\xd7 I really like that the information about the family will grow for each session. A friend and I talked about how we wanted to have a one-shot-game that developed over the time, and this is somewhat a wish came true. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\xd7 Asking questions instead of giving suggestions. There was a lot of things in this game that I already do. This is one of them. Suggestions can kill the inspiration where questions feed it.<br/>\xd7 The suggested tutorial is appreciated, but as I read through the rest, I wondered if I actually needed the tutorial. I would probably start the game with a star scene where I ask all the questions, and when the first step is over, explaining that everybody can start to ask questions. I actually think that all I need is the information that I can find on the character sheet.<br/>\xd7 The character sheet, where you put a summary. That's excellent, because I always has to do a summary to all games. I don't know why game designers don't do this to all their games.<br/><br/><b>Could be better</b><br/>- It's hard to see when an old chapter ends and a new is starting. You should use bigger headlines for Star scenes, Family scenes, End scenes and so on.<br/>- I don't like the competitive part of the game. I can understand why you got it, but it contradict some of the mechanics in the game where you share or give away cards. I started to come up with suggestions, but I realized that I changed the whole game and you're probably finished with the playtesting. But I personally prefer when a game going towards something, with or without the players consent, instead of giving out rewards or having a competition.<br/>- I think the tutorial should come before explaining the star-, family- and end scenes. And I wonder if you need pages 17-24 explaining the star scenes <i>again</i>. I would prefer the tutorial going through star scenes and then the section with social advice. <br/>- The family tree pictures on pages 26-27 is slightly hard to read. It could be because I printed the folder in A5 with low quality. You could perhaps turn the pictures 90\xb0 so you don't have to decrease the size of the pictures so much?<br/>- - I really don't like how a major number of story games have the same structure when it comes to playing out scenes; frame a scene; build-up to the roll; roll; end the scene. It's kind of repetitive, and I would like to have a more fluent structure where you vary yourself with either building relations or getting in trouble. The family scene is probably there to break this pattern, but it's not not enough because how you handle when the family scene occurs is repetitive in itself.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I got some more comments about the text, but I will leave that for later. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394986/#Comment_394986" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-26T19:40:59+00:00" title="October 26, 2012  7:40PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the feedback, Rickard.

It seems like before the knock, players are saying things which present obstacles but also opportunities for the Star character to go after their Want. The Knock, on the other hand, is a definite description of the character utterly failing to get what they want. This is a case where I think maybe you rely overly on advice, where a hard rule might serve better.</i><br/><br/>You're right: there is something going on here ... but I can't quite articulate it yet. In some ways, the obstacles are like soft moves in Apocalypse World: things could go wrong but they're mostly there to either give the character a chance to react or to provide the other players with inspiration about things that might go wrong. In the same way, the Knock is sort of like a hard move.<br/><br/>But the analogy isn't perfect. I'll think about it more. In the meantime, did you have an idea of what the 'hard rule' version of this might look like? I can't quite imagine it from what you've written.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395095/#Comment_395095" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-27T22:16:09+00:00" title="October 27, 2012 10:16PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Steve,<br/><br/>The rule might say something like: <br/><br/>"Players other than the Star, you can describe anything you like happening in the scene, you can introduce new characters, have them say and do whatever you like, and invent anything you want about the world and the people in it. But: <br/>1) You can't say anything about what the Star character does, thinks, or feels. That's up to the Star.<br/>2) You can't decide whether the Star gets or doesn't get their goal. You can throw obstacles or opportunities in their way, even things that make it very difficult or very easy to get what they want, but ultimately, what you describe must leave open the question of whether the Star gets their goal. If there's doubt about this, ask the other players if what you're describing leaves the goal open.<br/><br/>The Knock: When you knock, you can describe something happening in the scene, as normal, but the rules are slightly different. Instead of describing something happening, you invent a "Worst Case Scenario", something terrible that MIGHT happen. The rules for these are slightly different:<br/>1) You can't introduce any new characters [I just made this up now, but it's maybe a good idea].<br/>2) What you describe must irrevocably and unambiguously prevent the Star from getting their goal."<br/><br/>Does that make sense to you? I think I'm mostly describing what the rules already suggest you do, I'm just making explicit rules which someone can point to in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Himalayan_Salt" title="Himalayan_Salt"><img alt="Himalayan_Salt" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Himalayan_Salt">Himalayan_Salt</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395271/#Comment_395271" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-29T11:10:47+00:00" title="October 29, 2012 11:10AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've read over the rules, and I'd definitely like to try it out with some people.

I believe I gave some feedback on this point in the first draft, and I really like the way you've presented it in the text now. But I'd like to test that I'm reading you right. My reading is that:<br/><br/>In Bad Family, players are nominally competing to be first to win three cards, but that competition is all at the character level: We want to win because we want our characters to get what they want, not because it proves we're a better player than the others. Is that a correct reading? <br/><br/>We might decide that it's more important to let another character get what they want instead, and play would still be functional and meaningful, right? <br/><br/>Not like in, say, Old School D&amp;D, where deciding you don't want your character to survive is the same as deciding you don't want to play.<br/><br/>That's how the text reads to me, in any case, and I think that's a functional and useful approach. I especially like how it kind of makes success into a zero-sum game. Getting what you want implies that others will miss out. It has great potential to take the game some very dark places.<br/><br/>Am I reading your text correctly?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_396078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vasquas" title="vasquas"><img alt="vasquas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/218/n36TAGQMGPQ6H.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vasquas">vasquas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/396078/#Comment_396078" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-03T13:13:54+00:00" title="November  3, 2012  1:13PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2012 1:15PM by vasquas.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>That's great to hear, Giovanni - thanks for playing the game and for your feedback about the clarity of the instructions and the player handouts.<br/><br/>I'd love to hear what happened (and I'm struggling to learn Italian): if you decided you did want to post something about your game on a blog or an Italian RPG forum, could you link to it here?

Said and done: the game was on. I had forgotten most of the parts of the game so I played the game with my nose in my pamphlet. Should try to read it one more time before I bring it to another party this weekend.<br/><br/>I used the tag lines for the game, telling the participants that we were going to play a game where we all were going to be a part of a animated dysfunctional family. I name dropped the list of TV series from the book, and handed out the character sheets. I gave Simpsons and Family Guy some extra weight, because I thought most people had seen those shows.<br/><br/>Me and five other players started to choose from the list of the family members. I thought it took a little to much time to ask about in what order everybody was born, and it would be faster to just hand out the names and let the participants choose in clockwise order, starting from the player on my left. On the other side, the talk about who is the youngest in the family follows the theme of the game. Some of the participants had also just met each other for the first or second time so it's a kind of bonding as well to know if one player is the youngest, that another one had three half-siblings and things like that. So I ended up liking the idea of who chooses the family member first.<br/><br/>I continued explaining that all members will have a goal in the episode but only two will reach their goals. I gave some suggestions from my mind on what kind of goals that could exist to show that what the member's wanted could be anything from going out with the dog to start a nuclear plant. Four of the players (including me) knew directly what their characters should want to achieve on this session. I started to ask questions to the two remaining players, that wasn't really sure what their characters wanted. I asked why they choose those members and said that they could take anything in the everyday life or something that they wanted IRL. Finally, I handed out the list of the suggested Wants.<br/><br/>We used the following family mambers:<ul><li>Alex Jones: oldest child. Wanted to do drugs.</li>\n<li>Jamie Jones: middle child. Wanted to attend to a school party.</li>\n<li>River Jones: youngest child (can't really be the youngest, because there's an infant in the family, but hey...). Wanted to eat ice cream.</li>\n<li>Dick Jones: father. Wanted to go out with the dog.</li>\n<li>Bry Jones: lodger and family friend. Wanted to kill the cat.</li>\n<li>Annabel Jones: grandmother (on the fathers side). Wanted to throw Bry out of the house.</li></ul>\nWhen all this was done and the names (and who they were) written down on a piece of paper, I continued explaining that we were going to take turns and play out scenes where one of the member were the star (The direct translation of "star scene" into Swedish didn't sound that well, so I used "spotlight moment" instead). I started with the player to my right - I didn't really read out anything from my printed pamphlet - and asked the standard questions: "Who are you?" - "What do you want?" - "Where are you?" - "What hinders you from reaching what you want?". The first scene was about River Jones, who was grounded so she couldn't get to the fridge where all the ice cream were. After the regular questions, I told everyone that they could continue to ask questions, and I continued showing how by asking leading questions to River. After a while I knocked and explained how the rules worked for that.<br/><br/>It went on like this - on my turn (because I was the next person) - I introduced the flip by giving away my black card from the first knock. I introduces a Family scene when everybody had done one star scene but no cards was given out on the knock. To cut a long story short, the cat was shoved off the roof by Bry, and Annabel threw Bry out of the house. It took a little more than one hour to play, and we kept the story around the chosen family members - we did mentioned the mum being away but that was all. Everything went on smoothly and the players - where two haven't played this kind of games before - thought it was really easy to understand (especially compared to Fiasco), mostly because the game is based on a well known trope. The theme of the game made it easy to get inspiration for scenes, and the thing with always asking questions gave both pushed the player in the star scene and was easy to understand. We usually went from asking questions to play out scenes between family members which came naturally because this episode took part in and around the house. Two players pointed out that they liked that the names was non-gender specific.<br/><br/>When we played out the end scenes, we discovered that one player - one of the most silent ones - didn't get any cards. She lost both knocks in her star scenes and never knocked in another players scene. I dunno if that's a problem or not, but another player had five cards (needed three to win), mostly because he knocked even if he had already reached his goal. We established on the family tree that Alex - who didn't get any dope but instead smoked an embalmed ferret - had created a meth lab, I said that James became the coolest kid in school when she finally attended to the school party (even if he didn't reach what he wanted - a declared something for another player's family member), and grandma Annabel got someone to help her at home.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I think this will be an instant buy if you ever publish it. People thought it was very similar to Fiasco, but easier - mostly when it comes to the structures. No one said that they liked the competitive part, and thought it would ruin more than help the game if we had cared about it. One player - one of the more quiet ones - said several times that he wanted to play the game again, and I will bring this game to a couple of the Swedish roleplaying conventions and gatherings. Perhaps even play it with some other gamers + alcohol this weekend.

I have a tendency to get overly excited and take up a lot of space when I play these kinds of games and this was one of those times. I probably knocked a few times too many and may have blocked the other players by doing so.<br/><br/>An idea to "fix" this: The player with the most cards isn't allowed to knock unless all players are tied for first place. This will lengthen the duration of the game (regrettably) but also even it out and preventing it from ending in three straight scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_397033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397033/#Comment_397033" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-10T15:07:59+00:00" title="November 10, 2012  3:07PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great to hear that you enjoyed the game, Rickard and Rasmus!  Thanks for playing it.<br/><br/>I like the way you taught the game. It sounds like you didn\u2019t use any of the \u2018Introduce the Game\u2019 material. Is that right? Did you feel you had enough stuff (supporting characters, relationships, odd facts) on the Family Tree by the time you started your episode?<br/><br/>It's also good to hear about your doubts and eventual liking of the process for choosing family members. I\u2019m going to keep an eye on this in other playtests and see how it works.<br/><br/>Did you use the Rule of Cut? If so, what triggered it? What was the conversation like between the players to work out what would happen next?<br/>\n<blockquote><i>No one said that they liked the competitive part, and thought it would ruin more than help the game if we had cared about it.</i></blockquote>\nCan you expand on what you mean by the \u201ccompetitive part\u201d? I\u2019m also interested in how your group felt it would ruin things.<br/><br/>Rasmus, I like your suggestion. I just wanted to check in, though: one of the rules that probably should be on the cheat-sheet is that you can\u2019t knock twice in a row. Would that have changed things?<br/><br/>And again, thanks very much: I really appreciate the time you've taken to post your thoughts about the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL" title="RasmusL"><img alt="RasmusL" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL">RasmusL</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397096/#Comment_397096" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-11T12:08:00+00:00" title="November 11, 2012 12:08PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, it probably would change the situation and help solve the problem somewhat but low key players will still face the risk of being shut out by others that are more keen on knocking.<br/><br/>We tried out the fix i suggested above yesterday and I think it worked but two of the players felt blocked by not being allowed to knock.

I will comment as I go along.<br/><br/>PAGE 9<br/>"<i>Once everyone's studied the list, you'll all get a chance to choose a Family Member you're particularly interested in.</i>"<br/>If everybody studies the list, it can happen that two players want to play the same character. I just discussed with the others who was going first, and then I handed over the list to the youngest member in that player's family.<br/><br/>PAGE 18<br/>"<i>The player on the Star's left starts the Star scene by asking the Star's Family Member two questions.</i>"<br/>To better reconnect to who the Family Member is, I added two introductory questions before "Where are you?" and "What is making it difficult for you to reach your goal?". Those two questions are "Who are you?" and "What do you Want?".<br/><br/>By asking those two questions, we re-established who the Family Member was, so everyone was on the same page and could begin to start questions or knock. "What is making it difficult for you to reach your goal?" wasn't always asked, instead we asked questions until someone got enough inspiration to knock and come up with some sort of trouble.<br/><br/>PAGE 24<br/>"<i>A player who's already won can knock - but after narrating the worst case scenario, they give the black card away to another (non-star) player.</i>"<br/>I totally missed this. It could also include people who has the most cards, instead of having the rule that Rasmus suggested that disallowed the player with the most cards to knock.<br/><br/>PAGE 31<br/>"<i>...until two Family Members collect three cards (in the first game).</i>"<br/>I really like the idea of different number of cards for the first game and the following games, and also the rule that says that the ones who reached their Wants in the first game has to collect an additional cards.<br/><br/>PAGE 32<br/>"<i>To decide which player goes first in the end credit montage, the two people who won discuss and determine which of them is from the least typical family.</i>"<br/>I never did this, mostly because I didn't remember it. Instead we started with the player who was the youngest in the family. I don't really see the point of discussing about roles in the end game as well.<br/><br/>"<i>The winning player describes a short one-sentence scene...</i>"<br/>This didn't really happen, but we kept the scenes really short. It's more of an short epilogue to show the consequences of the Family Members acts in the episode.<br/><br/>PAGE 33<br/>"<i>Examples /.../ River wins an award for the web-series she's secretly filming about her family</i>"<br/>If you're going to write facts on a piece of paper, the paper will be filled rather quickly if you creates facts that are this long. "River won an series award" is a more realistic note, when it comes to what kind of space you got on the family tree.<br/><br/>"<i>You can only create facts on the Family Tree about other peoples' Family Members or guest stars.</i>"<br/>I totally missed this. Will start play with it the next session.<br/><br/>PAGE 40<br/>"<i>Now we're going to introduce the second basic concept. Pretending to be guest stars in the TV show we're creating.</i>"<br/>Didn't remember this either, but we didn't really need it. At least half the players in both times we played this, were used to this kind of games, and fell into creating guest stars naturally. And when they did that, it showed how it was done to the other players.<br/><br/>The thing is, and this is something that I've noticed, is that each star player round consist of first bombing the player of the Family Member with questions and then it always in some way goes into dialogue when a question creates a guest star. When the dialogue starts, the questions stops, and everything is played out instead. This is nothing that I've explained to the players. It just comes naturally.<br/><br/>PAGE 41<br/>"<i>Act out a short conversation between your character and the Star's Family Member ('short' means between one to three lines of dialogue each).</i>"<br/>In other words, our dialogues were a bit longer. One scene could take around one minute while other could take 5-10 minutes. I don't think that there can be a scene that is to long, because you got a rule for active listening (The Knock).\n<blockquote>I like the way you taught the game. It sounds like you didn\u2019t use any of the \u2018Introduce the Game\u2019 material.</blockquote>\nTo be honest, I thought I did. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> The introduction was really good because I got an idea of how I should explain the game. But now when I read it through again, I realize that I totally missed Introductory Round 1. On the other hand, I don't think it's really necessary if you instead got the two introductory questions "Who are you?" and "What do you Want?".<br/><br/>The introduction of guest stars is an important one, even if I never used it. Like I said in the above paragraph, introduction of the guest stars comes naturally when one of the questions creates one. It can be questions like "Who is in your way  of reaching your goal", "What kind of friends do your brother have?", "Are anyone in your presence?", "Why is the  police knocking on your door?". Sometimes we even had knocks created through dialogue. In the first session, grandma Annabel (the Star) wanted Bry out of the house - both were in the kitchen when I knocked and said "Dick sticks his head into the kitchen. "Annabel! Can you help Bry with the dinner?".<br/><br/>Now I realize that it says that we should have played the Introductory Rounds in turns, where everyone is playing out Round 1 before going to Round 2. I don't like that way of introducing the game, because it's going to be chopped upped. That's the reason why I explained the game as I did, playing out a full star scene with one player before it's the next players turn (which is my turn, because I started with the player on my right).\n<blockquote>Did you feel you had enough stuff (supporting characters, relationships, odd facts) on the Family Tree by the time you started your episode?</blockquote>\nWe just had the Family members, and I explained the setting (a house in a suburban area) and that was actually enough. We didn't need an introductory round more than "Who are you?" and "What do you Want?". Any guest star that we needed were created through the questions.\n<blockquote>Did you use the Rule of Cut?</blockquote>\nNo, but I did explain the rule. The second time we played, I pointed out the Rule of Cut (each time) when I saw that a player was really hesitant to answer a question, but the no one used the rule anyway.\n<blockquote>Can you expand on what you mean by the \u201ccompetitive part\u201d? I\u2019m also interested in how your group felt it would ruin things.</blockquote>\nThe second group thought the competitive part would ruin the game as well.  If you really want to play to win, you will never ever flip again or knock in the family scene to give someone else cards. You would also want to knock as soon as possible in a scene, even before things are established. I can't really see what the fun would be to play the game like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_397292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/397292/#Comment_397292" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-13T00:12:31+00:00" title="November 13, 2012 12:12AM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 13, 2012 12:26AM by Rickard.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We were eight people the second time we played and it took around 1,5 hours. Only two of the players (me included) were in the first session. We had been drinking for a couple of hours, which can explain some the facts in the family tree below. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I did the introduction in the same way as before, starting with the player on my right and asking questions to that player. The winning players had 3 and 4 cards at the end.<br/><br/>I wrote down the comments I got when we discussed the game afterwards.<br/><br/>- How do you get into the scene before someone knocks?<br/><br/>- Some scenes took a minute, others took 5-10 minutes.<br/><br/>- It's boring to have to use all cards of one colour to narrate or establish facts.<br/><br/>- What's the difference between narrating and establishing facts? Because when you establish facts, it still need some explanation why the fact is created.<br/><br/>- One player disliked how outcome of the scenes were handled.<br/><br/>- What does the game mechanic give to the gaming experience? If someone says "win", you don't want to give any cards away.<br/><br/>- The game created situations that brought down a lot of laughs.<br/><br/>- Liked that the facts remains after the sessions. The facts gives inspirations.  When people declared who they were going to play at the beginning of the session, I looked at the family tree and told them the established facts. Alex has for example a meth lab, and when I told the player who choosed Alex that, his Wants was to create drugs.<br/><br/>- About the questions if the rules helped creating guest stars: what rules? The question "What's making it difficult for you to get what you Want?" helped creating guest stars.<br/><br/>- I've discovered that wanting ordinary things like going out with the dog or have a quiet time alone are more fun than crazy goals like starting a nuclear plant or bending time and space.<br/><br/>- There should be a jingle to start the session with. Suggestions came up to have different jingles for starting Star and Family scenes.<br/><br/>- As Rasmus already said, we tried the rule that the one who got the most cards wasn't allowed to knock. Me and another player didn't like the rule at all because we both got two cards very quickly, which meant that we had to sit and watch the rest of the game without being able to knock. As I said before, it could be fixed by having a rule that you must give the black card away if you are one of the ones who go the most cards.<br/><br/>_____________________________________<br/>This is the family tree after two sessions<br/>\xad\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf\xaf<br/>Alex Jones (17 years old): methlab, cool, been to rehab.<br/><br/>Baby (27 years old): addicted to drugs.<br/><br/>Jamie Jones (12): stalked by the math teacher.
