You can find the feed <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/canonpuncture" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>* The Puncturists discuss a recent experiment we did where we played a mash up: taking the Shadowrun setting and runnning it with Mortal Coil (hence the name Shadowcoil).<br/>* I interview Kevin Allen Jr about Sweet Agatha (it's from Gencon).  I apologize for the audio quality in advance, but I felt compelled to share the interview with others.  I'm very excited about Sweet Agatha and Kevin Allen Jr. is a great interviewee.<br/><br/>This is the first episode in our Grand Experiment.  We're releasing four episodes this month (one a week). I'd appreciate it if y'all could listen and participate in the poll we'll have at the end of the month regarding these four episodes.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
