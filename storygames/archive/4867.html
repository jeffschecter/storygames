I guess for me the thing that makes the setting so compelling is the way the fantastic is made mundane.  The world is full of these incredible wonders, who have to go and get jobs and pay the rent.  It's a world where the rules are weird and arcane, but consistent and observable.  I think it would be a mammoth project, but making a D&amp;D mod for the setting seems like the best way to achieve something approaching that.  D&amp;D has the familiarity, but also the bizarreness, to carry that off.  It's got the same feeling of rules that make absolutely no sense, but fit together into a cohesive system.  It would feel right to me to be considering the properties of Scabmettler blood to decide if it provides damage reduction or an AC bonus, or to be figuring out the Will save required to resist a Slake Moth.  It's the kind of world where even the most wonderous, other-worldly beings have mundane concerns, where enough physical force can overcome almost any metaphysical threat.  I think that's what the author's comments in Dragon boiled down to, that he liked D&amp;D for the rigid categorization of the fantastical, for the dissection of wonder into coherant stat blocks.  <br/><br/>Of course, the other element of the setting is that around every corner is another unique marvel, completely unexpected and yet an important part of the city's ecosystem.  This is possible in the books, but it seems pretty impossible for a roleplaying game, without some kind of ninja tricks from the GM.  That's assuming, of course, that you use a traditional GM structure to approach the the game.  I think that's a path that leads to madness.  You'd need one of those much-idolized savant GMs, dedicated to reproducing the setting in glorious detail, doing hours of statting up, and also improvising additions to the setting which feel on a par with what's already been created.  It would be an almost impossible task.  I think perhaps a better, saner way to approach it would be as a series of short stories, perhaps with a rotating GM or with shared duties, to limit the amount of work done at any one time.  <br/><br/>I'm not saying that it <i>can't</i> be done with TSoY, and indeed I think you could have a great game like that, albeit subject to the same problems as playing in any setting from a novel or film: That the source material is already telling the story that the setting is built to support.  Interestingly I think this is less of a problem with New Crobizon, and that's probably the greatest weakness of the books, that they're a fantastic setting with kind of irrelevant-seeming stories attached.  PSS felt like a third-party RPG module - a little adventure that didn't seem to build on the vision of the setting that was so evident.  The Scar had the most satisfying storyline, it felt like something that could only happen in New Crobizon, but then kind of didn't go anywhere.  Iron Council was great, and felt like it was going to really make a mark on the setting, only to end, literally, with nothing happening.  It seems like the author is so in love with his setting that he's not prepared to have any significant changes happen.  Just like an RPG setting, all the "metaplot" happens outside the story presented in the book. In that sense, playing D&amp;D in the setting is likely to feel very much like the books - a bunch of events happening in the setting, with no lasting impact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109605/#Comment_109605" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-25T22:59:45+00:00" title="November 25, 2007 10:59PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            TSoY has some neat features that would tie well into a wild fantastic story like Perdido Street Station. However, Mieville's stories tend to deal with huge power differentials (some characters are just about all-powerful, otherless are almost completely impotent) and a strong focus on the theme of powerlessness--how does the individual stand up against powers so much greater than him or herself that they can barely be grasped?<br/><br/>As I understand it, a fundamental aspect of TSoY is that everyone is more or less on even footing. Even the little goblin slave-boy can defeat the great sorcerer--we're all "human", after all. So you might run into problems trying to model that whole gamut of "powerless nobody" to "earth-shaking influence" in TSoY.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109679/#Comment_109679" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-26T12:42:11+00:00" title="November 26, 2007 12:42PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Chris Peterson</cite>plus an artist's rendition that looks nothing like<i>I</i>imagined a slake-moth to look like..</blockquote>Yeah. Isn't the SLake-moth describes as being somewhat more ... human-like looking? It's been a bit since I read PSS but I think I remember something like a human-like face with the feelers/antennas for eyes or something.<br/>Could be wrong though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
