A couple of Where The Heart Is playtesters commented that it's difficult to get people to play games verging on real life as they roleplay in order to <i>escape </i>from RL. My current solution for the game in general is to produce playsets set in a future far enough away that it doesn't <i>seem </i>like real life, and ones that draw on a specific setting, forex Downtown Abbey (masters and servants) or war settings (officers and men) etc. In terms of the standard game I encourage players to pick characters as unlike themselves as possible. <br/></blockquote>\nAnd here\u2019s a reply, again taken from the other thread:\n<blockquote>I think it might be an acquired taste? Many players might not be used to rpgs dealing with real-life issues, and prefer escapist fun when they game. Which is totally cool. I mean, I can totally relate to that. I\u2019ve played a bunch of these Nordic style larps and freeforms dealing with heavy subjects, but sometimes they\u2019re just not my cup of tea and I\u2019d rather just play a silly soap opera game or Shadowrun or something. I like the variation. So it can be a hard sell, even to me who has both experience with such games and am currently designing in this tradition, right? You can, as you say, deal with contemporary RL issues through the lens of sci-fi or history or fantasy. You can also attack it head on. I mean, movies, books and theatre have all these different genres and approaches. Some are fantastical; some are more down to earth. Why shouldn\u2019t the same variation be possible with rpgs?<br/><br/>I agree that role playing games are a good, interesting and valid approach to exploring lots of issues and subjects. And one which might give different perspectives and experiences than, say, literature, movies and plays.</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416076/#Comment_416076" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-12T08:03:49+00:00" title="June 12, 2013  8:03AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2013 8:04AM by David Artman.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18477/the-curse-a-freeform-game-about-hereditary-breast-cancer" rel="nofollow">story-games.com/forums/discussion/18477/the-curse-a-freeform-game-about-hereditary-breast-cancer<br/></a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416077/#Comment_416077" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-12T08:12:32+00:00" title="June 12, 2013  8:12AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2013 8:13AM by catty_big.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the link, but I'm not thinking so much about purely autobiographical games as ones that deal with RL issues in a very general sense.

Some people secretly want to try it but are nervous (so you have to nurture them a bit more) and some people like their narrative distance from real life, and there's pretty much nothing you can do to get them into a style of game that doesn't suit their desires.<br/><br/>One question, I think, is what do you mean by "games that address RL issues"? Do you mean some of the more naturalistic  Nordic freeform games, which often take place in the mundane world and deal with real-people drama? or do you mean a Cthulhu Dark scenario aimed at addressing the ravages of colonialism in India? Because I think that the angles are different depending on the end goal.<br/><br/>I've had some success getting people into Nordic freeform here on the east coast, so I can speak to that angle. One of the nice things about these semi-live games is that they are pretty accessible because they don't involve a lot of rules (lowers the barrier to entry for many people), and for me at least, they lessen the idea that I need to play a character, which lowers the social awkwardness for me. They also don't require much in the way of costuming, set, or prep.<br/><br/>My tack on introducing freeform to folks is:<br/><br/>a) explaining the style of game and how it differs from other roleplaying games people may have played.<br/>b) explaining why someone might want to play this style of game. (self-discovery, to feel strong emotions, etc etc)<br/>c) taking no for an answer. You want to encourage people to try new stuff, but if people aren't up for these sorts of games, they shouldn't be playing them.<br/>d) create a supportive atmosphere at the game session and afterward. (Read: always have a debrief)_<br/>e) choose games good for people new to the play style.<br/><br/>These sorts of games have slowly found a following on my local convention scene. First time around, I put four games on the schedule and I think three of them ran, with a few people who showed up more than once. Second convention, five games, and four of them ran, including some repeaters from the first convention...over time you build up a base of people interested in this sort of gaming. This has translated over into similar games not run at conventions, like Mad About the Boy, or more recently, Limbo.<br/><br/>Does this help at all? I guess what I'm saying is, "start doing it, and eventually people will come." It might take a moment, but these gamers are out there. I'd say there's a whole subset of gamers who grew up on pure adventure stuff but got hooked on the emotion who are ripe for the crossover. But I think there's also a whole set of non-gamers who are or might be interested in this sort of thing. In my experience, it has taken a while to find a crew of folks interested in this sort of thing, but they're out there, just waiting for you to bring the RL drama!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416080/#Comment_416080" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-12T08:26:50+00:00" title="June 12, 2013  8:26AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lizzie as a good point about the breadth of what can be meant by "real life issues."

My playtest of WtHi at a con in London last December filled with three people who <i>specifically</i> wanted to play the game, and one who admitted to being a D&amp;D player (he was the one who commented during a break that it was too close to real life, although he remarked later, after he\u2019d been in a particularly poignant scene, that he could see it growing on him).\n<blockquote>One question, I think, is what do you mean by "games that address RL issues"?

The three playtests of WtHi that I\u2019ve facilitated so far (the low number speaking to the hardness of the sell I feel) have included themes such as under-age drug-taking, two families being driven apart by the radically differing parenting styles of two brothers and their respective families, a young boy visiting his father in prison, and the problems inherent in managing families with atypical models (which is the main point of the game).  \n<blockquote>My tack on introducing freeform to folks is:<br/><br/><b>a) explaining the style of game and how it differs from other roleplaying games people may have played.<br/>b) explaining why someone might want to play this style of game.

I usually find that a lot of people, once they start playing, begin to appreciate the positives of this approach, but as I say, it\u2019s difficult to get them to the table in the first place. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416082/#Comment_416082" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-12T08:38:23+00:00" title="June 12, 2013  8:38AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Does this help at all?

The lack of exposure is IMO the biggest problem we face- as an example, when we ran IGoD at UK Games Expo last month we had a lot of players saying they didn't knew such games existed.

But lots of people have faced some sort of pressure to assimilate with a superior societal force, so that's what Dog Eat Dog is about. If you make the issue larger, people can relate it more easily to the problems in their own life. At the same time, by making it a little more general, you have less of those immediate collisions you're talking about where your game is about a specific life issue somebody is currently dealing with.<br/><br/>The other thing that helps is letting people provide their own distancing. Colonialism is a very stressful topic for many people, so they sometimes want a little space. Dog Eat Dog allows you to define your own statements about the setting. I've seen a lot of Dog Eat Dog games with more or less silly or fantastic setting elements, because then it's a little less threatening. But even if you have jetpacks or super powers, the core mechanics still work to provide pressure, so you still get the experience the game is meant to create.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark" title="lizziestark"><img alt="lizziestark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lizziestark">lizziestark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416111/#Comment_416111" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-12T15:17:43+00:00" title="June 12, 2013  3:17PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just want to offer a different perspective on the idea that games about sensitive subjects are more uncomfortable to roleplay.

When I play fantasy/quest/adventure-type games (I try not to, but at my club there\u2019s nothing else on offer most of the time), I always ask in advance how \u2018n00b-friendly\u2019 they are, i.e. do I need to know an immense amount of backstory, do I need to have been playing the game since I was 13, do I need to be constantly working out how to use my ream of character sheet etc., whereas with RL-based games, as you say, all that is obviated.<br/><br/>So yes, easier to play in some senses, but I\u2019m not sure about more comfortable: unless you manage to distance the player from the character, especially if there\u2019s a high-emotion issue such as the ones I mentioned above (teen pregnancy etc.) the risk is that the player is having that going on in their own life and <i>might</i> feel awkward or uncomfortable roleplaying it. I say <i>might</i>, equally they might relish the opportunity to deal with such an issue through roleplaying- like the way people are often encouraged to do in therapy- precisely <i>because</i> there's a distancing, i.e. it\u2019s \u2018only a game\u2019, it\u2019s \u2018not real\u2019.  \n<blockquote>I also want to make the point that it's possible to access the universal through the specific -- this is what most journalistic ledes are based on.

I have another comment about this section, but wait a minute\u2026\n<blockquote>What if I don't make the character of this kid too specific, but give you a sense of some of the dynamics?

A lot of trad games have acres of character background, backstory, personality, motivations, flaws, objectives and beliefs etc., in fact in some ways they\u2019re not so different from player-genned story game characters. With your Half-Filipino kid in Hawaii, would you leave it at that, and let the player fill in everything else, or would you add some backstory, forex his parents have recently got divorced, he\u2019s experienced racial bullying in his previous school, his teacher suspects he\u2019s self-harming, he reacts badly to authority figures etc.?  \n<blockquote>WtHI looks interesting. </blockquote>\nThanks! The playtests so far have all generated interesting stories, and all sorts of high-emotion issues have come out. What's good about it I think is the fact that, apart from character gen, where players build the gameworld, set the problems the family has to deal with (in the form of themes, goals and character objectives etc.) and create the PCs as a group, the game could literally go anywhere. However, unless you\u2019re happy with bleed (and, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I get the impression that Nordic freeform games positively encourage it) there is obviously a risk that issues arise which might prove uncomfortable for one or more of the players for the reasons alluded to above. The question then is, how to deal with bleed, if/when it occurs? <br/><br/>There are three methods that I\u2019m currently aware of: 1) having an L&amp;V discussion pre-game- generally accepted in the UK nowadays as being more harmful than beneficial, because players are being asked to be upfront and open about the topics that make them uncomfortable; 2) the X/O card- useful because with it players can not only opt to have less of a particular topic (X) but also <i>more</i> of it (O), and 3) the palette in Microscope. In a game I facilitated at UK Games Expo, in which we mapped out and roleplayed the rise and fall of the British Solar Empire from the late 1890s to the 1970s, we had MUST HAVE integration and mixing of Human and non-Human races, and MUSTN\u2019T HAVE deliberate genocide. Finally, 4) allowing any player to call a halt to the game if they feel uncomfortable, without having to say why or about what. Interestingly, during a discussion on this topic after the Microscope game one of the players suggested simply scheduling lots of breaks as a way of defusing possible tension. Simple but effective!  <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416287/#Comment_416287" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-14T10:42:14+00:00" title="June 14, 2013 10:42AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my mind, sometimes games about real-life issues are just like watching a serious or sad movie rather than Transformers 3 or whatever. People have all sorts of tastes in media and sometimes you want something that's not based on genre fiction. Still, I think a lot of folks in the indie tabletop community do both: they have their serious, gripping content in a genre-fiction game. Certainly, I've never played a campaign of Mouse Guard or Bliss Stage or Apocalypse World that wasn't emotionally harrowing and tough. Just because you're playing a dungeon crawl doesn't mean that it's all escapist fantasy, right? Like Ben, I think supposedly "realistic" games sometimes portray a highly exaggerated version of humanity that's much less real than many sessions of Monsterhearts. So naturalism is definitely an interesting thing, but it's not always synonymous with handing real-life issues in a mature or serious fashion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416307/#Comment_416307" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-14T14:37:40+00:00" title="June 14, 2013  2:37PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2013 2:39PM by catty_big.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Just because you're playing a dungeon crawl doesn't mean that it's all escapist fantasy, right?

Real life issues often come more from the 'unreal' than the ostensibly real, in terms of game setting etc. Forex, I played in an extremely tense Warhammer Witch hack last year, where in the final scene we were all standing on the deck of an Inquisitorial ship carrying an exterminatus weapon, debating whether a) not to deploy, thereby saving the 80 billion souls on a planet that had been overrun with a heresy, or b) blast the planet to smithereens and save the several trillion souls of the wider Imperium. Pure fantasy, huh? Not real, right? Oh no, to us, in those final minutes, since we had all been roleplaying our socks off and had got really immersed in our characters, it had become very real indeed, and we all agonised over the decision. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dr_goth_mh" title="dr_goth_mh"><img alt="dr_goth_mh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dr_goth_mh">dr_goth_mh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418290/#Comment_418290" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-13T21:04:43+00:00" title="July 13, 2013  9:04PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part of it, as others have said, is make it clear what the game is about.  Whether it's escapist fantasy, high level treatment of an issue or very focussed experiences on personal level of something players generally want to know thetype of game they are getting into. <br/><br/>An important issue, in termsof design, is the rationale.  Why is there some reason to deal with this topic in the next few hours?  If you are looking at personal issues (some mentioend above were racism, drug abuse, job loss) in real life years will go by with all that happens is that the problems simmer away. Why is something interesting from a play experience point of view going to happen in the next few hours? Unless you, as designer, are look for a "slice-of-life" experience you need to think about what the motivation is for the players to activel explore these issues.  they might just do it, as they are players, but without an in-game motivation the overall effect can be artificial.<br/><br/>I'm not saying anything too deep here, clarity and motivation are very basic building blocks,  but they are worth bearing in mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
