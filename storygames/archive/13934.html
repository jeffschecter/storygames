With both groups the rest scenes were not satisfying since they felt defused from their very start.<br/><br/>You choose to initiate a rest scene when you want to remove four dice of heat from the dice tower. To play the rest scene you have to frame a scene were you are putting your character flaw under the spotlight, then the other players have to convince your character to change, if your character accept to change you remove his or her flaw. Your character take a harm, you remove the four dices of heat and you change your character flaw for a new one.<br/><br/>But each time we played one of those scene, they felt defused since when you initiate a rest scene you are already ok with taking a harm to reduce the heat. You already made your choice and you are doing it on your own terms since you are the one framing the scene. We dint feel really engaged or challenged by our character flaw during those scenes because when framing ourselves our rest scene, we kind of already know how our flaw will be challenged. <br/><br/>But after our last session, I was reading back the free PDF version of HfL. And in this version when you initiate a rest scene you have to frame a scene were you put the focus on the flaw of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a other</span> character and you have to try to convince this character to change. This old version of the rules seem more interesting, I wonder why it was changed. In this version when you frame the scene you don't already know if the other character will remove his or her flaw and accept to take a harm. Also the character under the spotlight seem more challenged since he dint frame up the scene, now there is a element of unknown for him or her. And sometime considering your harm level, you can even get caught to make a hard decision: take a other harm or remove 4 dices of heat?? Ouch!<br/><br/>But I still wonder how to make the rest scenes rocks as they are written in the actual (printed) version of HfL.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316447/#Comment_316447" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-13T06:11:46+00:00" title="March 13, 2011  6:11AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 13, 2011 6:16AM by Sebastian.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Cedric,<br/><br/>Sorry for not getting back to you sooner. I've just relocated to another country and it took a while to get internet access.<br/><br/>Rest Scenes work differently from the rest of the game. Points of tension are obvious in Run Scenes\u2014do I knock over the dice, does my character die? If you go into a Rest Scene looking for that kind of tension, you will be disappointed. Rest Scenes are intentionally malleable. As a player, a Rest Scene gives you a chance to control the outcome of the scene and to throw the spotlight on your character. It grants narrative authority and, in the ways that you've described, totally removes the "do I/don't I" question.<br/><br/>When I run a Rest Scene, I use it as an opportunity to show my character's weakness. I set up a scene in which my character is about to succumb to that weakness and, without any fixed outcome in mind, I leave the scene open for another character to enter. At this moment, I'm not sure what is going to be the significant factor that changes my character's perspective, but I know it's going to be something originating from another player. The tension and excitement comes from the collision of two creative vectors.<br/><br/>For example, we ran a game in which one character was lazy. In fact, he was a narcoleptic demolitions expert. Ha ha ha, and so on. It was a little gonzo, but everyone was laughing and enjoying themselves, and I love when people do that. He pulled a Rest Scene, so he set himself up in a scene, diffusing a bomb. It went a bit like this*:<br/><br/><b>Narcoleptic Demo guy</b>: I'm diffusing a bomb.<br/><b>Gripe guy (played by another player)</b>: Let's say I'm helping him with the bomb.<br/><b>Narcoleptic Demo guy</b>: "Any chance you could hold this here while I get my tools?" I pass him a tiny wire, walk off and collapse, asleep.<br/><br/>BAM! Now, what's going to happen? The Demo guy saw this coming, but he didn't know how it was going to be resolved. The Gripe guy had to react to the situation. He described his character waiting, helpless and sweating with tension. Minutes later, the Demo guy gets up, fixes it, and they have a row.<br/><br/><b>Gripe guy</b>: "You've got to stay on the meds, man!" I toss him a bottle of pills.<br/><b>Narcoleptic Demo guy</b>: "... But..." Hesitantly I take the pills. (Out of character) Okay, I'm going to change my Flaw from Narcoleptic to... Sociopathic. There's a reason I don't take my meds!<br/><br/>So, in short, let the tension come from the collision of two vectors, (1) the setting up of the Flaw by the active player and (2) the reaction to that vector by the other. Also, relish the chance to switch your Flaw. <b>Changes inform.</b> If I could offer you a checklist:<br/><br/><b>1.</b> Set up your character so he's really fucking up someone's shit. Really, really, really.<br/><b>2.</b> Use that as a stage to push another player into action.<br/><b>3.</b> When it comes time to change your Flaw, that's when to throw the curve ball.<br/><br/>Additionally, make sure your Flaws and Gripes match! Every player should have a motive to compete with someone else. If your Gripes don't stem from Flaws, that can lead things astray. Check out the War of the Bard scenario for examples of good Gripes.<br/><br/>Lastly, use Rest Scenes to take a break from chance and skill. The control you get over the narrative and the shaping of the scene can be helpful in pacing the game and pacing your creative rhythm. And, even if they fall flat, they still help give the group a break. A change is as good as a rest!<br/><br/><i>*Actually, it didn't go exactly like this.

(since we desire this outcome from the start of the scene because we want to reduce the heat). I get that interaction between the characters should be fun, but those scenes are kind of weird to roleplay since we try to convince someone to change his flaw, but we all know that the player already want to change his character flaw since he want to reduce the heat. <br/><br/>I am curious, why do you prefer your current version of the rules instead of the old version were the player initiating the rest scene frame it to put the focus on the flaw on a other character? <br/><br/>I am still asking questions, but I appreciate your answer. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I am printing it to think about it when we will play the game again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317157/#Comment_317157" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-19T05:33:30+00:00" title="March 19, 2011  5:33AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2011 5:36AM by Sebastian.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>So why not just narrate a scene were our character change it flaw for a other one?</blockquote>\nThat's what Rest Scenes are, for me. The scene setup\u2014you choose the location and I jump in with my character\u2014informs that change.<br/><br/>To be honest, I think the game text is problematic. I'd prefer Rest Scenes to be understood differently. I'd prefer if we used them to discover how to change our character's flaw, not whether or not we changed it. In retrospect, I should have taken out the do-not-change-your-flaw option from Rest Scenes. I can see why that's bothersome. Sorry about that. You've highlighted it and I appreciate your candour.<br/><br/>Background: During playtesting, I found that players rarely, if ever, opted to change their Flaw when pressured by another party. Once I realised this, I felt that I needed to strip out the rule or modify it. By allowing players to decide when they were changing their own Flaw, the situation reversed. Now players were <i>always</i> changing their Flaw in order to reduce the Heat. This meant that characters were changing in blunt, violent ways (akin to the grind-house genre) and, mechanically, making an interesting heat vs. trauma decision. The new system encouraged more frequent Rest Scenes, which made my game sessions more fun.<br/><br/> I think there might be a cool way to discover Rest Scenes during play, if you're keen to try something new:<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Escape</b></span><br/><br/>1. Strip out the Rest Scene option.<br/>2. At <b>any time</b>, a player can trigger an <b>Escape</b>:<br/><i>....a. Player takes a Trauma,<br/>....b. Player changes his Flaw,<br/>....c. Reduce Heat by 4,<br/>....d. End the Run Scene.</i><br/><br/>This offers players an organic martyr system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
