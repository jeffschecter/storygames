We're currently playing Dresden Files and are about 3.5 sessions in (our last session was short, only 3 scenes). The first two sessions were really rough, but finally in the middle of the third session things finally clicked and the story really started to flow really well. Unfortunately, what made things click was largely us deciding to avoid the system. (And I don't think it's the angle of playing over Skype - we've played a wide variety of stuff, including moderate-to-high crunch games like TSoY and Dogs over Skype and had success with them.)<br/><br/>Now to be fair, the problem that we have is mostly with the magic system and not with FATE itself. (The stuff like skills and compels are really elegant and we have no beef with that.) First of all, the fact that there are TWO magic systems is just problematic. The magic system for the cantrip-like evocation spells is really great and we've had no trouble using that. But the system for rituals using thaumaturgy is just awful and none of us can figure out how to make it go. The rules are completely impenetrable and don't give you instructions for what you're supposed to do. <br/><br/>For instance, when you're gathering power for a ritual, the GM is supposed to determine how many shifts the preparations would get you - but the text doesn't provide clear instruction for how to do that. Neither does it provide clear instruction for how to properly determine the difficulty of a ritual. So when we had this big ritual that we'd spent three sessions building up to, the GM wound up basically arbitrarily picking some numbers based on our descriptions for the ritual and how hard he thought it should be rather than even trying to use the system - since every time we had done that previous gameplay just bogged down and got really un-fun for me - the lone non-caster in the group.<br/><br/>The frustrating thing is that the dynamics of our group means that we just keep running into this over and over again since one character is a wizard and another is a Lovecraftian cultist - both of whom rely heavily on ritual both mechanically and fiction-wise. And those of us who have played even a little Spirit of the Century are frustrated because the Dresden Files just doesn't seem as elegant an implementation of the FATE system as SotC. So I'm curious to hear from other people who have played the DFRPG. Have you had problems with the magic system? (Have you used the magic system at all?) Were there parts of the system that you just wound up avoiding?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305701/#Comment_305701" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T09:03:02+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  9:03AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have not played yet, but I've got eyes on this thread, as after the WFRP3e game we're going to dive into a series of Dresden Files games...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305729/#Comment_305729" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T11:09:18+00:00" title="December 23, 2010 11:09AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anna,<br/><br/>So I've run two full scenarios for Dresden Files, across six sessions.  Here's the thing that becomes really useful to keep in mind:  In general, the magic is never going to fail.  So success/failure is not what your rolling.  What you're rolling for is timing, degree of personal cost, and level of effect if it's actually targeted at someone.  When none of these things matter its not worth rolling.  This isn't "cheating" or ignoring the rules because without those three a thaumaturgist can simply attempt to control the spell 1 shift at time.  With a Discipline of 5 there is zero risk at a Discipline of 4 the risk is so minuscule that it probably still isn't worth it.<br/><br/>So, for example, I have a player who likes to summon up ghosts for information.  Assuming he isn't looking for anything super rare or complicated, it just happens.<br/><br/>Now, for the times when it matters, I agree with you that setting the "Complexity" value is a nightmare.  I hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it.  Unless there's some super firm guideline (like when you need to use up all of a targets stress and consequences) I tend to just go with 16 (two times legendary).  It's an arbitrary number but seems to work fairly well.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305741/#Comment_305741" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T11:43:01+00:00" title="December 23, 2010 11:43AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anna,<br/>\n  I have GM'd this in two separate campaigns and played in one.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo boil down the procedure do this:<br/>\n1) GM sets overall difficulty. This value is pretty arbitrary. Generally, if you know what the caster's Conviction is, then you are really just saying, how long will it take to cast this spell. I typically set it between 10 and 16 depending on what the player is trying to accomplish.<br/>\n2) The player grubs for aspects<br/>\n3) The player picks a power level for this round of casting (This number has to be equal to or less than their Conviction).<br/>\n4) The player rolls and adds Lore.<br/>\n5) If the result is equal to or higher than their power level they picked, then you accumulate those points towards their difficulty/complexity that the GM set in step one. If not, it blows back, just like Evocation.<br/>\n6) Does the player have enough power built up? If not, go back to step 3<br/>\n7) You are done! Magic accomplished.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So, the gaff is, if the player is conservative and picks 1 or 2 for the power level to accumulate each round, they are almost guaranteed to succeed.<br/>\n  There are a couple of balance tools that the GM can employ if they feel that this is boring or being exploited..<br/>\n1) Let the other players do cool stuff while the Thaumaturgist is casting. If the whole group really doesn't care about the casting, this is reasonable and a consequence of casting spells for a long time.<br/>\n2) Have something come up and interrupt the casting. The trick is, the entire accumulated power becomes blowback if the thaumaturgy gets interrupted. I mean, you want to present a potential interruption, so that the players canmake a meaningful decision on how to deal with the interloper, but this is a great tool to use, if the PCs are all hanging around the caster while they do their thing.<br/>\n  Both of these are pretty serious, so don't do this unless it is fun for the whole group (including the Thaumaturgist).<br/>\n<br/>\n  I struggled with Thaumaturgy at first too. The issue for me was all the write ups reference Evocation and I still didn't have a solid handle on that. And I wasn't sure exactly how those mechanics carried across systems. Once I did it wrong a coupe tuimes and did it right eventually, it made more sense and was not too bad on the fun scale.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Good luck on your campaign!<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305777/#Comment_305777" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T14:34:43+00:00" title="December 23, 2010  2:34PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See also <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=13311" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305886/#Comment_305886" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-24T16:20:37+00:00" title="December 24, 2010  4:20PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse:<br/><br/>Okay, so let me flesh out the situation that happened with the ritual here just to explain my point. We were in a situation where failure and success were equally interesting, but failure was way, way, waaaaaaaayyyyy more likely. There were only three of us - a wizard Santero, my pathological liar of an Unseelie fae warrior, and a sort of Lovecraftian cultist who got his power from beyond the Gates. There was this elder god type entity in the Everglades who was starting to break out of its prison that we named That Which Sleeps, and it had been established through play as way, way, waaaaaaay out of our league. Still, circumstance put us in a spot where we had to try to shove it back in its prison before we tried to get help from our higher-ups.<br/><br/>So first off, how do you determine the complex of trying to shove something that belongs outside of reality back where it belongs? Our GM gave up and arbitrarily picked a number, but he was frustrated because he didn't like feeling like he had NO support from the text. I mean, it really doesn't say much about how to determine complexity. Ditto for determining shifts. So, you know, we narrated our stuff and rolled some dice and tried to get to the crazily high total he decided would be necessary. And we wound up making it - just. And of course we took a fuckton of damage. And it was fun, except for the fact that we did not in any way feel supported by the system. So again - HOW do you determine complexity? HOW do you determine shifts? And HOW do you maintain tension when it's possible to manipulate the thaumaturgy system so that you succeed every time with the application of enough time? That just makes things tedious and removes the tension.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305887/#Comment_305887" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-24T16:36:00+00:00" title="December 24, 2010  4:36PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll just note that I'm reading this with interest from a game design viewpoint.

One is a number, that's the target number you're trying to hit when you finally make your roll. So the number of shifts you need is the skill you're rolling for the spell subtracted from the complexity, depending on how lucky you feel with respect to getting -4 to +4 on the dice, yeah?<br/><br/>Your real questions are 1 and 3, how you determine complexity and how you maintain tension.<br/><br/>I'll do the complexity one first, using your Being as an example.<br/><br/>Check out p.263, which tells you the complexity of coercing a magical being is overcoming their Conviction.<br/><br/>So your Beast has some extremely powerful but finite Conviction, say, Legendary, +8.  Therefore to compel it you will need to score at least a +9, plus however long you want the thing to be compelled, it sounds like a few days?  So that's a +12 on the time chart, so total is +21.  Not that tough to figure out? Not sure what the problem is.<br/><br/>Now maintaining tension when the thaumaturgist has unlimited time is impossible, but that's true for burglars burgling, politicians politicking and lovers loving.  That is just not what tension is.  Basically there has to be limited time, bad guys kicking open the door, spouses calling from divorce court, etc. for there to be any tension.  How long did your guy have to prepare this thing before the Beast began to have an effect?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305895">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305895/#Comment_305895" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-24T18:57:38+00:00" title="December 24, 2010  6:57PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 24, 2010 6:58PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>so it's interesting to read how others are filling the holes in the game text.</blockquote>\nIt's also interesting to see what people are perceiving as holes in the game text because of the size of it.
