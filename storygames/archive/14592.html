I'm working with my local gaming Meetup group to plan a once-a-month taste test get-together. It should be a bit like Games on Demand in that I will have three games prepped to play, each with a different flavor, so when people meet I can run something for them. It should give them selection and give them a taste test of games they might not have tried before. If I can get an additional GM we can expand to more games but at first it will be three to pick from.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeeping with the taste test theme I want to rotate through the games that are available each get-together. I don't want to replay the same one over and over. Once a game has been played it will be off the list for a few months before it can be played again.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's everyone think?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice on running games in the GoD tradition?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nVictor                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332244/#Comment_332244" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T09:55:28+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  9:55AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Search the forum for "Indie by Storm" and you'll find my advice for running 4-6 games in a single four-hour slot.

Are you trying to experience new games, even at the expense of great fun? If a game is a blast, and you're all loving it, why cross it off the list?

I'm sure the first couple times I pull this off it will be an experiment in time management as much as facilitating some new games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I may steal and repurpose the term "taste test" for my own nefarious purposes.</blockquote>\nBe my guest. lol\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I've done a fair amount of what you're proposing, though, with my local groups.

I can see how Burning Wheel would be a monster to make characters there. If they were almost set to go and the players could add a couple touches for their personal flair it would be a smoother way to ease them into the game. I don't like front-loading a bunch of potentially new gamers with character creation. I want them in the action immediately.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I also recommend nixing the "off the list for a few months" rule. What purpose does it serve?

Also, some games take a couple sessions to get the full taste.<br/><br/>Victor                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332345/#Comment_332345" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T17:27:30+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  5:27PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You'll find some discussion about how we run the New Zealand version of Games of Demand (the equivalent of what you're talking about), here: <a href="http://gamingknack.blogspot.com/2011/06/secret-plan.html" rel="nofollow">The Secret Plan</a>.<br/><br/>I'd also recommend asking the designers of any of the games you're interested in about whether they have any sales demos they can give you. These can make great jumping-off points if you're a bit pushed for time. For instance, Timothy Kleinert has a great demo for the Mountain Witch that can also act as a starting point for a session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332364">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332364/#Comment_332364" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T19:51:43+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  7:51PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At SGBoston, we ran different games every week for 3+ years.  Ben Robbins does a similar deal in Seattle. Really, you don't need to bring multiple options yourself.  Just get other folks to pitch various games and then play whatever gets people's attention, or (if you have enough people) split up and play multiple games. It starts out slow and small, with just you and your associates, but over time it can spawn its own thing.  Now, Dev, Nathan, and I (the three SGBoston founders) are all no longer in Boston, and SGBoston is doing just fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332365/#Comment_332365" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-29T19:55:52+00:00" title="June 29, 2011  7:55PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, I started designing Geiger Counter because I wanted an indie game that was intended to be a one-shot, specifically for this kind of setup.
