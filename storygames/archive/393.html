                    To put it quite simply, I've been working on a Firefly game. I am dissapointed with the number of stories out there and so set out to write something. I know there are Firefly systems already, even an official one, but I wanted something that actually emulated the feel of the show, with Whedon's relationship driven story.<br/>
<br/>
Enough background. Essentially, I'm having trouble fitting a character such as River into my mechanics. After several unsatisfying attempts, I just decided that she is an abberation and can not be described in the terms that other characters are. <br/>
<br/>
I am left with a feeling of dissatisfaction. It feels like the cheap way out of design. I feel my system should support any story the players want to tell (within the conventions of setting and mood and so on) but I honestly think that part of what made River a big deal in the series is that she Did Not Fit In. But is it okay to just leave it at that? Make the players of the game figure it out themselves?                </div>

<p>I think there are stories that are very hard to tell in a collaborative medium. Like really big crazy surprise endings (that don't make you feel like you just sat through a GM's Grande Plotte?), or perhaps even the climactic end of <em>Serenity</em>. Maybe not impossible, but certainly at least hard to do collaboratively.</p>
<p>River particularly seems a bit like a Plot Device / Plot Magnet (and again, it would be railroady to have such a thing if it wasn't actually a player choice) but another way to look at her is as a living, breathing Kicker. Her coming in consistently destabilizes the status quo that everyone has set up, more or less. (Simon also unstabilizes things, but less so - he beings to pursue helpful relations as the ship's medic and with Kaylee, right? But note that River gets in the way on both counts, preventing him from getting close to Kaylee and also requiring to crew to do risky stuff like the Ariel job.)</p>
<p>So how does that strike you: come up with a groupwise Kicker, whether in the form of a passenger, a friend, or simply that your ship is stolen or something.</p>

                            Here's the thing, though:<br/><br/>The Serenity Game also treats River as an "unplayable plot device".<br/><br/>In Prime Time Adventures, she's as totally playable as any other character.<br/><br/>For me, personally, I'd need a lot of convincing not to use Primetime Adventures to play Serenity (it looks like Steve D is also throwing together a Serenity-style game, I wonder if it's out yet... his "Walk the Line"). What are you going for that games like PTA or Serenity can't handle?                        </div>

                            It seems that River is a pain in the ass for a long time, then suddenly becomes kick ass, then goes back to being a pain in the ass. <br/>
<br/>
You might model this with a mechanic that allows players to "save up" power over games, or "buy" power during games by playing out serious disadvantages. Then they can unleash that power in a furious "spotlight" session or scene.                        </div>

                            River isn't a player character.  River has no agency, makes no addresses of the situation, makes no meaningful decisions.<br/><br/>More to the point, River does not affect the situation without Simon being right there next to her.  Tellingly, you cannot consider River apart from Simon -- but you can consider Simon apart from River.  Think of River as something that goes on Simon's character sheet.  She's "My crazy sister, 10d4" or "Dependent: my crazy sister, -20pts"  In player dynamic terms, the mythical player who created the Simon character was putting out a flag, asking the GM, "I want to participate in plots where I deal with my crazy sister."<br/><br/>(Albert -- sort of, except River can't do <em>anything</em> until her battery is fully charged, and spending session after session being annoying and disruptive only to finally kick some ass in some mystical far-off someday doesn't strike me as a very entertaining play experience... and if somebody else did that in a game I was playing, I would want to hit them -- <em>hard</em>.)                        </div>

<br/>
Anyway, to adress the original point, I don't think it's cheap to make a ruleset that leaves out a character that breaks the rules.  Most RPG's do the same thing, except for PTA. <br/>
<br/>
But PTA breaks the rules, too. It's like the River Tam of RPG's.  I think.                        </div>

                            A couple of things. <br/>
<br/>
First, I didn't really intend on this becoming a 'best system to play firefly with'. My answer to that is always, "One designed specifically for it." And no, the Serenity RPG published by MWP does not count. I have not read the book myself, but descriptions from people I know suggest that it is fairly generic with lots of color tacked on. This leads into my disdain of the wide variety of 'conversions' out there. A properly designed game is going to give its own feel to the game. Frex, Dogs is completely the wrong system to use of you are trying to tell a story like that in Firefly. The characters, for the most part, are not agents of authority wandering around making moral choices for the people living on the planets they visit. <br/>
<br/>
Likewise, PTA is all about emulating the feel of a television show. While Firefly was indeed a TV show, PTA just doesn't seem right for it. I have not read the book, but from my play experiences and discussion this topic with others, PTA seems to be more about TV than the actual story in a show. I don't think the Act structure or the way some characters are more prominent in some episodes as opposed to others is necessarily the feel I want. PTA also seems to lack the relationship-driven conflict that Whedon loves to produce. I'm trying to make sure my game keeps relationships as the primary agency for players to affect the story. I'm also making sure that the Ship plays a big role in the game, on the level of being another Character instead of just backdrop or a plot tool.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it really boils down to what you are looking for in a Firefly game. PTA does not encourage the kind of play I want to see. I'm sure you could drift it far enough that it does, but then one might as well design their own system. Which is exactly what I'm doing.<br/>
<br/>
Second, to the question I was really asking and only Danny K really addressed. My system is meant to produce stories similar to a certain body of work. However, I find that one of the prominent characters in that body of work is not supported by the system. As it happens, this character is an exception anyway, so is it alright to leave my system without a means to adequately describe this character? Essentially, any instance of this type of character in the game would require the players to fudge some of the rules.                        </div>

Ah, but they are.  Mal most definitely has a moral code, and the escalation mechanics in <i>Dogs</i> play well into the modus operandi of the Firefly crew - essentially: <br/><br/>1. Do what we need to survive.<br/>2. Do what is right, but keep our heads down doing it.<br/>3. Do what is right, but get in someone's face.<br/>4. Do what is right, but beat on someone.<br/>5. Do what is right, and start slappin' leather.

The central problem is that River is a Macguffin throughout most of the series, until you get to <i>Objects in Space</i> and the events of the movie (and, ostensibly, in between and after).  You can make a case that she starts to get unMacguffinlike (whatta word!) after <i>Ariel</i>, but that's pushing it.<br/><br/>So ok, she's a Macguffin.  Accept that for a moment, and let it sink in.  She's a plot device, not a character.  The rules you've set up for characters don't really apply to her.  But what you have instead is the fact that almost every episode of <i>Firefly</i> (and most Whedonverse shows) is a Macguffin <i>of some sort</i>.  It's the Monster of the Week, the art piece that Joyce brings home, the girl who stumbles in off the street on <i>Angel</i>.  Macguffins EVERYWHERE.<br/><br/>So what you need for your system is a means for he characters to form relationships, if not to each and every Macguffin, at least to <i>classes of Macguffins which strongly interact with their personal issues</i>.  For example, wossname, the old army buddy from <i>The Message</i>, is a Macguffin.  He's not a character, he's a plot device to explore Mal and Zoe, and their baggage left over from the war.  Will they do anything to help this guy, because of their history and what he represents (the remnants of Mal's unit and by proxy his failures in the war), or does he side with his new crew?<br/><br/>So in your game, you need a means of generating Macguffins, linking those Macguffins with the heart-strings of your characters, and then using that mesh to move the plot along, by creating knots of situation.<br/><br/>But what about River?  Well, she's still a Macguffin, but she's a special kind of Macguffin - something that each and every Whedonverse season has as well - she's the link to the Big Bad for the season.  Granted - we don't get to know much about the Big Bad, even in the movie, because Joss changed up Big Bads on us.  But she's a Macguffin who's directly tied not only to the Big Bad, but the overall theme - River symbolizes what happens when the Alliance keeps fucking with you.  <br/><br/>She's the apotheosis of what Mal (and Zoe, one would suppose) hate about the Alliance.  Jayne just wants to make sure she doesn't get him killed, but otherwise he doesn't care one way or the other about her.  To Simon, she's a total betrayal - his former life was inside the Alliance, after all - and she represents the indifference that system has to its own inhabitants.  I think to Book she represents a ghost of the past he's running from as well, but then again I have my own theories about Book, who was a mystery to the bitter end.  Inara and River don't mingle much during the show - there's a weak connection there - but she's still an Alliance insider.  River could represent the threat of ostracism.  Without the Guild, Inara's just a well-trained hooker.  And finally, Kaylee just wants to be friends - she sees River as a person, not as a Macguffin at all.<br/><br/>So that's what your <i>Firefly</i> game needs - a means to generate Macguffins, both episodic and seasonal, and tie them into the relationship map game mechanics.  Because River isn't an anomaly in terms of the Whedonverse.  She's one of a class of individuals/objects - and even then she's not original.  <br/><br/>Dawn is the prototypical character-as-Macguffin of the Whedonverse, although you can make cases for Riley &amp; Faith, previously to that.<br/><br/>Now this doesn't mean that a Macguffin can't be a character - in fact, most of the Whedonverse Macguffins become characters in their own right.  Hell, you can make the case that Angel is the Macguffin of Season 2 <i>Buffy</i>, and he got his own freakin' show.  If you think about it, just about every <i>clearly</i> Macguffin character (Fred, Dawn &amp; Kennedy - if you accept Kennedy as a proxy for the Slayerettes) gains characterhood after a while, and a clear role in the narrative (science-side geek, Junior Watcher and ... well ... unknown because there's no Season 8 Buffy).<br/><br/>But that happens <i>after</i> their Macguffinhood is revoked by resolution of the situation that they represent.  After that, they just become characters.  And if what bothers you about that is that you'd have a superninja PC/NPC walking around that you can't model in your system, well, we don't know that for sure, do we?  Maybe after the events of the movie, along with the terror and general gibbering nonsense, she loses a lot of her ninja powers as well, as they're subsumed.  She's still hella smart - but then she'd fill that function in the team, which, frankly, could use some actual brains in the operation.                        </div>

<p>Josh, to this original point: I'll agree with you that a system that doesn't help you with this important part is pretty much cheating you out of the game you actually wanted to play. The <em>Firefly</em> game needs to allow for Mal kicking a dude into a engine fan, and if that's not possible then we have a real problem, y'know? You're totally right here.</p>
<p>I think a question relative to Firefly is one about all conversions: which parts of that story are most important to carry over? Is the existence of a River-like character central to your vision of Firefly? Or is it more important to simply have strong relationships amongst a crew, or rules for kciking people into engines? I think there are lots of valid <em>Firefly</em> stories that don't have a River-like role in them. You definitely want her aspect in your <em>Firefly</em> stories, so we gotta find a system that'll actually account for that.</p>

I don't even know where to begin with this.

                            Great stuff.  You could totally build a whole RPG around this concept.  It cries out for a rock-solid mechanic for creating effective Macguffins, I think.  <br>

Your whole post was spot on (excepting the Dogs bit), but this is the most pertinent part. My reply to this is simply, <b>YES</b>. I wasn't really setting out to tell stories with Macguffins but my reason cave before your power of rhetoric. This not only solves the problem I started this thread with, it also contains the added benefit of making my game more awesome.
<blockquote><br/>What do the protagonists do?<br/></blockquote>
I saw my original question as transcending my game plans and so only posted what context I thought was needed to understand it. Had I realized this would be my game's coming out discussion, I would have presented more up front. <br/><br/>The protagonists will be the crew  of a small ship in the edge of the law. They'll pull jobs and maybe have grand adventures. I want to see the relationships between characters be the primary driving force behind the game. So the activity of their relationships is directly proportional to their ability to affect the course of events. I'm emphasizing this to the point that while the characters are probably pulling a job for the coin, the players are pulling the job for Relationship Economy Units. <br/><br/>I also want the Ship to be an important element, so you'll be able to form relationships with it too. It will probably serve as another source of support in conflicts, but you'll have to upkeep it with Relationship Economy Units (which really I may end up calling coin).<br/><br/>Anyway, I've got some other ideas but they are not ready to leave my head just yet. I'll let them swim in the primordial soup a bit longer before I drag them up, gasping upon the beach that is the internet.<br/><br/>EDIT: I forgot to tie one to the other. The Macguffin deal will probably be the primary method for the GM to move the story along, as he can throw it into play and make everyone frantically rework their relationships. I guess then the game plays like this: People toodle along on a few jobs, building up Relationship Economy Units. The GM introduces a Macguffin, which slowly matures, all the while messing with established relationships more and more. Eventually the players can't take it anymore and resolve the Macguffin for good or ill. After that they'll probably have to pull a few more jobs to build up coin again. What they don't quite get is that there is still a Macguffin among them: its just maturing slower!                        </div>

                            I think "what to the protagonists do" is very important, but is secondary to "what do the players do."  Both are important in determining how a game should work.<br/>
<br/>
I do think River is a playable PC, though her player is more interested in throwing problems at other players (not just Simon.  She throws problems at Simon, at Mal, at Inara, at Book.) than at solving problems...which is Just Fine.  I'd far rather play games that support River-players than games that only support Mal-players.<br/>
<br/>
Re the end of Serenity, that feels most to me like a case of lose-to-win powergaming.  I can just see Brian, of "Knights of the Dinner Table", going "ok, time for Simon to take one for the team.  Now with the hindrance points I've been building up throughout the series, plus the extra push I get from simon taking a Major injury, I'm going to finally be able to put my plan into action.  Those Reavers are about to be toast -- Sorry, BA, but that's the rules." (note: this idea is stolen, though I was part of the conversation that sparked it).<br/>
<br/>
Both approaches -- the character whose agency occurs mostly in sparking other narrative rather than resolving it, and who's player is likely also playing other adversity (and note that given that River's issues mostly confront -other- characters, I could see her player also playing the Men in Blue and the pair of black asassins), as well as the character whose impact starts out extremely limited and builds only very slowly over time until it spills over, are fascinating, and I'd love to see a game that could do both at once well (ok, I've love even more to see one that could do this while maintaining immersive ability and not causing my more rules-averse fellow players not to go screaming into the night, but you can't have everything).                        </div>
