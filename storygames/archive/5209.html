(This is relevant while you're in your Target Heart Rate: If it's an unlimited # of rerolls, there's no reason not to simply roll one die each time -- presumably you could also add in an appropriate training die each time as well. But that seems sort of slow and lame; it also means actually failing any given effort is outright impossible as long as the player's willing to deal take the HR hit.)<br/><br/>* If you can push more than once, are you considered to have failed the roll each time? (This is relevant in determining lost dice during risky actions: just the one for failing the first roll, like when you gain Static, or do you lose a die every time you roll and don't succeed?)<br/><br/>I think that's it. I've run the game several times now and it's come out a little different every time, which is awesome (like really great fish-and-chips awesome). But these last couple issues continue to kind of bug me.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>p.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

Agents can send a "ping" but apparently Control can only converse through devices.<br/><br/>Read the "Resolution" section on page 5. "Failure to roll at least 11 causes the Agent to fail the attempted action."<br/>Then the nuanced language later:"The advantage of using a Talent is that it can turn a failed roll into a success (without the Agent needing to roll the dice again)."<br/><br/>So a failed roll is still a failed roll when performing a Risky Action - you lose an attribute point if you don't make that 11. You can still push and maybe succeed the action, but with one fewer die to roll.<br/><br/>Also, you should note that Access rolls made while exceeding Maximum Heart Rate are Risky Actions, so presumably the player gets to choose whether he loses Force or Instinct.<br/><br/>While Jared's assertions that you can't re-roll at your Max HR and pushing isn't failure are interesting, if the game is supposed to work that way, MAYBE HE SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN THAT INTO THE RULES, HUH, JARED?<br/><br/>In conclusion, Monsieur Sorensen is equal to, or greater than, a dirty, filthy liar. You're Static's at 11 or higher, Paul.

That's the whole point of the max heart rate. It's the ceiling of your agent's ability to re-roll (arguably their most important ability in the game is to push a failed roll into a successful roll).<br/><br/>You earn Static (and suffer penalties on a risky action) when you fail. This means you stopped pushing the rolls, or never did in the first place. That's why you'd want to re-roll the dice -- to avoid failure.<br/><br/>And what's this about rolling one die at a time? Target heart rate means you can roll between 0 and infinity dice...but you must do it in one roll of the dice. Only a talent die may be rolled after the fact.<br/><br/>Apes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117640/#Comment_117640" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-03T08:42:27+00:00" title="January  3, 2008  8:42AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jared:<br/><br/>Okay okay okay...that's an important detail: you can only push ONE TIME? That does change things a bit. Would've been nice if that'd been explicit in the rules.<br/><br/>Now, the thing about max HR: I read what you're saying here as, you <i>can</i> make a roll beyond your max HR (otherwise the "risky action" rules make no sense) but you <i>cannot</i> push. Is that correct?<br/><br/>Your description for Static, here, contradicts my reading of your rule that states that an agent earns Static when he fails his <i>first</i> roll when attempting an action. Otherwise I don't see that Static is <i>ever</i> going to accumulate, at least at a pace sufficiently fast to scare the players and/or introduce the cool shit into the story.<br/><br/>My current take is that the rolling rules for each HR range is as follows:<br/><br/>Resting to the bottom of Target: Roll dice = Attribute (+ Talent, optionally). May push once with the same dice (+ Talent, optionally)<br/><br/>Bottom to top of Target: Roll any # of dice (+ Talent, optionally). May push <i>once</i> with any # of dice (+ Talent, optionally)<br/><br/>Top of Target to Max: Roll dice = Attribute (+ Talent, optionally). May push once with the same dice (+ Talent, optionally) -- I believe this is functionally identical to "from resting to target"<br/><br/>Beyond Max: Roll dice = Attribute (+ Talent, optionally). No pushing!

It's the ceiling of your agent's ability to re-roll (arguably their most important ability in the game is to push a failed roll into a successful roll).</blockquote>\n1.<br/>Nowhere do the rules explicitly prevent you from pushing a roll. It is <i>implied</i> by the term "emergency Access roll" on page 7, but the only effect of reaching your Maximum Heart Rate is to make all actions risky. Nowhere does it say you can't push a roll.<br/><br/>2.<br/>If Heart Rate cannot go above Max HR, explain this, on page 7: "Agents making Force or Instinct rolls while <b>at above</b> their Maximum Heart Rate..."<br/><br/>3.<br/>If there is no way to add to your bpm once you reach Max HR, then you can't roll any dice at all. Your first roll adds to your heart rate the same as pushing does, so if Max HR prohibits pushing, it prohibits all rolls. The text does not distinguish between HR additions from initial rolls and pushing.<br/><br/>4.<br/>When you reduce an attribute is certainly vague. Page 30: "Static increases by one point when: an Agent <b>fails their first roll</b> when attempting an action."<br/>Page 7: "Failing a risky action reduces the Agent's Force or Instinct attribute by 1 die."<br/>This suggests you don't fail the action, and lose an attribute point, if you keep pushing and then succeed, which means once you are at your Max HR, you will just push all rolls until you succeed, because the rules don't stop you from pushing.<br/><br/>I interpret this as meaning you suffer an attribute loss for any failed roll on a risky action. My interpretation requires no additional rules.<br/><br/>You interpret this as meaning you only fail if a push does not succeed. This interpretation requires the creation of additional rules related to Max HR, which yo have explained in this thread, but which do not appear in the rules. Until you put these rules in the third attempt, or release an errata of some kind, it's just a "house rule," nothing more.<br/><br/>5.<br/>Award winning?

It's the ceiling of your agent's ability to re-roll (arguably their most important ability in the game is to push a failed roll into a successful roll).</blockquote>\n1. Nowhere do the rules explicitly prevent you from pushing a roll. It is<i>implied</i>by the term "emergency Access roll" on page 7, but the only effect of reaching your Maximum Heart Rate is to make all actions risky. Nowhere does it say you can't push a roll.<br/>Hey Johnstone, I understood Max Heart Rate to literally be the <i>maximum bpm</i> of your character, and therefore it cannot go any higher. To me, Pushing is then no longer an option.<br/><br/>I also think the Meditation Technique becomes more valuable this way as you can get back down from Max HR, even if for just one more chance to Push a roll.<br/><br/>You ask Jared to explain why the bpm cannot go past Maximum Heart Rate by referencing the third paragraph on page 7:<br/><br/><i>"Agents making Force or Instinct rolls while <b>at above</b> their Maximum Heart Rate are always considered to be performing risky actions."</i><br/><br/>I always took the "<b>at above</b>" as another one of the many (not-on-purpose) typos that are found throughout the text. My guess was that it at one point (meant to) read "<b>at <i>or</i> above</b>," then the "or" was dropped, but the "above" was accidentally left behind. What's the point of a Maximum Heart Rate if you can go beyond it?<br/><br/>However, the Lacuna Part 1 first attempt rules specifically describe what happens once bpm goes beyond the Max HR, and therfore contradict my assumptions to a degree. I find no such reference in the second attempt.\n<blockquote><cite>Paul B</cite>If watching gamers cage-fight over rules is part of the "experiment," that's sort of interesting too.</blockquote>\nYes Paul, I'm now thinking this is part of the "Part 2" experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_118029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/118029/#Comment_118029" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-04T18:16:01+00:00" title="January  4, 2008  6:16PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh.

The way I'm playing it, once you go beyond Max HR, there's no point tracking it any more. Sure, it says "Maximum," but it's still just a marker. As you said, in the first attempt, you can go beyond it. I say you can still push, but every roll you fail, you lose an attribute point, so technically, the mechanics are the same - except if you can't push, you have to suffer a failure. Mechanically, a push is just like a second try. Basically, if you can't push, whether you can try again or not is up to the GM.<br/><br/>Also, the way I play it, you still lose an attribute point for failing a risky action when you are well below Max HR. Instead of pushing until you succeed just so you can avoid the attribute loss, even if it puts you way, way up.<br/><br/>My defense for my interpretation (which I figured was correct) is that you have to add less extra stuff to the rules. It's simply a matter of applying attribute loss after a failed risky <b>roll,</b> as opposed to <b>action.</b> It's kinda vague in the rules.<br/><br/>The version you (and Russell, and Jared) propose would need one of two things to be properly "canon":<br/><br/>1. A line that says: "Pushes may not be made at Maximum Heart Rate."<br/>or<br/>2. Your first roll when attempting an action doesn't add to your Heart Rate.<br/><br/>I mean, seriously, guys. I don't understand the reasoning that says you can't roll dice that add to your heart rate, but you can still roll dice that add to your hart rate. If your maximum heart is your maximum, your first roll still adds to your heart rate, so how is it you can roll those dice?<br/><br/>Anyway, I learned to play the game straight from the rules as written. I've never played it with anybody who played it before playing it with me, and the first two or three times we played, I realized I was doing something wrong. Thought I had it all figured out - including the vagueness of promotion (we could try comparing notes on that as well!) - but this thread has shown me that my interpretation is also wrong! and that the game, as written, is actually broken.<br/><br/>So, Jared, if you keep selling the game to strangers without fixing it, I'm not gonna be the only one, am I?

The mission had exceeded 30 static, because static levels in big groups goes totally apeshit. So there was a complete collapse of communication, total chaos, and everyone went scurrying for their own rabbit holes in the hopes that "someone else" had taken care of the mission priorities.<br/><br/>The next-to-last-die thing came up when I had a guy fail a 2D force attempt to get away from a Spiderman. Well, he was down to his last die and had failed to escape, so he's very ominously loaded into a shiny limo with a single Force die and a single Instinct die left to his name. Then I realized one of us would have to pull the trigger.<br/><br/>In that case, I actually had Control pull the plug on him. But that seemed like an incredibly lame copout: If Control can get you out at any time, a) why make Navigation rolls? and b) why fear death? So far, I've been pretty hardcore about the agents needing to establish their own escape routes as a built-in mission priority.

He reads the newspaper. It says the subject has an accomplice, named Henry Wilkinson. Then I pass a note to another player, which says: "Your real name is Henry Wilkinson." Not long after, they meet the subject. He is behind bullet-proof glass, and he holds up a black file folder. Some of the files inside have the agent's pictures on them.

Without that level of investment, death just turns into a video game "guy" counter. Probably worth an up-front chat to get some buy-in from the players first, if they're likely to check-out upon character death. Since death is pretty much in the hands of the players, I say take the gloves off. If they're that skittish about dying, they need to back off and not push their heart rates.
