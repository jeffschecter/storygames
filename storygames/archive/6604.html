The game takes its primary inspiration from the comic Nevermen, as well as many other sources from other comics such as Tom Strong to movies like the Matrix and the music of Danny Elfman. The titular heroes are the shadowy vigilante force that players become who rely (largely) on gadgets and streetwise detective skills. The style of the game is retro-sf (though not outer space) pulp in a flavourful but implied alternate version of a 50\u2019s US city called Tomorrow City. <br/>\nAnyway, the purpose of this post is to discuss ideas for rules. I\u2019ve come up with many ideas for mechanics. Unfortunately none of them excite me. I fully intend to develop my own system and have no desire to use someone else\u2019s or blatantly (important) copy anyone else\u2019s. However the system needs to be \u2018cinematic\u2019, heroic, light and evocative. The characters are heroic in the way Batman is, and mysterious in the manner of the Shadow, so instant death and vastly complicated skill lists are not welcome here.<br/>\nWhat follows then is a basic idea for a resolution system that I invite discussion on. Hopefully it is explained adequately as it\u2019s a little weird. I have been particularly inspired by the ideas behind Don\u2019t Rest Your Head which, although perhaps a bit too rules light, has inspired this approach. You might say the idea behind this was a pulp version of that system, with the dice pools. <br/>\n<br/>\n***<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacters have three main stats which are used to perform actions: Edge, representing training and discipline, Equipment, representing available field gear and special gadgets, and Endurance, inner strength and resolve. Stat scores contribute to actions by building d10 dice pools. Stats average at 3.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen rolling, players always roll their Edge stat as the primary dice pool. They can also choose to add dice, which must be uniquely identifiable, to that from the other two stat pools, up to the relevant stat value. This doesn\u2019t cost anything, and the player can add as many dice as he likes up to the value of each pool. However there are consequences if the player fails the roll and any of these supplementary dice produce tens (though not on Edge dice).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo succeed, the player must roll at least 3 dice no greater than the difficulty number. Three is the average Edge value and difficulties are rated from 1-5. If the character has one (and one only) relevant skill, its value modified the target number in the player\u2019s favour. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the player rolls any tens, each generates 1 point of malfunction or fatigue according to the origin of the dice concerned (equipment and/or endurance respectively). These points then interact with future actions involving those dice unfavourable, though their presence doesn\u2019t oblige the player to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen including dice from either pool in the presence of malfunction/fatigue, one point of either/each \u2013 regardless of the number of dice used from either/each source \u2013 is removed. However if the action then fails, the player suffers further negative consequences, though doing so negates and supersedes the effect of any tens rolled.<br/>\nIf the player fails with more malfunction remaining than fatigue (GM\u2019s choice in the case of a tie between), he cannot use <br/>\n<br/>\nEquipment until he is subject to a repair action or returns to HQ. If there is more fatigue remaining than malfunction then the player is exhausted and suffers damage. These consequences only apply if the failed action involved the relevant dice; thus if only endurance dice were added then apply the effect for having greater fatigue (even if both fatigue and malfunction are tied).<br/>\n<br/>\nProposed skills (for reference and probably subject to change):<br/>\nCommand \u2013 presence and charisma.<br/>\nFists \u2013 melee combat and self defence, armed or otherwise.<br/>\nGear \u2013 skill with engineering, repair and the general application of technology.<br/>\nGuns \u2013 firearm and ranged weapon use.<br/>\nInitiative \u2013 dexterity and physical alertness.<br/>\nMight \u2013 physical conditioning, fitness and endurance.<br/>\nMedic \u2013 the ability to apply first aid and undertake surgery.<br/>\nOperator \u2013 the ability to pilot vehicles of any kind.<br/>\nResolve \u2013 willpower and strength of mind.<br/>\nStudy \u2013 knowledge of intellectual and scientific disciplines.<br/>\nStreetwise \u2013urban savvy and city smarts.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/signoftheserpent" title="signoftheserpent"><img alt="signoftheserpent" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/signoftheserpent">signoftheserpent</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148610/#Comment_148610" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T12:02:05+00:00" title="June  6, 2008 12:02PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2008 12:03PM by signoftheserpent.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No interest at all?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148623/#Comment_148623" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T13:47:28+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  1:47PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This looks interesting.<br/><br/>Have you considered making it a hack to an existing system like FATE or PDQ?

This is why I also dislike generic systems. Rules should reflect the character and style of the setting entirely and that is done best by creating rules for a setting. Plus they're also my rules and so there are no licensing issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also dislike the Fate dice mechnic.

You didn't ask any questions in your first post so I don't know what you want to know.<br/><br/>The system you described sounds like a good solid basis for designing your game around.  Have you tried it out?  If so, what did you like or not like about how it worked?<br/><br/>From reading it, it seems like the main decisions players will make using this system are about "How hard do I push myself?" -- can we take this one more challenge or is it time to head back to base to recharge endurance/equipment?  If we take this one more challenge, how many dice do we throw in and from which of the two options?  (Do I have to decide how many and what type of dice I'm using before I roll any of them?)<br/><br/>Is that the kind of player choice that you feel is relevant to the theme you're trying to create?  What other sort of choices might you want to force players into that would also be relevant?<br/><br/>It's interesting that you site Danny Elfman as an inspiration; I think that's the first time I've heard someone claim a style of music as an inspiration, rather than a book or movie or something else with a story.  But I can totally see how this fits; all I have to do is picture the kind of movie preview that would have a Danny Elfman score playing over it and I immediately know what sort of game it's supposed to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
