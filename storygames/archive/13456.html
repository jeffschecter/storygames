I've always wondered why Praxis wasn't implemented that way, and now I wonder that about this. <br/><br/>So, under the "Discussion filters", imagine three big ticky-boxes.<br/><br/>O - General Discussion.<br/>O - General Design.<br/>O - The Neighborhood.<br/>(And under The Neighborhood would be a bunch of little boxes)<br/><br/>So, normally, the first box would be ticked - and that'd be the forum we have right now.  If you ticked the second, all the Praxis posts would appear.  If you ticked the third, discussions of specific games would appear (and you could turn individual games on and off).  Unticking a box would vanish posts in that category.<br/><br/>Which gives you all the real estate of a place like RPGnet, without the "echoing silence" feel of unused subthingies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

My options seem to come down as follows:\n<ul><li>Don't have a personal forum anymore; no killer, people can discuss things with me at my blog or non-dedicated forums or by email or whatever. The advantage is that there's no work involved, and in truth most of us don't need any sort of dedicated forums for our business or artistic work anyway.</li><li>Wait for somebody else to do something and then ride on their coattails. The advantage is as above, and you don't have to join whatever effort comes up if it's too hipster/American/low-brow or whatever else.</li><li>Start up a new forum with some concept that matches my own needs. Examples include "Forum for myself and any other indie publishers who want a subforum, with some common discussion area", "Forge Europe", "Nordic Haute Couture RPG Forums", "Just like the Forge", "My Webstore Now Has a Forum" and "Bi-Lingual Finnish/English RPG Forum", among others. The advantage is that my own subforum doesn't die on the vine if it's part of an otherwise functional forum community.</li><li>Start up my own forum solely for myself. This is the worst option, I think, as my dedicated audience is an order of magnitude too small to maintain any sort of active community. Dead forums are a waste of time.</li>\n</ul>\nThose are roughly in the order of preference. At the moment I'm leaning towards the first two options, but I guess I could theoretically start up a new forum at some point if I felt like it had a chance to develop into a viable community; I'd be especially interested in something that managed to break new blood and viewpoints into the Forge scene, such as attracting Jim Raggi onto the same forum with myself. No chance of me starting up a Arkenstone-only forum, those small forums with a dozen messages from the owner and no discussion since 2005 are pathetic things.<br/><br/>Joshua makes a good case for cloud-operation aggregation, but there is a big downside to it: what separates a forum community from an aggregated cloud is that the forum member has a priori privileges as regards participation in any discussion that catches his eye; a cloud of blogs and especially forums doesn't achieve the same sort of intensity because people like myself simply won't bother to sign up and log in at some forum just to answer some discussion thread. There are people with different web attitudes, of course, but the friction here would basically make for more cliques and less discussion than an unified forum catches. As an example of the phenomenon, one can consider the fact that it took me three years of observation before I joined the Forge, and I only joined SG in 2008 to cynically market my games.<br/><br/>Story Games supporting publisher-specific sections, especially with some usable filtering options, would be pretty nice - SG is not as good as Forge is in cultural terms (too hipster and nice for me, not enough patriarchal intellectualism), but the crowd is good from a publisher perspective and the general content here is more in line with the typical publisher forum's content already; at the Forge the publisher forums have a noticeably different tone from the rest of the discussion. Don't know if this would be compatible with the SG culture in general, though; might be, especially if the publishers wouldn't moderate their own areas and so on. Ultimately I suspect that this would be pointless, though, considering the structure of the Vanilla forums and the SG culture; there's no actual benefit in categorizing discussions on the basis of game publisher that isn't gained in the current set-up already.<br/><br/>If anybody wants to start up a new forum of publisher/designer-specific subforums, seems reliable as a maintainer and makes the culturally right choices in the forum trade dress and such, I wouldn't be averse to joining that. The Forge system wherein each publisher moderates their own small section is interesting in how it encourages the designer to hang around and be reliable about discussing things with people who play their games. Something like this wouldn't even need to be particularly active as long as there was a large enough line-up of publishers and some reliability to the publishers really following their own sections.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_303480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303480/#Comment_303480" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-06T15:23:30+00:00" title="December  6, 2010  3:23PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be willing to set this up and wrangle the hosting and whatnot for it.

RPGnet is like the mall. It's got a bunch of different shops and venues and tons of people you can meet but going there inevitably means leaving your neighbourhood. <br/><br/>I also agree with the messy layout of the RPGGeek (&amp; Boardgame geek) sites. It's a great database with a lot of activity, but I always get a brain aneurysm just trying to find the right tab to click on to get where I want. Maybe I'm just dumb.<br/><br/>Aggregates are cool, but Joshua is right, I think. An aggregate just collects data, it doesn't necessarily encourage discussion or bring people closer together.<br/><br/>If you just want a page for your game/game company, I think Facebook is actually a pretty great idea. Facebook is inherently a social network, so you're just latching onto it etc. But it's probably not good for finding customers or anything, just established fans. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Burning-Wheel/155436844492750" rel="nofollow">BWHQ</a> recently got a page.<br/><br/>But if Story Games can handle this and expand with something like the aforementioned Goggles, that would be great. Or even if a new, sister site would be put up.

I envision something with an rss feed of Planet Story Games, with an on-site set of forums and then links to off-site forums and blogs. Eppy made the comment the other day that it would be great if there was a small press etsy.

Seems like folks running SMF/Vanilla/whatever could add a web ring embed to their header/footer and find anyone who joined into the "neighborhood."<br/><br/>I also like the idea of an "RSS of everyone's RSS"--kind of like the digg of Indie RPG forums. So any post above a certain threshold (new threads? specific posters? a weird combination thereof) pushes a new RSS item to the aggregator, which is what folks who want the "neighborhood" subscribe to. (Folks who want to "watch a house" subscribe to the particular game's/publisher's forum.)<br/><br/>I'm VERY close to using RSS only for forum watching--clicking into a What's New search on a regular basis isn't very practical for me, anymore, and it's not easy to do on my phone (like using my RSS reader is). Sure, if I want to post, I click through. But it's fast getting to about 80% of threads I ignore... and yet they keep bubbling up into the New Posts views of the forums, if popular. With an RSS feed of new threads (and a fast way to click "RSS for Comments in THIS thread") then I'd probably never visit the "front end" of a forum site again.<br/><br/>Google Me will make all this crap obsolete, by the way. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303602/#Comment_303602" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-07T13:41:34+00:00" title="December  7, 2010  1:41PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds like some folks are describing something similar to <a href="http://www.rpgbloggers.com/" rel="nofollow">RPG Bloggers</a>, but with the addition of a communal forum area.

Anyway, I\u2019ll explain it.  Back after the RPG Theory and GNS forums were closed, there was a lot of talk about creating  new, central community website.  I know Vincent and Clinton were two of the guys who really talked this up.  I want to say NinjaJ had a lot of good ideas too.<br/><br/>Anyway, it went sorta like this.  The front page would be like a newspaper.  There\u2019d be several columns.  In one column would be headlines.  These headlines would be Blog entries.  I think Planet Story Games was started as a result of this idea.  In another column would be Most Recent Posts from the Forge and Story Games and/or maybe a forum hosted on the site. In another column would be peer-reviewed articles written by a small group of designers working together under the umbrella of independent RPG publishing.  I think RPG Theory Review was inspired by this idea.  Finally, at the bottom, would be a store.  I think the Forge Bookshelf or IPR were mentioned as possibilities for this.  The idea was, the Diaspora would be aggregated on this Newspaper site so everyone could still stay in touch.  I think other ideas like a guest book and FindPlay were tossed around too.  Maybe some classifieds for artists and playtesters? <br/><br/>All that\u2019s from pretty foggy memory from five years ago, but I think those desires still remain.  The above is what I\u2019d like to see as a \u201cNeighborhood\u201d for the publishers and fans of indie rpgs.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_303887">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/303887/#Comment_303887" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-10T08:29:23+00:00" title="December 10, 2010  8:29AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>  The front page would be like a newspaper.

To whit:<br/> <br/>You are welcome to contribute to cleaning and decorating and making the place generally better.  However, the decoration can only be of a certain type and never complain if you want to paint the place in any other colour than magnolia.  It's Aldie's place, after all.<br/> <br/>It says it's a community but doesn't seem to allow any sort of diversity or dissent.  I have review a few boardgames there and people got a tad upset a couple of negative ones.  However, these get about 5 times more thumbs than the straight analytical ones. <br/> <br/>The moderating process is utterly opaque - I got banned for calling someone a "see-you-next-Tuesday."  I don't dispute that I should be banned for this.  However, this guy was talking about the profoundly negative effect Gary Gygax had had on gaming in the thread that announced he had died, and about four hours after Gygax had actually died.  The worst thing about the incident that the utterly insensitive and provocative post got pulled.  With the Forge if you're an arsehole it generally stays on there. <br/> <br/>I get tired of being lectured by Texan Christians who have microbadges that say "BGG is a community" and "Christian."  In my experience diversity is essential to prevent a community becoming a horrid little clique.  Instead you get lectured about how it is Aldie's House.  I now use BGG to see what new boardgames are around.  I can get better info on RPGs at places other than rpggeek.<br/> <br/>plus there's too much D&amp;D/Savage Worlds talk for my liking and not a single review of Dogs in the Vineyard.<br/> <br/>I like the distinctiveness and diversity of the indie games world and that you can enter into a thought-provoking discussion.  Wherever people end up I'd like to see those characteristics that made the Forge a wonderful and frustrating experience present also.<br/> <br/>[/rant]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
