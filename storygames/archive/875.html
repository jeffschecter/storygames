<p>I'm in the process of getting a one-sheet together to run tMW at Origins next week and I'm running into the issue where I'm having trouble getting to the point where I'm comfortable with my level of prep.  I want to make sure that the game is about the relationships between the ronin, but I also want to be sure that I'm ready to jump up and keep the action flowing and the imaginations of the players charged.</p>
<p>After reading some quality essays and thread posts on the Forge about the construction of bangs, it occurrs to me that it might be very useful and powerful to come up with three or four NPCs who are already in conflict with one another and who will have need of the ronin for their own ends.  Those motivations would have to be all about getting the players to push their relationships with the other ronin in the game, and not about whatever minor story I author to keep the NPCs in conflict.</p>
<p>I have a bunch of other nifty elements ready to go.  Material I can just pull out and throw at the players to get their fires going.  But I think that a tiny R-Map might be just the oomph I'm looking for.</p>
<p>So, tell me;  Will I break the game or otherwise weaken it with this kind of prep?</p>
<p>-Eric</p>

                            I don't think this will break the game. Of course, you may need to change your R-map during play, because the players have a very strong authorship role in the game, especially by the third act. I'd view the prep as sort of cloud-seeding, giving the players some good particles for their own creative input to coalesce around.                        </div>

                            I second what Brennan says. Be prepared to throw it away as necessary.<br/>

I'd be curious to hear how it works out though. It could be pretty cool.                        </div>

                            Well, here I am at Origins, the morning before my tMW game.  What I did was I created a very simple little relationship map between three NPCs.  I then took that simple little triangle and used it to create a half-dozen bangs.  I figure the simplicity of the r-map should allow me to modify and append as necessary.  With any luck I think I have created something that won't need to be thrown out if the players jump in and get all creative, but rather something that can just be re-attached to the story in different places.<br/>
<br/>
And, if I'm wrong, then it shouldn't be a big deal.  Because at the point where I can't use any of this anymore I figure the players have already created enough material for me to play off of that I just won't need it.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be running it from 1pm to 7pm, and if I have any energy tonight or tomorrow morning I'll let you all know how it went.<br/>

<p>Thanks Jason!</p>
<p>Hey, it occurred to me that I may not get a chance to see any of your feedback on it (we're leaving the hotel at about 9:30), but I thought I might share my two pages of notes for the tMW game.</p>

<p>Disclaimer:  My bang-fu still kinda sucks.  The 'bangs' presented may or may not be actual technical bangs.</p>

<p>Dude.  If my MW game sux'd like that L5R game I'd have to fall on my own sword, spilling my blood all over the table.  But, lucky for me, it was just the opposite.</p>
<p>I got to play with Jess Hammer and two of her crew as well as a dude who heard about tMW through the Forge.  It was a fucking blast.  Easily the best session of tMW evar.  I promised everyone that I would come in and put up an AP post and use my notes to figure out the family tree from that game.  The family tree shaped something like a spiraling bonzai tree.  But, I'm whooped.  My sugar rush is gone and I'm crashing.  Hoping for a better night's sleep tonight than I got last night.</p>
<p>Oh, and the R-Map thing got totally subverted like 30 minutes into play.  Those guys dug their heels right into the game right off the bat and we all went flying.</p>
<p>More later.  Nap now.</p>
