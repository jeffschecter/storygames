I wish I could.<br/><br/>Anyway, last week I ran the Wildlings for five (5) adult players. We played for two solid hours (including character creation). My aim was to get some practice before I run it for kids at <a href="http://schedule.gamestorm.org/sessions/1664" rel="nofollow">Gamestorm</a> in a week. I wanted to do just as much prep as I needed to, and not do any undue hacking or designing (so dealing with Marks was out\u2014I actually thought about them quite a bit, but couldn\u2019t come up with a solution I liked, and I suspected that the game had enough meat as it was. I was right).<br/><br/>I followed the loose \u201cInto the Ruins\u201d scenario, and did a small amount of prep\u2014thinking about things that might happen, obstacles that might exist, interesting people to meet (I\u2019ll write up the extent of my prep when I have it in front of me). I think some of my ideas came from other threads about the game, so if you see familiar stuff, consider me inspired.<br/><br/><i>I started the Wildlings off having just been given their mission to save Rylka, and told to bed down for the night and wait until dawn, when they\u2019d be given their equipment. I don\u2019t know why I did this. I thought it might provide some cool opportunities for \u201cHey, let\u2019s sneak out now and be back before they know it!\u201d Which it did, but it also provided group conflict: half wanted to go, half to stay. They argued. Two people went off and nicked the supplies they needed. The other two still would not go. A compromise wasn\u2019t reached, and I kept looking over the sheets to see if I should make them roll. There didn\u2019t seem to be anything appropriate for settling an argument, so I just let the social rules of the table determine it, which I\u2019m never comfortable with.<br/><br/>In any case, they left the next morning, a little bit before the Wise Women were to come and give them their supplies. Someone made a tracking roll, nailed it, and they were winding their way through the Old Forest, following broken branches and other clues. There was blood on some leaves, and one of the characters tasted it to see if it was human or not (a roll). It was.<br/><br/>I GMed with the skills I learned from Apocalypse World, mostly. They\u2019d made one tracking roll, and were moving through the forest just fine, when it was my turn to speak: ruffling in the bushes. Ice wolves! They made rolls for attacking and for \u201cwhat do I know about these things?\u201d and for sneaking around, jockeying for tactical position. Someone got bit in the leg, someone drew wolf blood, someone figured out these were scrawny and desperate wolves, and someone snuck around the wolf who was biting the first character and beat it away with her axes. Whew! The wolves ran away.<br/><br/>We had another player join in at this point, and it was real easy to have him make his character and run up huffing and puffing to say, \u201cHey guys! Don\u2019t leave me! I\u2026was\u2026chosen to go too! The Wise Women just forgot to tell you!\u201d<br/><br/>Kept tracking through the woods (no new rolls: Let It Ride) until they saw smoke through the trees. Someone shambled up, got a lookout (roll): it was a house.<br/><br/>Turned out to be a woodsman\u2019s house. Everyone was cautious, sneaking around, until someone flubbed their sneaking roll, and the woodsman saw him and called him out. He was amiable, if gruff, and eventually the whole party (minus one very cautious player who remained in the woods) went with him into his cabin for some food. He expounded on the evil and violence of the People, who would send children to rescue a child. It was revealed that he had been banished as a coward for refusing to go raiding across the Dark Sea, and further, that he was the brother of Yuri Red Hand and the uncle of Rylka. The Wildlings asked him for his help on their quest. He refused. The smallest and youngest Wildling, the girl Sym, grasped his hand and rolled to open her heart (!). Hit, 7-9! He would lead them to the edge of the Ruins, and tell them about what lurked there.<br/><br/>He did so, saying along the way that a Beast of Darkness lurked, and it hated the light. The Wildlings should use their torches.<br/><br/>They came upon the Ruins, one black hole leading at an angle into the ground. Sym crawled up to listen at it. Failed roll! She tumbled in with a yelp. Everyone rushed in, Sym was okay but scratched up. It was a stinking black hole, bits of fur and flesh stuck to the rough walls where they had been torn off as someone was dragged down into the dungeon. Someone made their way down the corridor, while the others followed. He got a 7-9: slipped in a hidden hole, hanging by his fingers. Two others came up to help him, and failed: they all tumbled into the hole together. They could hear the breathing of something in the next room, and bid the other two still in the corridor to come down. They tied a rope to a rock in the corridor, and came down.<br/><br/>They went into the next room where Rylka was whimpering, clutching a sheep. When she saw the Wildlings, her eyes widened and she began shaking. Teeth flashed behind her, and a Beast of dark fur and razor teeth charged the group. Sym ripped Rylka away from the sheep and put her on her back (successful roll), running into the other room where the rope lead up and out. The others were keeping the Beast at bay with torches. Sym began climbing up the rope with Rym on her back. Failed roll! One tug and the rope tumbles down. The Beast has now backed everyone into the small room that Sym and Rylka are in. Someone attacks the Beast, holding it against the wall, creating an opening for the rest of the group. They all flee out the door into the room the Beast came from, and find a staircase that leads them out of the dungeon. The Beast screams behind them. End!</i><br/><br/>So it was fun! Five players was a lot, though. I\u2019m capping it at 4 when I run it with kids. Notice that I didn\u2019t mention the adverb choices in the AP: those definitely affected the fiction: How people were doing what they were doing, and what complications came into play for mixed successes and failures. I didn\u2019t feel as beholden to making mixed successes hard on the players, though: sometimes they created complications, and sometimes they were treated as just a success, depending on the circumstances of the fiction. If there were no believable complications, it was just a success, and that felt fine. Actually, I just looked at the PDF again: there\u2019s nothing about mixed successes\u2014so that\u2019s my AW baggage. It\u2019s pretty obvious that only choosing one adverb, though, leaves things wide open for the GM to create complications based on what you didn\u2019t choose, and I think that\u2019s the intention of the rules.<br/><br/>I did have some adverb fatigue by the end, though. In the climactic fight/escape, it kind of didn\u2019t matter what adverb they picked: we all knew what people were trying to do: \u201cI\u2019m trying to climb the rope and escape!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m trying to attack the Beast!\u201d. I knew what the result would be on a success, mixed success, or failure in those cases, and the adverbs didn\u2019t seem to matter too much. I don\u2019t know if the players felt this way, but as GM choosing adverbs after every roll wore thin after two hours.<br/><br/>There were also a lot of times when the Wildlings were all rolling at the same time for various things, and that worked real well: I had them say what they were doing, and all roll at the same time, and depending on their results we had a very dynamic, organic situation emerge from the mixture of successes, failures, and mixed successes.<br/><br/>There was also a player who kind of turtled the whole time. She mostly LARPs and this is the first pick-up-and-play game she\u2019s played. She was the one spearheading the refusal to leave early at the beginning of the game, she was the one who wouldn\u2019t interact with the woodsman, just describing her character on the outside of the hut, listening and wary; in the Ruins she hung out in a corner while Sym saved Rylka and the others kept the Beast at bay. She didn\u2019t drag the game down or anything, but she didn\u2019t contribute much. She said it was the most fun she\u2019d had roleplaying with strangers, though (we played at a game store), and I believed her.<br/><br/>I might have more thoughts. Prep forthcoming.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367206/#Comment_367206" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T12:23:57+00:00" title="March 13, 2012 12:23PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was pretty fun. I played Adric, the sneaky scout who had sworn to protect Sym (though she really didn't need it).<br/>I think a great deal of fun was had in figuring out starting relationships, and that helped set the tone of the rest of the game (even though it meant a bit of yaoi going on between Adric and ...uh, Ben Hsu's character). But it did, at least for me, help inform how I wanted my character to act, even if it wasn't always the most heroic or wise things to do.<br/><br/>Since then (last Thursday), I've been trying to compile as much info as I can, gleaned from the feedback of others here and elsewhere, trying to fill in the gaps left in the original game rules. I, too, can't really figure a good, solid way to get Marks. Obtained from challenges? If so, what kind of challenges? Obtained because you learn from your failures? Well, what failures determine what kind of lesson, and therefore what kind of Mark?<br/>We did have a good idea about how Marks could work though (can't remember the fellow's name who came up with the idea...I think it was Sym's player...), but when you get a Mark for a particular Spirit, you can then use that Mark to use the Spirit for a roll not normally related to it. So, like using an Owl mark to roll your Owl die when hunting, instead of Wolf.<br/>My thoughts on it, right now, are running along the lines of making Oaths, promises to help other characters, whether from PCs or NPCs, and then trading these in for Marks...maybe?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367250">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367250/#Comment_367250" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T14:42:22+00:00" title="March 13, 2012  2:42PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cooool!

For example:<br/><br/>Danger<br/>When you face danger, test your Bravery. You act... <br/>* forcefully<br/>* quickly<br/>* cautiously<br/>* precisely<br/> <br/>Difficulty <br/>When you struggle against difficulties, test your Patience. You act...<br/>* cleverly<br/>* carefully<br/>* thoroughly<br/>* helpfully<br/> <br/>We haven't experienced any adverb fatigue yet, because (I think) it's not the same set of words coming up every time, and each adverb creates a clearly different effect in the fiction (as opposed words with a lot of overlap, like "carefully" and "quietly"). Of course you can also create other moves which don't use adverbs at all (but still fit with the pattern of choosing simple words) allowing for more diversity within the same basic framework. <br/><br/>Knowledge <br/>If you closely study something, test your Wisdom. You discover its\u2026 <br/>* history<br/>* powers<br/>* weaknesses<br/>* secret<br/>(+1 to your next test, if you act on this knowledge)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367363/#Comment_367363" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T22:33:02+00:00" title="March 13, 2012 10:33PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, that's nifty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
