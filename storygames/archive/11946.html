I share these with you because I think they illustrate ignorances on the two sides and may help people here better understand where story games are not working for some seasoned gamers.<br/><br/><b>The first area is around immersion and stance.</b><br/><br/>There is a spectrum from a player totally inhabiting the skin of his or her character and interacting with the game fiction entirely through the capabilities of that character (well call this the left side) to the player being completely external to the character and the setting and manipulating those elements from the outside (well call that the right side).  Very roughly, I'd say that Spirit of the Century is maybe somewhere in the middle of that line.<br/><br/>Your trad player generally hangs out somewhere on the left side.  If you ask him or her to go too far to the right, you pull them out of their feeling of immersion, of being in and participating in another world. <br/><br/>This desire for immersion is often tantamount and it can be enabled by an authoritarian GM with absolute power.  Thus your trad player will suffer some of the negative elements that go along with that immersion to varying degrees.  Gaining the player power needed to prevent a GM from abusing their power may damage the immersion so much that it isn't worth it.<br/><br/>However, good trad groups on the left side know that immersion is enabled by strong communication among the group, pre-agreed upon conventions and a good system.<br/><br/>I know a lot of this is not new.  I share it with you because I get the feeling from what I've read here that a lot of you are on the right side of this spectrum and you've gone there because of the abuse you see inherent in a system that limits player power to their role in the setting.  <br/><br/>The horror for the right-side gamer is a total loss of power and a lot of you, it sounds like, have actually experienced this.<br/><br/>The horror for the left side gamer is a total loss of immersion and the feeling of being outside the world.<br/><br/>From these two horrors, I suspect we get a lot of the angry, dismissive, critical and generally negative feelings between the two camps.<br/><br/>I would ask that we try to separate our horrors when we look at gamers on the other side of the spectrum and really try to understand why they play the way they do.<br/><br/>I also recognize that there are many gamers who can move up and down that line.  I tend to be in the center left.  I'll definitely play in a one-shot on the right of the line (say, Inspectres) but I wouldn't want to participate in an entire campaign of Primetime Adventures for example (though if I had unlimited free time, I would without hesitation).<br/><br/>The second area is conflict, but I realize this post went on way too long.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266870/#Comment_266870" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T10:24:41+00:00" title="April 13, 2010 10:24AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are definitely all kinds of exceptions and edge cases, but I do think that immersion vs. control is at the very least a useful metric for distinguishing some very different kinds of RPGs. Having spent a lot of my "career" as a gamer being the GM, I think I don't value immersion as much as many more mainstream folks do (and I wonder if that's part of an overall trend, or just something about me, but I have no idea). As a wannabe game designer I think I'm still feeling out how to contend with immersion, but I'm increasingly of the opinion that like a lot of things (the GM and other roles, conflict rules, etc.) immersion is something where it's best to think in terms of a choice about what you think is best for the game at hand. I know my works in progress vary wildly in terms of where they fall on the spectrum you're talking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266875/#Comment_266875" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T10:37:35+00:00" title="April 13, 2010 10:37AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To me at least I think "Immersion" is not a factor or rather it's a symptom and not the cause, i'm looking more hopefully to your part two about conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to be in the characters head and in the world but I want the action that's taking place to be meaningful to me so I can get into it.  I cant care about a character on a meaningless shopping trip that goes nowhere.  I cant really get into meandering through a prescripted plot that doesnt have much relevance to the character.  The best indie games work to bring meaning into the action and the characters, trad games rely entirely on the skill of the gm to understand what is dramatic to the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266888/#Comment_266888" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T11:34:40+00:00" title="April 13, 2010 11:34AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's going to be interesting to hear how others reflect their own experiences on yours, Olman. Don't mind if I do! Thus:<br><br>Personally I'm totally down with the idea that the player's role in most games is to "play his character", to put something with many varieties rather roughly. I've actually written about this now and then, about how important the character-playing role is for how many rpgs generate teh funny. Most significantly, it seems to me that the parts of the alternative scene that actually seem insightful and fun in play rather agree with me on this: roleplaying games tend to predominantly be fun when you've got a player playing a character, which is to say, a player deciding what a character does. There are plenty of rough drafts of games that don't do this, but the finished products are fewer, and fewer still are the successes in roleplaying without character-play.<br/><br/>If the above seems to be phrased in a funny way, it's because I want to emphasize the idea that "playing a character" is a family of techniques, not an ultimate definition of good roleplaying. I'd be symphatetic towards a reasoned claim that all fun and worthwhile games involve playing a character, but that's mostly because character-play is so amazingly powerful as a tool of play that we've yet to get any consistently competitive alternatives. Much ink has flown on "parlor narration" and "conch passing" and "narration games", for instance - these are games that construe the basic player activity as telling a story instead of playing a character, which has proved to be rather controversial due to how many people (myself included) seem to find such games only pale shadows of roleplaying at its full power.<br/><br/>However, while the above would seem to superficially put me on the left side of your continuum, it also seems to me that the understanding of character-playing you expose is ultimately of a different order from character-play as mere technique; if I understand you correctly, you're saying not only that character-playing is effective technique, but also that character immersion, achieved by character-play, is a desirable goal of play - indeed, that it is the very apex of left-side play. This matches my experience among "Forge-games": while the great majority of these games use character-playing intensively, they are also remarcably uncaring of player immersion; most great games of the Forge subculture involve complex shifting of gears when the players engage different techniques in turn, including character-play and other methods. As a simple example, consider conflict narration: the typical procedural solution for a narration-sharing conflict resolution in Forge games is for the players to first maneuver their characters into a conflict situation via character-play, by making choices as their characters; however, when the conflict is resolved, the player is expected to discard the singular technique of character-play for a moment to narrate the flow and consequences of the conflict fairly and with the interests of the fiction in mind. In hindsight we can see this as a pretty clear way of resolving the old traditional gaming problem issue of my character vs. our campaign: instead of asking a player to compromise the integrity of his character play <i>or</i> the integrity of the overall fiction we ask the player to switch between different techniques and viewpoints on play. Whenever you choose how your character will act you do with absolute character integrity and whenever you're narrating general events, you do it impartially.<br/><br/>That's a rather large difference in goals, values and techniques - on this I agree with you, Olman. I don't know if I recognize the authority abuse angle, though; trad gamers in discussion often recognize an authority struggle or suspicion of GM authority as the underlying cause for why Forgers don't like the same games they do, but I think it goes a bit deeper than that: I just don't care about immersion, really, by almost any definition of the word that is specific enough to not be useless. I have no trouble switching gears in play, it's no different from separating IC/OOC knowledge. And I definitely don't think that my emotional relationship to the events of the game is dependent on being in-character all the time. For these reasons I just don't find the loss of IC integrity a very big price to pay for the exciting possibilities offered by demoting character-play into a mere technique - a valuable technique with immense power, but still just a technique that is engaged as necessary.<br/><br/>What we have here is basically an introduction into the good old immersion discussion. It's a good one, to be sure, although it does easily bog down into trying to pin down what the word means. For me it's not a controversial thing, though, as immersion rarely shows up as a concrete goal or means for my game design. Insofar as there is immersion to be had in my games, it's as the successful result of an interesting game, just like it would be in a boardgame.<br/><br/>Anyway - a great post, Olman. I wouldn't mind seeing others start threads for a personal overview of how they see the trad/alternative thing right now. Seems like a much better way of getting your viewpoint down than the long debate-like thing we've been doing.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266891/#Comment_266891" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T11:42:04+00:00" title="April 13, 2010 11:42AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like the spectrum of immersion idea, but as I see it your either in or out.<br/>\nThe group I game with will fluctuate caused by for example:<br/>\nThe DM narrates a tavern scene full atmospheric stuff and one of the guys say " so how\u2019s the coin system work again" Fucks me come the replies I was getting into that.<br/>\nOr like you say DM classic over ruling or taking control of your character.<br/>\nSome one start silly voices with giggles, brings the gaming out of immersion every time.<br/>\nOne of our DM's likes full on in character details you should remember  "Give me your papers!

I have to admit I always have some suspicion about people who only play games on the far right, that they can't really be having fun, because they aren't truly "in the game".  I say that a bit facetiously, because I know they are having fun and the issue is that my mind doesn't quite understand where the heart of that fun is.  So you saying that you don't care about immersion is a very helpful data point for me.  I see, though, that you don't discard it altogether, but you definitely don't give it primacy.  So where is the fun for you?  Is it in some rich combination of the many techniques that come together in some way that you find satisfying?  Is it the story that results or the live interaction at the table that has some kind of creative coherence?  I'm just throwing ideas out there because I'm not really sure of what your answer will be.<br><br>Being a bit bald and ignoring many nuances, edge cases and exceptions, I'll say that for people on the left part of my imaginary line, being in the world <i>is </i>the fun.  That's it.  Now within that, there is a multi-dimensional spectrum, but if done well, that can be sufficient for satisfying game play.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266901/#Comment_266901" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T12:13:02+00:00" title="April 13, 2010 12:13PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>Screw character-play.

I'd love to see a roadmap to character-less play, or even a realized design that was more fun than <i>Once Upon a Time</i> (which scales pretty low insofar as rpg fun goes, frankly). As things stand, I won't even try to phrase anything on the topic in a transient discussion like this - you know that this shit be serious when I'm not even willing to make an ass of myself by pretending to know the absolute Truth about it.<br/><br/>I know that I've been linking <a href="http://isabout.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/the-pitfalls-of-narrative-technique-in-rpg-play/" rel="nofollow">this theory post</a> I made a while back, but apparently I was riding some sort of wave there, as everybody seems to be discussing the same topics now. At the end of that longish post I lay out much of what I know about character play, including my understanding of advocacy-type games like we often make at the Forge. My point is, I know exactly why I need to have characters in a narrativistic (story-generating rather than story-depicting, dig) roleplaying game, and it's all about the experience a player derives from the core activities required of him in a game; character-play happens to be effortless and also fun when the accountrements are functional; replacing it requires defining other player roles that can match character-play as a method.<br/><br/>But anyways, character-play as technique vs. immersion as a goal or core aesthetic - making any sense, Olman?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266906/#Comment_266906" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T12:31:19+00:00" title="April 13, 2010 12:31PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just as a data point, "immersion" doesn't do anything for me, either.

I say that a bit facetiously, because I know they are having fun and the issue is that my mind doesn't quite understand where the heart of that fun is.  So you saying that you don't care about immersion is a very helpful data point for me.  I see, though, that you don't discard it altogether, but you definitely don't give it primacy.  So where is the fun for you?  Is it in some rich combination of the many techniques that come together in some way that you find satisfying?  Is it the story that results or the live interaction at the table that has some kind of creative coherence?  I'm just throwing ideas out there because I'm not really sure of what your answer will be.<br/><br/>Being a bit bald and ignoring many nuances, edge cases and exceptions, I'll say that for people on the left part of my imaginary line, being in the world<i>is</i>the fun.  That's it.  Now within that, there is a multi-dimensional spectrum, but if done well, that can be sufficient for satisfying game play.</blockquote>\nWhat you say about the left side of the spectrum definitely matches my experience - both of living in that part through the '90s and of discussing the matter with gamers. I think that it's a core part of the whole traditional gaming thing, explaining many of the inclinations therein, that the game is secondary to the fiction: it's OK to ignore the rules, it's OK to play all games in the same ways, it's OK to develop a strong gamer identity, because what you're really doing is a journey of mastery over a skill-set of imaginauting and not just playing a single game here and now. It's a journey you make by improving your skills, developing a long-term team, perhaps investing a lot in a single campaign... and the reward is a strong experience of being there, what we might call "robust Exploration" or "robust fiction" in Forge terminology. What you do with the fiction is somewhat secondary to being able to create and maintain it consistently, and any game design or external sources of fluff are only there to facilitate this. This totally makes sense to me even if it's not what I'm currently interested in myself.<br/><br/>In comparison, my own deal with roleplaying games is totally all about the <i>game</i> nowadays. I don't know why this is, but I strongly suspect that it's due to my improvement as a writer - I no longer reside in the desk drawer writing territory like I did as a teenager, I no longer have to express my art as a GM - today I'm near utterly disinterested in waking up in the middle of the night, having a great idea for an adventure, writing it down and then playing it with friends. I don't pick campaigns to play, I pick games, and when I want to do fiction for fiction's sake, I opt to write, instead. What carries my roleplaying is the idea that the imaginary process/environment (called Shared Imagined Space in Forge theory) can be utilized in many interesting and delightful ways for making interesting games: you can have a game that out of the experience of play weaves a story, for example, or you can have a game that'll give you a rich tactical skirmish combat environment, or you can use the fictional environment created by the tools we know for other exciting purposes. The issue of forming a robust fiction, however necessary, is somewhat secondary as a concern for me. This could be because I don't have any routine problems with doing it or because I have lower standards in my immersion than the traditional gamer - whatever the cause, the practice is that I almost always choose to use gaming technique, mechanics and procedures that flout the fiction in favour of benefitting a game. IC/OCC firewalls do not matter to me, speaking in-character does not matter to me, having the rules break down in the middle of play isn't that big a deal... the fiction is no magical thing to be protected, it's a simple pre-requirement for playing the game itself.<br/><br/>As for the game part, there are plenty of reasons to go for roleplaying specifically instead of other types of games. The virtues of game in general are, however, illustrative of what I like in roleplaying: for example, I absolutely adore the controlled chaos of having a system of procedures simplify cooperation in ways that allow us to work together in creating something without anybody actually having to coordinate it. I like being able to simplify reality into a stylized depiction, like games do. I also like how games allow us to strive and learn in a controlled environment. Plenty of reasons for appreciating a game, and combining that with the fictional possibilities of roleplaying, you get plenty of opportunity for this medium of ours.<br/><br/>I don't think that my preoccupation with the game part is that uncommon in the end. I wouldn't have any idea, but I suspect that old '70s roleplaying would have mostly held a similar idea of the purpose and requirements of the fiction. At least I don't encounter a lot of texts complaining about the robustness of the fiction and how it gets broken - all that comes in later, through the late '80s, as roleplaying gets occupied with performing a story and heightening the artistic quality of the experience. I am pretty convinced personally that this was something of a dead end in certain ways for the hobby - roleplaying is a medium for art and game, but the artistry is not in the fragile, hypnotic illusion of being there, it seems to me, but rather in the interaction and raw communication between the participants. It's like cave painting, not photograph.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266909/#Comment_266909" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T12:38:43+00:00" title="April 13, 2010 12:38PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Vernon R</cite>To me at least I think "Immersion" is not a factor or rather it's a symptom and not the cause, i'm looking more hopefully to your part two about conflict.<br/><br/>I want to be in the characters head and in the world but I want the action that's taking place to be meaningful to me so I can get into it.  I cant care about a character on a meaningless shopping trip that goes nowhere.  I cant really get into meandering through a prescripted plot that doesnt have much relevance to the character.  The best indie games work to bring meaning into the action and the characters, trad games rely entirely on the skill of the gm to understand what is dramatic to the players.</blockquote>\nVery interesting post.  Your thoughts helped me to make a connection between my first post and what I wanted to say about conflicts.  Although it really muddies things up.<br/><br/>First of all, let me say that simply the line that I made up is a two-dimensional thing.  Within any point on that line, there are several other spectrums that affect gameplay satisfaction for the individual.  In your case, it sounds like you are happy with a certain level of immersion, but you need more than just being in the world to be satisfied and have fun.  Kind of a simplistic response to the problem you pose which is quite complex and one that I personally am still struggling with.  I do think, in my limited experience, that the Burning games may be some of the best systems for solving this dilemma, though I am not smart enough nor experienced enough with them to explain why.<br/><br/>Please indulge me in explaining my other imaginary spectrum line and that is one of conflict.  This line is not as well-imagined and is theoretically much weaker than my immersion one so please bear with me and don't be overly critical of its flaws.  It's also probably not very original.  I think it will at least serve to allow some people to be able to look across the gap and have a slightly easier time in understanding how the other enjoys him or herself.<br/><br/>The conflict line goes like this:  <br/><br/>On the left side you have an imaginary world that just exists.  Pure setting if you will that would exist with or without the PCs.  There may or may not be PC-relevant conflicts here.  It depends entirely on what the PCs do.  On the right side, the world is made up entirely of characters with interlocking conflicts.  There is no 'stuff' other than individuals in conflict with other individuals.<br/><br/>(I warned you this one was rather messy.)<br/><br/>I'm going to take a little detour and talk about general culture, education and demographics.  There is a general dogma in creative writing  and Hollywood circles about conflict, that there must be conflict to tell a good story.  You can see a strong example of that in the recent meme of David Mamet's memo to his show-writers.  I don't think it's outrageous to say that that dogma holds in the story game community as well. (This is also getting into danger territory here because I believe there is a real value hierarchy built into this dogma, that not accepting it or being aware carries the risk of being considered unsophisticated and I think this falls into issues of class, education and even politics to some degree.  In other words, there is a "horror" here and it is part of the reason there is a lot of rancour around this issue in trad/indie arguments.)<br/><br/>In my experience with RPGs, that dogma is just a location on the line I created above.  There are many gamers for whom conflict is not a priority.  I don't think I can go so far as to say there is no need at all for conflict, but it can be pretty minimal.  There are many gamers for whom "I went to the market and there was a guy selling a cool mechanical bird" is a good story.  Buying equipment is a classic example of this (and a mainstay of computer RPGs).  Games like Harn are popular for a reason.  This is a complete and functioning world and just existing in it is fun.  There is not necessarily a need for any conflict.<br/><br/>So the horror here for the trad gamer is the so-called "misery tourism" where every scene is a hand-wringing, gut-wrenching conflict like those horrible drama classes where the pseudo-intellectuals in high school had their one chance to dominate.<br/><br/>And the horror for the indie gamer is, what?  A lack of meaning?  I'm going to have to ask others to fill this in for me because I'm pretty far left on the spectrum here.  When I played GTA, I really enjoyed just walking around.<br/><br/>I think this one is a bit more flabby.  But my main point is just to demonstrate that for a lot of gamers, conflict is not a raison d'\xeatre.<br/><br/>I also realized that I probably should have flipped the direction of my lines because it's probably not too erroneous to say that in both cases, the people on what I said was the left probably are more conservative in the classic sense of the word, pertaining to RPGs (meaning they are not so in favour of change and prefer the traditions that have existed in the past).<br/><br/>And the horror here for the indie gamer                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266914">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266914/#Comment_266914" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T12:44:48+00:00" title="April 13, 2010 12:44PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2010 12:46PM by marknau.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>So the horror here for the trad gamer is the so-called "misery tourism" where every scene is a hand-wringing, gut-wrenching conflict like those horrible drama classes where the pseudo-intellectuals in high school had their one chance to dominate.<br/><br/>And the horror for the indie gamer is, what?

We had a little conflict in my group last night where I felt the other players were going too far into character and it ended up undermining most of the adventure the GM had planned for us.  I was arguing for us to step back a bit from "what our characters would do" to allow for the GM who is not super experienced and isn't comfortable with improvisation.  So in that case, I guess that character-play was a technique that wasn't quite working for us (and I didn't get the big fight on the train I wanted).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266916/#Comment_266916" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T12:46:04+00:00" title="April 13, 2010 12:46PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ludanto</cite>Just as a data point, "immersion" doesn't do anything for me, either.

They did mundane things and received skill checks and their abilities went up but very little ever happened in terms of conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's not like my experience with 'trad' gaming.  Most of the games I experience did involve conflicts that were relevant to the game system, a big epic quest would be typical in Gurps fantasy or AD&amp;D; 2nd ed.  The conflicts however were usually something not well connected to the characters, rather the system allowed for wild diversity of characters and the gm was forced to shoehorn them together to make the plot work.  The other possibility was one of tieing the characters to the plotline but making most sessions about subplots that dont have much emotional impact but give the players a chance to build their characters abilities and resources.  Gm's with a dramatic flair were better able to tie the subplots to the big picture in an engaging way others were more mathematical and proficient in system mastery.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266933/#Comment_266933" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T13:28:31+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  1:28PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So last year at Gen Con - erm, maybe the year before, actually - I ran InSpectres at Games on Demand.

When I was returning to the exhibitors hall I realized that the two folks in that last category were walking right behind me, talking about the game and obviously unaware that I was hearing their conversation. <br/><br/>"I don't like that kind of game. The GM just obviously makes it up as he's going along."<br/>"Yeh, it's like if we weren't there there wouldn't be anything going on."<br/><br/>And my reaction is like of COURSE if you weren't there there wouldn't be anything going on! Games don't exist when we're not playing them! <br/><br/>I dunno where that puts me on your lines or whatever, but thats what the last couple posts made me flash back too. <br/><br/>*this is actually a really specific behavior set for InSpectres in particular, in my experience, but thats another post.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266936/#Comment_266936" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T13:32:42+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  1:32PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>Who asks you "to determine what happens next in the game in terms of what is best for telling a cool story?"</blockquote>\nMaybe bad wording on my part.

I wrote about this in <i>Solar System</i> in a way that I think is pretty well applicable to most narrativistic adventure games out there. According to myself, you need a robust fiction, meaning a credible fiction, because otherwise the events in the game have no impact on the players. However, I follow, you also need to ensure that the actual game progresses towards meaning. I chose to call the balance between these two needs "dramatic coordination" in SS, making it a specific task for the Story Guide (the GM-equivalent of the game). According to the Solar System good dramatic coordination means recognizing the genre fidelity of the campaign and making choices of scene framing in a way that pushes the drama to whatever extent is allowed by the genre the players are doing. (For the purposes of Solar System, an ostensibly universal system, all campaigns have a genre - it might be more or less realistic, but we never lose sight of the fact that we're making a story.)<br/><br/>In practice dramatic coordination means forgoing dull choices when you can make exciting ones without breaking genre expectations. An example I use in the text is about when a player character is wandering alone in the woods after killing his brother's wife: insofar as it would not seem hopelessly contrived, the SG would be expected to continue the game by framing a scene where the character stumbles on a hermitage, some faeries, a king's reeve or perhaps his brother: just like a movie, we do not expect the SG to frame a scene where the character just wanders around and doesn't encounter anything interesting, even if that would be the most likely realistic choice. Even in the most raw, ugly realistic genre we would still skip over the part where the character wanders around for days, meets some cowherds, recuperates in their humble cottage for a month and then returns to the city to clear his name; we'd just note that this was what happened and frame directly into the next scene that actually matters for the story.<br/><br/>Solar System is not every roleplaying game out there, but for the purposes of that game I'm pretty happy with the above heuristic: you suffer dull realism only to the extent required to give the campaign the realistic frisson expected by the group for this campaign. A superhero campaign will be highly stylized and involve a lot of dramatic coordination, while a historical costume drama will have considerably less while still being nowhere near start reality.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the above discussion concerns the ways a GM chooses to exert his powers in scene framing - that is, in choosing what matters are dealt with next and what things are experienced by the player characters. It's a big sector of a GM's overall power, but it's technically separate from his backstory authority - the ability to invent the setting and situation the characters find themselves in. In this regard Solar System is very traditional: the SG has full freedom to create a backstory situation as he would, and he's expected to stick by whatever he invents, but he's not forced to do this in advance: insofar as this particular game is concerned, there's no meaningful difference in whether the SG decides about what's beyond the next valley before the session or in the middle of it as long as he makes the choice according to the right criteria. Specifically, "dramatic coordination" I describe above is a separate power and responsibility from "backstory definition" - you're not supposed to mix up the two by changing the backstory in the flight to make it more interesting; that's beyond the scope of dramatic coordination, which only concerns introducing the backstory into play without undue delay, not changing the backstory to artificially make it as awesome as possible.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's just something that came to mind from the discussion of Lost and X-Files. Solar System is pretty representative of your average Forge-style adventure game in that while it recommends strong dramatic coordination, it does not advocate No Myth - that being our special jargon for a fluid backstory where player characters "just happen" to walk into the same city no matter which road they take. If one wanted to phrase this as reality vs. arbitrary staging, I guess you could characterize it as "enhanced reality": we skip over the dull scenes and assume coincidences that will bring the interesting stuff into play sooner, just like a movie script would, but we don't take liberties with the characters and backstory to artificially tailor drama.<br/><br/>There are of course games that take more or less radical stances on this issue, as with everything else, all to the benefit of whatever goals the designer had in mind. Personally I can enjoy No Myth games, too - it doesn't bother me that we're not pretending that the setting exists outside the immediately necessary dramatic context, as long as this choice of dropping the setting serves an useful purpose. <i>Zombie Cinema</i> is like this, actually: in that game the backstory is extremely sparse, it really just consists of whatever has been brought into play so far. You're still not supposed to contradict prior narration, so it's not quite at the extremes of postmodern mindfuckery possible <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Also: I hate "whose vision of the story willl we go with". I don't find that interesting at all myself. Luckily it's very rare outside rought drafts, and it seems that not many games like that get much traction. <i>Houses of the Blooded</i> comes to mind, mainly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_266946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266946/#Comment_266946" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T13:58:23+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  1:58PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was a discussion on NerdNYC a while back about this sort of thing, and one of the conclusions we came to was that, like in fiction, there are different points of enjoyment. The Forge vocabulary uses the term "exploration" to be practically synonymous with "roleplaying" (as in the activity, the hobby, as a whole; not the act of portraying a character). I think that's a good word that describes a lot of what we do as gamers.<br/><br/>Anyway, given that view or RPGs, a bit of a dichotomy emerged: some people seemed to be really excited about the idea of exploring an environment, a world, a place. The character is the "interface", but the real goal of play is basically to go around and look at things, sometimes from a distance, sometimes by getting your hands right in there. You're literally "discovering" a place or time, feeling your way around, like a child exploring a new house or park. At some extremes, this point of view might be parodied by a nature documentary--we just look at things and learn about them. <br/><br/>The other side of the discussion was focused around people who were more interested in the exploration of "Character": who's who, why are they that way, how will they change, what decisions will they make? Many dramatic critics, literary theorists, and authors say that exploration of character is at the basis of good fiction. Here, the interest is in personal action, personal belief, decisions and consequences. A parody of this kind of focus might be a television soap like "All My Children"--every scene is an interpersonal conflict or revelation of character, and, really, the events could take place anywhere, it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>This interacts in interesting and unexpected ways with the "immersion line" you have drawn, walkerp. And I think that's why Eero's point that character-play is a technique and not an end in itself is very important. For instance, I've met players who are really into the exploration of "environment", who really don't care what the character is about at all. The designer of MYST once said (wish I had the link) that the game was inspired by D&amp;D, except without the concept of an "avatar" or "character" for the player to embody, because that just puts you at another remove from the place you're discovering. Why pretend you're someone else exploring a place, when it's so much more primal to just explore it yourself?<br/><br/>I've also played with some gamers who are really into "old-school renaissance"/basic D&amp;D-type play, and love their games, where they go through dozens of characters, all thrown into the same dungeon. They love that exploration aspect, but they really aren't terribly attached to the characters they play: they laugh with glee when their characters die and roll up new ones.<br/>' <br/>Meanwhile, someone really interested in exploring character might also fit anywhere in your spectrum: a "left-side" player might be like a LARPer or Jeepform player, who wants to sit in a closet for four hours and just experience "being trapped". They want the emotional experience of a character's plight--playing a game where their character could die at any time would totally throw off their "immersion". A "right-side" player might be more like a GM in a traditional game: they want to throw characters into situations and see what happens to them. ("Jake chose to sacrifice his dignity in order to keep his job. Interesting! Now let's see what happens when his old flame shows up and offers him an ultimatum...") They might really enjoy maneuvering a character through a series of transformations, and, while they are doing so, portraying the character. But they're never trying to fool themselves into thinking that they ARE the character.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why I'm typing all this, but I think a lot of these dichotomies can be useful to understanding different styles of play. What I like about that is that it gives me tools to understand different gaming styles and then to be able to jump in and enjoy them. That's really valuable! I don't believe any of these dichotomies are really just a one-dimensional line, but if we treat them as simplifications we can look at until we see something better, they can be useful to us.<br/><br/>Incidentally, that's the main draw of "indie/new school" games for me: an effort has been made to outline what is fun about them and how to engage that. My main complaint about "traditional" gaming is that it is full of assumptions about what it is, and it's really difficult for me to figure out how to fit in and enjoy the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_266948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/266948/#Comment_266948" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T14:08:38+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  2:08PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to interject a slight note of dissension here.

I too went through a very similar evolution, not as much concerned with the prep but my own ego is so dominant that I found myself creating the overarching story arc ahead of the players and then consciously and later unconsciously driving them along that path more or less.  Like you, it was not interesting for me.  I might as well just write the story down.<br/><br/>But I didn't need to turn to a new system to remedy it.  I just needed to change my own style and approach to the game.    The players can just as liberally add their creativity to the game using a trad system (or to stick to the thread topic a little more closely) being way over on the left in terms of immersion.  <br/><br/>I've seen this as a GM and twice now in good long campaigns as a player, one using Unknown Armies and the other using ORE.  In both cases, nobody involved in the game had any idea how it would end up and the results were surprising, rich and interesting.  In the Unknown Armies game, the GM several times would be jumping up out of his seat with a sort of hysterical joy at how crazy and unexpected things had become.<br/><br/>A really good example of this is the Unknown Armies one-shot Jailbreak.  I've played in 3 sessions of that game and each time the outcome was wildly and creatively different.  What's the situation?

Seems like it happened that way for a bunch of other folks my age, too.<br/><br/>I was in my early 20s before I ever read Fritz Leiber's Fafhyrd and Gray Mouser stuff, which apparently had a much bigger impact on guys like Gygax and Arneson than Tolkien did originally. Leiber makes shit up constantly. I mean, it evolves into something more coherent and canon-heavy <i>later</i>. Two-Gun Bob's stuff and HPL's stuff is the same way. Same applies to the Star Wars setting and the Star Trek setting. Or hell, Love and Rockets comics and just about the entire Marvel Universe.<br/><br/>I haven't the foggiest notion why there is an attraction to fully realized universe concept among gamers, though. Even a cursory examination of the wildly popular oWoD will show that the thing was constantly evolving and changing over the course of its run.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267026/#Comment_267026" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T21:38:22+00:00" title="April 13, 2010  9:38PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the difference is that while trad games allow for open ended play they dont do much to support it and many of the traditions and texts make suggestions that run counter to the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example GURPS 3rd edition rulebook suggests the GM as author model, when you write an adventure they suggest developing an outline and subtly guiding the players to the climax.  It looks like they havent changed this at all in the 4th edition book.  WFRP 2nd edition had something similar though more harsh text, describing the GM role as a director and giving warnings that players may try to subvert your plot but remember that the plot is yours put them in their place if they get out of line.   I've seen it in several other trad books though not all of them, the only recipe for open ended play in a trad game I've seen was Skyrealms of Jorune but the playstyle described wasnt very dramatic or compelling more of a travelog where exploring the wilderness was the main point of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nIndie games on the other hand are straight forward that they are trying to promote open ended play and that preplanning how games turn out is a recipe for failure.  It's not just mechanics but advice and guidance given by the game designers, which admittedly may be more available in the internet based form they've come from rather than a book on a shelf in a store.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_267031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267031/#Comment_267031" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-13T22:12:38+00:00" title="April 13, 2010 10:12PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2010 10:15PM by TomasHVM.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>I think there are two areas where you can really find dividing lines between gamers currently.

In high school, I drifted into other hobbies, like writing, art, failing miserably to pick up chicks, and, eventually, music. Years later, I got into RPGs again and finally had experiences that I could draw upon to express the difference between playing and GMing -- participating in a traditional RPG is like composing and playing a song with a band. <br/><br/>The difference is, when you're GMing, you're bringing <i>your</i> song to the rest of the band and watching it get transformed into a group effort; when you're "just playing", you're taking <i>someone else's</i> song and turning it into a group effort. In either case, the finished product is invariably different from and better than whatever the original author brought in, but your role in the transition from A Song to Our Song is quite different.<br/><br/>And now that I think about it, "just playing" is way harder. Which leads me to believe that many of those times I thought I was "stuck GMing" -- because I'm almost <i>always</i> the one stuck GMing -- there was more choice on my part than I wanted to admit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267082/#Comment_267082" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T08:16:42+00:00" title="April 14, 2010  8:16AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite><br/>I don't mean to keep picking on you Paul, because I'm sure your experiences are real and valid.

So, no hard feelings here. I'm enjoying this (these) discussions. That's what I come to a place like this (Story Games) for: to learn more about how and why people play roleplaying games.<br/><br/>Here's what it looks like from where I'm standing: that transition you're describing is exactly what I went through as well. As written, traditional games (roughly from the 90's period, right?) tended to devolve, for me and most people I played with, into exactly what you describe. In addition, the texts often encouraged that kind of play (like the various advice to steer the players towards one outcome or another). There were a number of assumptions happening that led to this kind of dysfunction. My experience with "trad" play was that it was a ton of fun *most of the time* but occasionally just ground down to a halt, and some of those terrible "gamer horror" stories. And no one knew what to do about it: it was just an expected "miss rate" of roleplaying. You'd have three great sessions, then one crappy one. That's just how it was.<br/><br/>Over time, like yourself, I developed my own tools (well outside the written text) to make that kind of play more fun and more reliable. But, while it reduced the "miss rate", it didn't eliminate it entirely--and it was a LOT of work. <br/><br/>(Incidentally, one-shots seemed much more successful on this front. As you describe, I've seen people play out one-shots in all sorts of unexpected, fun ways. But over the long term, the group was lacking the tools to make that happen reliably. Part of the problem was the assumption that all games should be long-term, by default. But that's a whole other can of beans!)<br/><br/>Here's what Dave wrote:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Where is the GM's fun supposed to come from?<br/><br/>And how is that working in symbiosis with where the players' fun is supposed to come from?<br/><br/>I think these are huge unanswered questions of a lot of trad games.

"indie" gamers are completely capable of loving "trad" play of the rocking variety.  They just need to find a game that shows them how the GM's supposed to have fun, and how that's manageable.  (Working on it...)</blockquote>\nThat's exactly my experience: over time, "trad" gamers develop some version of a functioning approach. I know I did, and it sounds like you have done so as well. But my experience is that those methods do not exist in the texts themselves (with the possible exception of early, early D&amp;D). We were all coming up with our own ways to git'er done. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, it meant that games were very unpredictable. Without clear communication, people went from game to game expecting the same gameplay, and then upset or shocked by the way another group played ('they're playing it wrong!"). <br/><br/>That's my main beef with "trad" play: there's just not enough communication about what's going on and how it should go on. It's easy for a group to break down when, for instance, the asumption is that all "metagame" talk is bad for the game. When players aren't allowed to tell the GM what they want from the game, and GMs aren't allowed to let the players in on "the secrets" of their game.<br/><br/>I found that frustrating, as both player and GM. It's not the games couldn't be unpredictable--it's that we had to fight so hard to make them unpredictable. Does that make sense? When you say that trad gaming can be unpredictable and fun, I'm not disputing that. But I just want it to be more unpredictable and more fun more often--that "unpredictability" falls below my personal standard of fun.<br/><br/>Dave is one person who's trying to figure how to make a "trad game" that covers those gaps, and he's very close to it. Vincent Baker's Apocalypse World is another example of a "trad game" that attempts to outline exactly what to do and how the players have fun together.<br/><br/>I don't know if I'm fully making sense--but let's keep in mind that I'm just sharing my own subjective experience.<br/><br/>And for me, anyway, that distinction is important enough that I can't ignore it and claim that all games are the same. I just want to be able to play a game so it's easy and fun <i>all the time</i>. With "trad" games, after a long adjustment period (years of "training"), I can find that fun, and a lot of it. But not consistently, and not without a lot of work. <br/><br/>I also think that saying "trad games are immersive" and "indie games are not" misses out on the wide scope of games available to us. It may be true that this exists as a trend, but, as Tomas points out, there are many "indie" games that are much more heavily "immersive" than "trad" games, and there are many groups who play "trad" games without any attempt to "immerse" at all. Personally, I find The Shadow of Yesterday or Land of Nodd (one of my games) far more "immersive" for me than many "trad" games, where I constantly have to worry about whether the GM is going to do something weird we'll have to suddenly argue about, or where as GM I have to employ all sorts of mental gymnastics to keep the game unpredictable for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267104/#Comment_267104" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T10:50:14+00:00" title="April 14, 2010 10:50AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of folks have pointed out that making "trad" games fun takes "a lot of work".  By this, most seem to mean some level of awareness, concentration, keeping on top of things, and employing personal skills developed over lots of play.<br/><br/>I just want to chime in that I've found "story-first / indie" games to be <i>more</i> demanding in terms of awareness, concentration, and keeping on top of things during play.  And personal skills are just as vital (though perhaps quicker to develop).  Personally, I think "takes a lot of work" <i>could</i> be said of <i>any</i> successful roleplaying, and that who considers what to be "work" is largely just a matter of taste.<br/><br/>Of course, when one player somehow winds up entirely responsible for making the game fun, that's a poor distribution of this "work".  But I don't think that's definitional of the GM role in any game; it's just a pattern from "buy the game, become the authority on it, run it" plus poor group communication.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267106/#Comment_267106" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T10:55:43+00:00" title="April 14, 2010 10:55AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, that and the "mechanics are bad for immersion, put them outside the focus area of the group" value judgment (and definition of immersion, I guess.)<br/><br/>It's interesting, most GM advice sections of the time suggest talking to the players about what they want and what you want, but they are also big on surprises and keeping secrets.

I want there to be a song, not just a bunch of people jamming out on instruments while the bassist tries to keep them moving at the same speed and wishes he was the cool one.  If anything, I want the GM to be a manager, producer, and sound engineer: here's some sheet music and pencils to mark it up or rewrite it if you want to, here's the studio, play this your way and I'll tweak the knobs in the booth to make it sound good and maybe tell you to "add a catchier hook" or "play it softer" if it'll help.<br/><br/>But by saying this, I'm really stretching the analogy well past the breaking point.  What I probably mean to say is that while I'm down with what Ron Hammack was saying and see how it matches up to the games I like to play in, my gut tells me I would not enjoy playing in Ron Edward's game because it's going a little too far in a direction that I know I don't enjoy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267166/#Comment_267166" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T14:27:13+00:00" title="April 14, 2010  2:27PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>while the bassist tries to keep them moving at the same speed and wishes he was the cool one</blockquote>\nThe bass player IS the cool one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267168">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267168/#Comment_267168" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T14:30:41+00:00" title="April 14, 2010  2:30PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's so obvious that Ron never played in a band.<br/><br/>How many bands operate as a healthy, egalitarian social contract?

This thread just got awesome. <br/><br/>If you are all enjoying that, feel free to ignore the rest of this post!<br/><br/>That said:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite><br/>I just want to chime in that I've found "story-first / indie" games to be<i>more</i>demanding in terms of awareness, concentration, and keeping on top of things during play.  And personal skills are just as vital (though perhaps quicker to develop).  Personally, I think "takes a lot of work"<i>could</i>be said of<i>any</i>successful roleplaying, and that who considers what to be "work" is largely just a matter of taste.</blockquote>\nI guess that's the point, for me: that "work" is largely just a matter of taste. I've found that the "traditional" school of roleplaying, again, <i>for me</i>, presents more of a challenge in terms of negotiating Social Contract. Whereas many "indie" games are designed to make that part easier, and challenge the players more on a creative level. Personally, when I play a game, I'd much rather be worrying about the creative challenge than about the social challenge of playing the game and having fun, if that makes any sense.<br/><br/>I see a strong trend in "Forge-derived" games, probably due to the focus on Social Contract in the Big Model, to address the challenges that lie there, whereas the "traditional" school (boy, do these terms suck...) literature is really focused on addressing the creative challenges of play (e.g. "Here's a book of 300 magical items!"). That's a pretty significant distinction, I think. And, for me, a very important one.\n<blockquote><br/>Of course, when one player somehow winds up entirely responsible for making the game fun, that's a poor distribution of this "work".  But I don't think that's definitional of the GM role in any game; it's just a pattern from "buy the game, become the authority on it, run it" plus poor group communication.</blockquote>\nI think the argument brought up on this point was that the texts of the "traditional" school (which a lot of people have been referring to as a strong movement of the 90's) very strongly suggested, implied, or outright stated that this was the definition of the GM role. A term like "Storyteller" is telling in this context, I think.<br/><br/>And now I want to hear more musician jokes, with clever analogies to dysfunctional gaming!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267326/#Comment_267326" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T11:41:54+00:00" title="April 15, 2010 11:41AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2010 11:43AM by Paul_T.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, hey, an easy example, from my play history:<br/><br/>You know that classic problem with task resolution? When someone succeeds in what they were trying to do, but fails to get what they want, or vice-versa? Like when you're sneaking through a palace, and the GM just makes you roll until you fail?<br/><br/>I don't own any of those books, so I can't quote them for you, but I'm pretty sure I remember many gaming texts recommending just this approach to playing a game. And it's very easy for it to get into the sort of territory where it's incredibly frustrating for a player, either because a) they feel like their actions don't matter, or b) the game devolves into a whole lot of meaningless rolling without anything interesting going on (e.g. "Roll to climb the tree. Oh you failed? Yes, you can try again. Roll again. Failed again? Sigh... roll again.").<br/><br/>I've seen in several (different groups) this problem very quickly eradicated by the introduction of conscious conflict resolution and something like overt stakes-setting. In particular, it's interesting because in those groups we didn't switch to a different system (e.g. an "indie" game), but just made this one change, and suddenly gameplay was faster, more reliable, more fun, and no one felt like they were being screwed over anymore.<br/><br/>I hope that helps describe what I'm talking about: as a player or GM in that situation, the difficulty of making sure the non-fun stuff happened at the table was drastically reduced. Players didn't need to worry about somehow manipulating the GM or reading their mind in order to get what they want, and the GMs could stop worrying about whether they were being fair or unfair. Suddenly we found ourselves less worried about dealing with the social issues.<br/><br/>Now, yes, for some players that particular rule <i>might</i> reduce their sense of immersion. But even removing the "overt stakes-setting" bit, and letting the GM handle that in his or her mind ("invisibly"), would greatly reduce the problem I've mentioned above. (I'm pretty sure a lot of "trad" GMs have come up with this trick on their own over the years, too.)<br/><br/>And here's where I have an interesting question:<br/><br/>walkerp, you know how you said that you're very much on the "left" side of the immersion line you've described? And how you don't fully understand what "right" side players get out of gaming? <br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that you run games as a GM from time to time. What's the draw for as a GM? What do you enjoy about a game you're running? After all, you can't just "walk around and look at things", can you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267375/#Comment_267375" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T18:58:05+00:00" title="April 15, 2010  6:58PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting question.  I had to think about it a bit, because I don't GM for fun.  It's not that it's not fun. It's simply that I must GM.  I exist therefore I GM.  I love playing and have done way more of that than GM'ing in the last several years and when the game is good, I love playing.  But there is always some part of me that is thinking of how I would handle a given situation.  Or I have some crazy idea (a Survivor RPG where the shit truly hits the fan is currently percolating in my mind) that needs to get out there.  If I had someone who would do my GM bidding, I might well ask them to do it so that I could play in it, but that's not really feasible.<br/><br/>But I'm not really answering your question directly.  There are some broad elements of GMing that I love.  I love the challenge of arranging a creative situation that allows other people to have fun.  When it succeeds, it's a profound thrill.  I like being the center of attention.  <br/><br/>But here's what I really like.  What is the best is when I create a situation, a world, a setting with a bunch of potential stuff that will happen.   But it's frozen.  It's in rythmos.  It awaits the introduction of the characters as controlled by the players.  If I've done my job right and I do my job right during the game, the players imaginations and my imagination will meet in the neutral imaginary space structured by the rules and the dice (I see the randomness dice as the spark of actual life, they are God, the gods, the cosmos allowing the real to come into the world make it come alive) and create a living world where crazy shit happens.<br/><br/>I like to participate in that synthesis from either the player or the GM side, when it's done right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_267397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267397/#Comment_267397" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T22:55:33+00:00" title="April 15, 2010 10:55PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 15, 2010 10:56PM by TomasHVM.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: walkerp</cite>I see the randomness dice as the spark of actual life, they are God, the gods, the cosmos allowing the real to come into the world make it come alive</blockquote>I like that one.

Therefore your preferences on the "immersion line" don't apply to it?\n<blockquote>I like to participate in that synthesis from either the player or the GM side, when it's done right.</blockquote>\n...or maybe not?\n<blockquote><br/>But here's what I really like.

For me, that's where a lot of "traditional" assumptions can ruin the experience: for me, they often get in the way of that synthesis. <br/><br/>The most common issue (absent nasty railroading or social issues, etc) is probably: when the cool stuff, the stuff that is "in motion" in that frozen image, has been "played out", how do we get more fun? I've seen a lot of games fumble because they don't have a consistent, workable process to get more juice from the "image" when that happens, and they don't want to stop yet. <br/><br/>Anyway, this has been a good discussion, at least from where I'm sitting. Thanks for engaging!<br/><br/><br/><sub>By the way, and I don't know if this important to you (or anyone else) at all, but just in case it is, that short paragraph you wrote is perfectly, totally, 100%, an exact (but more metaphorical) restatement of Forge concepts. I like your formulation, though!</sub> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11946/heres-where-the-lines-are-for-me-indie-trad" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11946/heres-where-the-lines-are-for-me-indie-trad" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/11946/heres-where-the-lines-are-for-me-indie-trad/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F11946%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F11946%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
