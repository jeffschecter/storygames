I'm here to share with you my first Monsterhearts skin, The Kirin. The Kirin is an earnest sort looking for someone to put up on a pedestal and devote themselves to. They're also a mythical creature from Asian mythology who punish the wicked and reinforce the right of rule. It is often called the Asian unicorn.<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/170BWRT_krXlFeDt8kgB22AIZVzydMY05di7Id5IHoPc/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/170BWRT_krXlFeDt8kgB22AIZVzydMY05di7Id5IHoPc/edit</a><br/><br/>Feel free to make comments here or on the draft. I have two more skins in draft form to share, but would like more poking at this one to see if I learn anything I'd want to apply to them before sharing them as well.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424011/#Comment_424011" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-10T00:14:54+00:00" title="November 10, 2013 12:14AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like a lot of the ideas, but the first thing that bugs me is Cloud-Walker and Fiery Passion and A Clear Conscience; specifically, that the moves are just powers you do, without a hard-written fictional trigger. When exactly am I rolling with Dark/Volatile with those moves, just whenever I want to use that power? Especially with A Clear Conscience it's a bit confusing when it happens. I feel like there may be an opportunity to have those moves interacting with the drama of the situation, rather than just when you use the power.<br/>Another bit that weirds me out a bit is that it does a lot of defining what happens on a failure. It can be occasionally useful to make something specific happen on a failure, but that's a very rare circumstance - it's often much stronger to simply have the failure allow the MC a Hard Move as usual. The suggested ideas may be worth mentioning in a message to MC (such as the Under the [Playbook]'s Skin notes in the book), but it might be more valuable to free up the possibilities on a failure.<br/><br/>Another thing I noticed is that "Ley Lines" is pretty dependent on "Judge and Jury". While there are ways to put conditions like pure and unworthy on people without the latter move, it makes Ley Lines very, very situational. Plus getting it to work at all requires relying on multiple stats, which is tough. The Ghost has something similar with the Blamed condition, but I'd argue that situation is a little different because the move that creates that condition is automatically given the Ghost.<br/>"A Clear Conscience" is another avenue to 'unworthy' but causes the same situation - Ley Lines is hard to use if you pick it first. "Protector of Innocents" is sort of in the same situation as Ley Lines, but is mitigated by the inclusion of an alternative, so that's better, and a potential solution to Ley Lines' issue.<br/><br/>Speaking of stats, there's 2 Cold moves (as Hold Steady is Cold), 2 Dark moves, and 1 Volatile move. You sure you want the stat line to be H-1/C-1/V+1/D+1? It might be better to go with H-1/C+1/V-1/D+1, and not just because of the moves; the feeling of the skin feels like it's lending itself much more to quietly judging people and turning your nose up at the unworthy, rather than violently lashing out and such. They do that of course, but Volatile doesn't feel like it fits the themes of the skin as well as Cold would. That's very subjective though.<br/><br/>Basically, everything looks like it WORKS, but that there's some work that could be done to ratchet up the drama it generates. Giving a skin a couple moves that are literally just the ability to do certain powers of that monster tend to be pretty commonly added, but are actually quite rare in the MH book itself (one excellent example is The Ghost's Dissipate), and when there are moves that are just giving you special powers of the creature, they only become rolls when they enter a social situation (such as with The Queen's Streaming; you can always her emotions and stuff, but honing in on a single person's thoughts ie making it personal and social turns it into a roll). An example of how to do this would be to change the trigger of, say, Cloud-Walker to something like "You can walk on unstable surfaces. With concentration, you can even walk on clouds and smoke. When someone sees you doing this, roll+Volatile (why is this volatile?)". You just give the power, and make the move about the social situation.<br/>But overall, when would you expect players to use Cloud-Walker? What benefit does this move really give them, and what in what contexts does it become useful? If it's more peripheral, you might even just be able to let all Kirins just do it. The same thought process can be applied to Fiery Passion (btw, why is this Dark? This is totally Volatile, or maybe even Hot based on the condition it confers).<br/><br/>A relatively easy change would be in the Backstory: instead of having been watching someone to judge them, why not have been watching them and have already judged them to be pure? Kickstarts the action a little more strongly.<br/><br/>I could probably say a bit more, but I think that's the main point: everything works okay, but it could be helpful to consider how exactly everything fits into the communicative drama of this very very social game, and how the most drama can be squeezed out of each move on its own and in conjunction with others. I've mostly only been critiquing here, but I want to repeat that in general I like it! It has a good theme that manages not to overlap with other ones too much (I think), it's an interesting monster with some cool quirks to play with, and I'd be interested in trying it out sometime. I'd also be into seeing those other draft skins you've got - even if they're in a more unrefined/incomplete state, no harm gettin' some feedback early on (plus I'm curious what monsters you're tackling - I'm unfamiliar with most of Asian mythology, so seeing skins of them is pretty educational for me, cuz if nothing else it gets me to google the creature).<br/>Heck, there's been a few pretty interesting Skins from Asian mythology, I'd be interested in seeing them put together.<br/><br/>Cool stuff, looking forward to seeing how this shapes up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cucumberkappa" title="cucumberkappa"><img alt="cucumberkappa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/116/nSJOZL6HNH7NS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cucumberkappa">cucumberkappa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424043/#Comment_424043" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-10T21:41:30+00:00" title="November 10, 2013  9:41PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the thoughts! (I really appreciate it!). If I derp and miss the point on something you brought up, I'm not being intentionally obtuse! (Also, sorry for the huge reply!)<br/><br/><br/><b>re: Moves without a fictional trigger</b><br/>You roll if you want to use the "active" versions of the skill. So, no roll to be immune to fire (though the MC might still complicate), but if you wanted to wield it actively, you have to roll and leave yourself open to bigger consequences. You can walk silently, but if you want to try to sneak up on someone by coming up behind them on the lake, you risk splashing into the lake.<br/><br/>I think in earlier drafts some of them did have fictional triggers (I know Fiery Passion wanted you to use the move <i>only</i> in the defense of an innocent/pure person), but I wasn't entirely sure if it would be too limiting. I'm often relying on a player leaning to the heart of the Skin's concept to guide their actions and not just throwing fireballs because it's been a few scenes and nothing was on fire yet. I also want to give Kirin players the options to use their powers upon the command of their chosen leader or in the (misguided) pursuit of "cleansing" (either as their Darkest Self or, y'know, burning down a building because someone "evil" is inside). <br/><br/><b>re: Failures</b><br/>I think I may worry too much about the balance of power. As you observed, some of the Moves are pretty wide open, so I think I may get too caught up in the idea of making certain that they know there are consequences for failure - so they should be sure they want to try. I could pretty easily move some of the failure consequences to a "under the skin" document (which might help me on my word count concerns too!). Are there any in particular that you think the failure condition is unnecessarily stated? (Ley Lines' failure condition could easily be moved to the UtS document just as a reminder that the MC shouldn't just have it fail unless there's a reason for it.)<br/><br/><b>re: dependance on conditions</b><br/>It may just be my group(s), but we don't tend to take advantage of conditions much, so having an excuse to give a condition that might be useful to a Skin might get people more used to using them. I find that they're fairly underutilized in Skins in general, so I think this was really just my way of playing with them. Would adding an alternative for Ley Lines along the lines of "you can always track your chosen leader &amp; consorts" help? The reason I left it off of this one was to give the other players the option to take themselves "off the grid" of the Kirin - or even for the MC to use fiat to remove a pure/unworthy condition from a PC if they wanted to get them on their own. Ley Lines as written is pretty powerful, so giving a sort of hobble to the skill (especially in early sessions) seems necessary to me.<br/><br/><b>re: Stats</b><br/>I think changing Volatile to Cold might work better. I was operating under the assumption that "Volatile" was for physical moves and "Dark" for magical ones. But as I was reminded with one of my other drafts, that's not necessarily necessary. So I may change some of them around now that you've pointed this out to me! Let me toss you my thoughts to see if it changes yours.<br/><br/>I had "Cold" used in Judge and Jury because I figured the Kirin would be the type who found it difficult to stay cool. They're pretty passionate - which in this case, I interpret as falling all over themselves to show physical proof of their devotion (Volatile), not passionate in the Hot sense. So I was sort of setting them up to be more prone to fail to judge people silently. <br/><br/>Assuming you (and anyone else who wanders in to give their thoughts) still think it'd be better to switch stats around, I can do that. Instead of changing Volatile to Cold, it might really be better to switch Dark to Cold and have the magic be based on their analytical side. (That would make Fiery Passion a Volatile roll and Clear Conscience a Cold roll.) <br/><br/><b>re: Cloud-walker</b><br/>My concept for the Kirin is twisted. Their chosen leader may be good (and if they are - the Kirin is a source of temptation... how far will they go with taking advantage of them? how long will they tolerate the Kirin's devotion and plans for them?), evil (how far can they push the Kirin past their comfort zone before the Kirin turns on them or someone comes after them both?), or amoral. But in all cases, the Kirin has to consciously resist doing whatever it is their leader wants them to do. If they resist and fail, they only make it easier for their leader to control them. So I look at all of their powers with the idea of, "If their leader was in trouble, what would be useful?" and "If their leader wanted them to do something, what would make the Kirin useful enough to tolerate how full-on they are?"<br/><br/>So, for Cloud-walker... I see it as being useful for several things (sneaking tasks and rescuing tasks, mainly), but I thought it was rather too powerful to just "give" it to them by default. I thought that the gradual increase on how amazing it could be would help rein in the ability some. They are technically supposed to be able to fly, but since I read accounts of where they were meant to walk on grass without bending it and walk on water, it might be better to go full wuxia and wire-fu it. I'd personally be more interested in a scene where my chosen/consort were at the top of a burning building and I knew that if I could just manage to use the rising smoke to reach them, I could save them... if only I could roll high enough....! than a more social situation where I'm "caught" using my powers, something happens. If you have any more specific suggestions, I'm totally open to them - but I'm just explaining where my head was. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><b>re: Fiery Passion</b><br/>You asked, why use Dark? As I said above, I chose Dark to use for "magical" things. If I were to change stats around, it'd probably be Volatile. I don't really see the Kirin as being passionate in the more physical sense. So, yeah, I'm kind of being cruel to the Kirin by giving them the condition "hot and bothered" because it'd make them easier to seduce - which is interesting in a fiction sense because of their Sex Move.<br/><br/><b>re: backstory</b><br/>I did think of having them start off with someone already chosen, but the idea didn't work for me. It would certainly jump right into the action, but gave the Kirin less reason to interact with the other PCs... or NPCs! Considering that once the Kirin chooses someone, they're going to devote themselves to that particular character and would have to have more of a reason to involve themselves with others, I figured giving them an entire session for their player to make connections to the other PCs and for the MC to have the option to put down "Kirin bait" in the form of an NPC candidate would be better. It doesn't stop the player from deciding that the person they got the Strings on is the person they chose, though. (And would probably be a wise idea considering how much power their chosen leader would have over them.) <br/><br/><b>re: Other skins</b><br/>This is the only one I (currently) have from Asian mythology! Well - directly, anyway. I'm also working on "The Summoned" (Bloody Mary, with Hanako-san being the closest Japanese equivalent, and also inspired by Hell Girl along with Candyman, Beetlejuice, and Smiley) and "The Starborn" (not intentionally based on any source material, but I think more based on the real world equivalent made "monstrous".)

Thanks for the completeness of the response, it definitely gives some more context your decisions.<br/><br/><b>Without a Fictional Trigger</b><br/>I see what you mean. I'd still argue that they should at least be <i>written</i> with a fictional trigger, even if that trigger is wide open, as it makes the prompt clear, and also implicitly says that fiction comes first, then you move into rules text, which will then lead back into fiction - without that prompt, it's easier to move to rules-first, a mechanical impetus rather than a fictional one. Plus it's just more standard to read for people who know the game already <img alt=":3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/blush.png" title=":3"/><br/>Even if it just read something like "when you try to spit fire at the wicked, roll +...", then it's more standardized to read. Though personally I'd avoid "when you TRY" things and go more for something like "when you spit fire at the wicked," that's not required or anything, I just think it's a little firmer.<br/><br/><b>Failure</b><br/>There's a couple bits. I wouldn't worry too much about the game's balance, you can get away with a lot. Players will realize awful quick that their failures have consequences, even without a written piece - hard moves do it on their own often enough. The biggest reason to NOT have them is that they can actually confuse over whether a hard move should happen. For example, with Mandate of Heaven, when you fail the other player takes a String, but is there ALSO a hard move, or is it just the String? Because if it's the String, that's actually potentially <i>less</i> consequence than the hard move.<br/>Another reason would be that the hard moves, as highly adaptable as they are, are much easier to lead back into the fiction. If moves should be triggered by fiction, resolve mechanically, and lead <i>back</i> into the fiction, leaving things at "they take a String on you" isn't really moving the situation forward, it's just a mechanical representation of the situation that's already happened. It's missing that last step of leading back to the fiction, it's left at the mechanical resolution.<br/>That's not so much an argument against failure clauses so much as saying that they need to be very carefully used, as hard moves are really REALLY good for bouncing the move's situation back into the fiction, so coming up with something to replace it is tough. On this count, while I'd say that the one on Mandate of Heaven and Judge and Jury could use some work, the one on Ley Lines is actually good! It provides an explicit result of failure that returns to the fiction in an obvious way, and still allows the MC some wiggle room - the latter bit could probably be removed entirely, replaced with something as simple as "but the journey will not be simple", as that also puts things into the MC's hands in the same way, while still being more player-facing. And the journey won't be simple - failing makes it so.<br/><br/><b>Conditions</b><br/>Oh, I'm totally into depending things on conditions. The trouble is that several moves are basing their entire usability on a condition primarily granted by a non-required move, essentially forcing an order of selection.<br/>There's no real great solution for this. I think it might work with the condition and perhaps another way to allow its function, but the alternative is tougher to make true, making the condition a priority but still allowing the move to be work easily if you haven't already taken Judge And Jury.<br/><br/><b>Stats</b><br/>I see how you could come to the Volatile=physical Dark=Magical conclusion, especially based on the basic moves. But they're really about personality, about the frame of mind you're in that creates the move.<br/>I can see your rationale about the moves for stats now. With Judge &amp; Jury I can understand Cold pretty easily, and understand why you'd have a Cold move as a set-you-up-to-fail thing. I confess: I'm personally not a fan of moves where it's a thing you're bad at just because you want to fail.<br/>On that front, I'm almost tempted to say that the move might not even need a roll. If you you burst it out, they take the condition. If you judge silently, they don't take it (but maybe you get something else or some such). Especially if they have the other moves, there's an incentive to burst out, which I imagine is really the goal here. I'm actually not that into giving the condition without telling anyone, mostly because of my understanding of Conditions. Our conditions are the social perceptions of us, and if someone just keeps their opinion completely to themselves it's not really a contributor to their behavior. Of course, there's precedent, again with the Ghost's Blamed condition, so you're definitely not wrong or anything, it's just weird to me personally given my understanding of conditions.<br/><br/>And yeah, Clear Conscience is cool as a Cold move. I think in a perfect world it feels Dark still to me (as it's about wallowing in your own mind about the fact that they lied to you, rather than coming out and calling them on their shit, which happens to be  growing up move so I totally think it's cool to keep it in your mind), but it's super easy to rationalize Cold as well, and I think it would help the skin overall.<br/><br/><b>Cloud-Walker</b><br/>Interesting...<br/>Hmm, perhaps meet the issue halfway in-between. My bug is that just doing it in non-critical situations can go a long way to making you really FEEL like the Kirin, and in those more ordinary situations a significant risk would be not only irrelevant, but would actually discourage from using that cool trick in narration and stuff. Maybe in the middle there's a "With significant concentration, you can walk on unstable surfaces like mist, smoke, and water without falling. When you try to do so in a stressful situation, roll+Cold." To me the "when you do it under pressure" is a bit of a cop-out on the creativity side of things, but it's certainly effective. That way the failure only is a problem in a case where it really matters, and lets you do it normally. Also, it's Cold cuz you're trying to keep calm and collected and all, which is fitting with the skin.<br/><br/>The trouble with the situation you described is that, in a situation like that "ruler is atop the burning building" the move actually breaks a bit - what if I roll and get a 7-9? 7-9 is a partial success, but what I needed was a 10+ to be able to climb the smoke and stuff, so the 7-9 isn't actually any success at all, it neither moves the fiction forward nor triggers a hard move.<br/>(also the getting caught or something was just an example I threw off the top of my head, there might be some other circumstance that causes the roll - my point was just that it be hopefully more social in nature, though it doesn't have to be).<br/><br/><b>Fiery Passion</b><br/>Fair 'nuf - I figured it'd be Volatile, I just also could have seen it work as Hot. Volatile overall is better for it.<br/><br/><b>Backstory</b><br/>Works for me! I can see where you're coming from with it now. Though I would personally make the candidate always a PC, that's mostly just personal bias because I only really do 1-shots, so we get fairly limited NPC interaction as we're all playing hard at each other since we're not looking long-term. I totally get why you'd allow it to be an NPC.<br/><br/>As for the other skins, just wanted to mention that though I've only taken a cursory glance, their concepts both have some really interesting bits. (I really like the underlying foundation of Urban Legend especially, in particular the setting establishment, it seems super-fun to toss into a 1-shot).<br/><br/>Looking forward to getting time to give a close read of the other two, you've got me intrigued!
