Either one GM, one Player, or something GM-less that works with just 2 people.<br/> . . . with a really snappy "elevator pitch."  Something that I can explain in just a few sentences have have my friend "get it."<br/> . . . with really fast, easy character creation.  I'd like to be able to give the pitch, make characters, and be ready to fly in 5 to 10 minutes, tops.<br/> . . . with relatively simple mechanics.  I don't want something completely free form, but I'd like something with rules that can either be explained easily in the course of play, or that can be added to the end of the pitch and character creation without pushing the time past the 10 minute mark.<br/> . . . that can be played to a satisfactory completion in one shot.  3 to 4 hours, tops.  If it takes a little tweaking of the normal game to make this happen, that doesn't bother me.<br/><br/>suggestions?  i've got a few games on my shelf that i think could probably work for this purpose, but i'm curious to hear what other people think.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_157945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/157945/#Comment_157945" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-22T14:27:39+00:00" title="July 22, 2008  2:27PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Trollbabe is often recommended in these contexts.

But if someone wanted to hack it a little for a 2 player game, it probably wouldn't be impossible. If you focused on a more positive relationship between a master and slave it could be interesting. So say you had an old widow who lived in a city with her equally old slave. An old white woman living alone with no family close by is quite vulnerable, and would have to rely on her slave more and more as she got older. Have the slave and mistress be related. Give the slave the chance to escape with ease, but give her the moral dilemma of leaving her mistress alone and unable to care for herself, so she might face institutionalization, being taken in by abusive family members, etc. Blur the lines of who has the upper hand in the relationship. I think you'd have to tweak the rules to make it work, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158085/#Comment_158085" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-23T08:03:31+00:00" title="July 23, 2008  8:03AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have a game in playtest called <i>Showdown</i> which is designed for two players to play in about an hour.

I haven't run or played it yet, but I think it meets everything I'm looking for with the possible exception of being really good one-on-one.  It SEEMS like it would be solid one-on-one though.  Has anyone played it that way?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Parthenia</cite>If you focused on a more positive relationship between a master and slave it could be interesting. So say you had an old widow who lived in a city with her equally old slave. An old white woman living alone with no family close by is quite vulnerable, and would have to rely on her slave more and more as she got older. Have the slave and mistress be related. Give the slave the chance to escape with ease, but give her the moral dilemma of leaving her mistress alone and unable to care for herself, so she might face institutionalization, being taken in by abusive family members, etc. Blur the lines of who has the upper hand in the relationship. I think you'd have to tweak the rules to make it work, though.</blockquote>Julia, this sounds super cool!  I imagine that many/most PCs in an SAJ game have a goal of gaining their freedom, so one of the big questions is probably just how much freedom is worth to them and what they are willing to do to get it, right?  I love that this situation would still ask that same question but in a very very different way.<br/>I have to admit that I have not yet read all the rules for SAJ.  I read about half of it one night then was distracted, probably by something shiny.  How much / what kind of rules tweaking would be necessary to make that work?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158088/#Comment_158088" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-23T08:20:55+00:00" title="July 23, 2008  8:20AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: chearns</cite>Kazekami Kyoko Kills Kublai Khan</blockquote>Hmmm . . .
