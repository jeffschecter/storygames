He really has two inspirations for this: two dragon sourcebooks (Council of Wyrms for AD&amp;D, and Draconomicon for D&amp;D3.0); but more importantly, a lot of reading of Knights of the Dinner Table comics.  <br/><br/>He's played a number of one-shot RPG sessions with me and at conventions, though has never been in an ongoing campaign.  He likes Monster Island, Once Upon a Time, and the PS238 RPG - while his favorite game thus far has been Hellcats &amp; Hockeysticks.  He also has played a fair bit of the 4th edition D&amp;D boardgames (mainly Wrath of Ashardalon), along with Magic: The Gathering and Talisman.  <br/><br/>So he's looking for something with dragons, and possibly reminiscent of Knights of the Dinner Table that I'd run for him and his cousins this summer.  (Two of his cousins play 4th edition D&amp;D.)  I'm pretty rusty at this style of play, though, and at this point the field is quite thick with D&amp;D versions/editions, OSR games, along with various spinoffs like Dungeon World.  For them, the mechanics should probably be semi-close to 3.0, 3.5, or 4th ed D&amp;D (where they have the most familiarity), but much simpler and also well-designed.  It should support some tactical play, but I've got nothing against either player metagame control bits or high GM discretion.  I don't have a specific thing I'm looking for - just something good that they'll like and I'll enjoy running.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381113/#Comment_381113" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-06T23:26:38+00:00" title="June  6, 2012 11:26PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do you think he'd deal with character death? Most 12-year-olds I know would find it super-hard to deal with a beloved character dying.<br/><br/>If that's the case here, I'd avoid almost any edition of D&amp;D except 4th, and that's a LOT of work for a DM, in my experience.<br/><br/>I'm having a lot of fun with my Basic D&amp;D hack, but it prominantly features frequent character death, which is probably a bad fit for you.<br/><br/>Something like Savage Worlds or similar might be a good option. It's got lots of fairly well thought out mechanical bits for the players to fiddle with, and it's a lot less finnicky with challenge-level than any edition of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Another option is to choose D&amp;D, with some in-game conceit or out-of-fiction rule that removes the problem of character death. In that case, I vastly prefer 3e to 4e, but it's basically a question of taste.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381120/#Comment_381120" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T01:39:47+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  1:39AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So John, what style of play are you rusty at?

My choice of system was based on what I was most familiar with - thus I don't have to think about the mechanics and can focus more on him.<br/><br/>It actually turned out to be a great choice due to the "random generators for everything" nature of the rules. I play with zero prep and just use the random dungeon creation and treasure rules from the book. He actually prefers this mode of play to doing old-school modules I found on the internet - the simple wander around, kill monsters, take their stuff is fine with him.<br/><br/>I have character death as I felt it was vital to the experience *however* I also have a limited form of troop-style play and no TPKs. He has 2 main characters, rolled as per the rules. He also has occasional hirelings and is fond of buying dogs (though they have a terrible mortality rate). In addion there are 2 NPC adventurers with their own 2-3 men-at-arms hirelings that he hangs around with.<br/>When one of his main PCs dies (and they have!) a new 1st level one is rolled up, due to even XP distribution this secondary character quickly catches up in abilities. Death has been hard but we have worked through it.<br/><br/>I also doubled the rate of XP gain compared to the rules as I felt that he could be bored otherwise. He has made it to 6th level in several weeks of play so I am happy with the rate.<br/><br/>I play all combats on a grid, IMO sufficient tactical stuff is all there and more sophisticated systems are unnecessary - an interesting fight is one where the PCs have considerations beyond simply defeating the monster and the dungeon crawl resource constraints, wandering monsters and XP rewards tilted towards treasure do this nicely.<br/><br/>I totally agree that DW could work too (in fact its probably more natural for people with no RPG experience). I still think that making you comfortable is most impt, then you can focus on feeding the kids what is working for them.<br/><br/>rgds<br/>rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381125/#Comment_381125" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T04:21:24+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  4:21AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hacking D&amp;D to address the potential character death issue is super-easy.<br/><br/>When your HP are reduced to zero you are knocked out and come back to your senses with a GM-set condition on you like Lost, Trapped, Robbed...<br/><br/>Think of hp more like Disposition from Mouse Guard and less like actual hurt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381134/#Comment_381134" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T05:09:12+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  5:09AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some XP with this.<br/><br/>Been playing Dungeon World with 5-12 year olds in my extended family and it works fine so I'd recommend this.

The character sheets are pretty friendly for folks who are culturally exposed to D&amp;D or have actually played. The game contains lots of interesting little tactical things: simplified management of gear and food (which is it's one little game), combat, and most important fictional position tactical game. I don't know your kids so I can't really comment on how they would handle character death in DW. A quick hack for Last Breath would be just assume everyone is always rolls a 10+ or make a custom Last Breath move. You can run as no prep/low prep game. And if the sheets are overwhelming I have one I cobble together as part of a DW demo. <br/><br/>Further from 3rd edition<br/>Storming the Wizards Tower - lots of fun tactical stuff here, character sheet is friendly, need lots of d6's<br/><br/>Ryuutama - It's all about the journey, exploration, and hanging out in awe inspiring places. There are lots of things of tactical importance in this game but combat isn't one of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381178/#Comment_381178" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T08:38:43+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  8:38AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Weeks</cite>I find the concern over character death here really interesting.

NGR is a fantasy heartbreaker RPG; it does what you would expect out of a traditional fantasy role-playing game. While NGR will work as a complete game I have no doubt it will rarely be played as such; This game is designed expecting that you will most likely see things in this game you would like to remove and plug into your own game rather than playing it whole cloth.<br/>\nThis game is designed to simulate low magic fantasy, but most mechanics are equally at home in a science fiction, action or post-apocalyptic game. The rules are designed to be as setting neutral as possible while solving commonly held gripes and bad tropes. In the writing of this game I used the following as guiding principles:<br/>\n 1.) Funny dice are fun on their own merits<br/>\n2.) Choices to make are better than problems to solve<br/>\n3.) You are already familiar with role playing games<br/>\n4.) You are not looking for gritty realism, but do enjoy the presence of the \u2018fourth wall\u2019<br/>\n5.) Gaming is meant to be entertainment"<br/>\n<br/>\nGive it a shot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381182/#Comment_381182" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T08:49:27+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  8:49AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My son hasn't dealt with RPG character death, but he's pretty good about losing in board and card games.

I haven't GMed anything remotely D&amp;D-like for many years.</blockquote>\nSo it sounds like you need as much help with campaign design as with system picking.<br/><br/>I was doing this about a year and a half ago and found that when I went through a bunch of old D&amp;D modules that I found online, several of them were a lot of fun. I put together a little sandboxy spot that consisted of the following:<br/><br/>For overall theme, I used a fall of the Roman Empire style setting, except set in a world where fairy tales were real. So fantasy races were replaced with related talking animal story equivilants - Orks were Porks, as in the 3 little pigs. Bugbears were just talking bears, and a family of them was looking for a blonde thief girl.<br/><br/>The Village of Hommlet was the home town. I went through a text version and added names to all the NPCs. I used medieval English job names, so it would be an educational experience - the man with the last name Cooper was the barrel maker, etc. The moathouse outside town was an initial badguy hideout.<br/><br/>The "haunted" alchemist's house from Secret of Saltmarsh was downriver. If they'd finished it, it would have been riverboat smuggling rather than ocean smuggling.<br/><br/>The Caverns of Chaos mines from Keep on the Borderlands were in the nearby mountains. Because trade routes were failing and ore supplies were dwindling, the local magistrate wanted to reopen the old mines.<br/><br/>I had plans to use a few others, but we didn't get that far before schedules changed and the campaign peetered out.<br/><br/>I'd suggest keeping everything local and close to town. The constant wandering trope keeps the PCs from establishing long term relationships with NPCs and, I think, makes things less interesting. Long term relationships mean consequences for actions - if you hose someone in town, people remember.<br/><br/>For system, I used a slight tweak of Savage Worlds. It does fun tactical combat well, plus gives fun non-hitting options that work both in and out of combat. Social engineer characters are very useful and functional, even in a high combat team, which I think is an exceptionally good feature.<br/><br/>The only big thing I don't like about Savage Worlds is the long skill list that results in lots of "unskilled" checks. So I replaced the wild dice roll with a Stat + Job roll similar to Leverage RPG. I came up with 6 jobs that reflected the setting \u2013 Woodsman, Soldier, Noble, Servant, Witch, Scoundrel. I placed the Savage Worlds skills into a chart with stats across the top and jobs on the left. I added a couple other skills that fit the setting, like Dancing (Cinderella, etc) which turned out to be used a lot \u2013 it got used a couple times as a Balance type skill. I gave them a range of die types to assign to the Stats and Jobs. They\u2019d roll both dice (exploding) and keep the 1 highest. Because of the tweak, they did a little bit better at the things they were good at, but not enough to feel broken. I made more things require multiple successes because of the tiny bit of dice inflation.<br/><br/>Also, I replaced the coin economy with a huge item list I found somewhere online that I liked a lot and only had to tweak a tiny bit. It gave a really good sense of what things were worth, and felt nicely realistic. The farmers and craftsfolk of town had a solid income, but also had taxes and expenses, so they didn\u2019t have lots of cash on hand. Monsters and brigands had some treasure, but not tons and tons. It worked out so that a successful adventurer would make more than a successful farmer or craftsman, but certainly not enough to throw a whole village\u2019s economy out of whack with one night of partying and spending their loot. And because they were focused on one location, they had reasons to want to buy a home (they were looking at buying the rights to the alchemist\u2019s run down house from Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh and fixing it up) and pay taxes and such. Overall, the economy felt good. I had some sketchy simple encumberence rules to go with it. Basically you could carry like 2 weapons and one suit of armor equipped. If you carried extra armor or weapons as loot, they were in your hands (unless you had a cart or something) and would be in your way if a fight broke out. And if you were carrying more than a few hundred coins, it would get heavy and obnoxious, so storage or gem trading were good options.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381267/#Comment_381267" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T14:10:12+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  2:10PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, Rob.

It just means you have to go back to your last save spot from 5 minutes ago and try again a different way.<br/><br/>That's huge, night and day different from "Your character is dead. They're not coming back. Make a new one. Lose all the leveling progress you've made."<br/><br/>My 10 year old doesn't play his games on HARDCORE!!! mode, where the difficulty is cranked and you can only die one time. He tends to turn the difficulty level down, so he can run through, nearly invincible, and slaughter bad guys. He doesn't care that he's removed the challenge part. He's happier without it. Interestingly, he tends to start games over repeatedly, rather than playing them through until the end. I'm not positive exactly why. I think he likes playing the early levels over and over because they are easy and fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381351/#Comment_381351" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T21:53:23+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  9:53PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The kid's 12.

There's a bunch of small supplements if you're not wanting to read a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381397">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381397/#Comment_381397" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-08T07:19:07+00:00" title="June  8, 2012  7:19AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy beat me to this but in the Stuff to Watch Luke talks about Moldvay.

It does work as reviews of modules B1, B2, B3, and B10 - which is potentially useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381768/#Comment_381768" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-10T20:11:16+00:00" title="June 10, 2012  8:11PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/jhkim">@jhkim</a> well you have three really good choices to pick from <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Pathfinder has a lot of module support and the Beginner Box is pretty awesome. <br/><br/>Between Moldvay and LL I would choose Moldvay. Moldvay has a better define structure for dungeon bashing, it is shorter at 68 pages, if you speak AW the principles of Moldvay are  here:<a href="http://www.latorra.org/2010/09/28/the-principles-of-moldvay-dd/" rel="nofollow">latorra.org/2010/09/28/the-principles-of-moldvay-dd/</a>. Any adventures written for LL can be used with Moldvay. The GM's rules are pretty well laid out.<br/><br/>The choice between Moldvay and Pathfinder is just a matter of taste. I think either would work fine for what you want. I am partial to Moldvay because I find it easier to stat up creatures , faster to generate characters, and focuses solely on dungeon exploration. <br/><br/>ara                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381782/#Comment_381782" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-10T21:46:07+00:00" title="June 10, 2012  9:46PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Pathfinder beginner box is effin' awesome.
