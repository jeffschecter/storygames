As a last step, I take my notes and what I've figured out about the system, and try to condense it into a small packet of information I can hand to players that they can refer to during the game.  I probably learn the most from making the packet, to be honest.<br/><br/>After the first session of actually playing, I review the stuff that didn't go so well, and figure out what I forgot/got wrong/didn't explain properly/need practice with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295117/#Comment_295117" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-29T04:46:32+00:00" title="September 29, 2010  4:46AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Read it.

Correlation or causation?</blockquote>\nYeah. This. I used to buy every game that I thought looked interesting, but then I wound up with games on my shelf that I can't see myself ever getting to play. Anymore I've limited myself to buying games that meet both of the following criteria: 1) I've played at least a demo (preferably a con game) 2) I can reasonably expect to be able to play the game.<br/><br/>A recent example: Brennan demoed How We Came To Live Here for me at GenCon this year, and I really liked it and thought it was super-interesting. However, since most of my gaming gets crammed in on weeknights over Skype, I didn't buy it because I just didn't see how HWCTLH would work over Skype.<br/><br/>Of course, I make a few exceptions. See: Apocalypse World. I didn't manage to get a demo at GenCon but I bought it anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295230/#Comment_295230" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-29T14:02:32+00:00" title="September 29, 2010  2:02PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Unless a book tells me otherwise, I will skim it and if it seems possible... run it right out of the book. <br/><br/>Sometimes we will split responsibilities. In Shadowrun, one person was in charge of understanding combat, someone else magic, someone else decking, and so on. In one of my groups, one person DMed D&amp;D 4E and another arbitrated rules. Although a few of my groups may be unique in that we've known each other for a long time, almost all of us have GMed, and we sometimes split the cost of game books. <br/><br/>My preference is that you can run a game step by step straight out of the book and if there are parts that require special prep or study, the book explicitly says so. It's hard to do! Which is one of the reasons I'm excited when I can try. I want to learn the best way to present information one piece at a time. I admit that my preference is partly informed by my work in hardcore usability testing. <br/><br/>In general most people (maybe not most roleplayers) jump back and forth between reading instructions, trying to use something without reading all the instructions, jump back to reading more instructions, and back to using it without instructions once they think they know enough to get by and only stop when there is an obvious problem. This isn't always efficient (although it can be) but none the less it is common.<br/><br/>That said, if a book can't be used this way and I'm GMing, I will read everything I think I need to before we play. But I don't want to commit more time than I have to since I play with a lot of different people and what we play frequently changes. I won't know if we are playing 1 session or 10 till we start. <br/><br/>I have been told that you can't run an RPG unless you read every single page multiple times and understand what and how the designer intended those rules to be used. But when I've played with people who have claimed to master a game, they sometimes get rules wrong! Funny enough, sometimes what they got wrong worked really well! Ultimately if a game requires that you know more than the average person can reliably remember, they should provide easy references or there is a usability problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_295232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295232/#Comment_295232" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-29T14:14:45+00:00" title="September 29, 2010  2:14PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>But when I've played with people who have claimed to master a game, they sometimes get rules wrong!</blockquote>\nI get the rules to my own games wrong all the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_295238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/295238/#Comment_295238" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-29T14:31:23+00:00" title="September 29, 2010  2:31PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 29, 2010 2:33PM by jenskot.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha!
