I corrected two or three minor grammatical things, but otherwise it's very clear.<br/><br/>How many players do you need for this game? I might try playing it with my family.<br/><br/>Two comments:<br/><br/>1. The section where you create facts and items was confusing, and I had to reread it several times. Is the idea that, after creating the suspects, you each come up with two of these? I think this could be clearer. "Take two turns each" is potentially a little confusing.<br/><br/>[Edit: I read through it a second time, and now it made perfect sense as written. Not sure if this is good or bad!]<br/><br/>2. You don't put periods after titles (like "Mr." and "Mrs."). Is this intentional? Technically, it's incorrect.<br/><br/>3. Is it necessary to write down so much of what is said? It sounds like a lot of writing to do.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I like the image of a player being the assistant to the detective and taking notes, like a Dr. Watson to your Holmes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433460/#Comment_433460" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-05T15:56:05+00:00" title="June  5, 2014  3:56PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2014 4:40PM by Rickard.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wanna thank everyone so far for the corrections.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>: check my <a href="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/TheMurderofMrCrow_RickardElimaa.pdf" rel="nofollow">earlier version</a> because it could be that the text is clearer with a more visual layout. That's partly why I'm writing this game, to learn to describe rules with help of images. The main difference from the previous version and this one is how you write down the facts. The relationship map that I first had in mind became too cluttered.<br/><br/>To answer your third question, it's sadly necessary to write it all down, otherwise it's hard to keep track of it all. The idea of having an assistant actually came from one of the playtesters.<br/><br/>As for the first question. Do you think it's still unclear if you looking at the layouted version?

The Detective ask up to three questions,"<br/><br/>This is an error. How about, "The Detective will ask three questions"?<br/><br/>* "The game is over. Discuss what you have accomplished, and what to be changed upon next time."<br/><br/>Grammar trouble. How about: "What MIGHT/SHOULD be changed next time."<br/><br/>* "If the same Suspect appears more than once during the draw, ignore it"<br/><br/>Why is this? Wouldn't this be an interesting opportunity for drama? Add more details to make them seem more guilty, or maybe make an argument for why they're innocent, or have them reveal some kind of twist. What's the logic here?<br/><br/>* "Tie the suspect together to something on the paper"<br/><br/>This is just awkward grammar.

It's like when you frame a scene. The players can't move in the scene unless you say the place. If you want to do a large narration, leave the place to the end. I wonder if not mentioning the place until after the suspects have been created may create a difficulty to understand the game. That's why I placed the apartment at the beginning and then repeated it before the actual play will begun.<br/><br/>If you will play the game, try what I wrote by leaving out the place until later. And try to say something like "We're on a  space ship" instead of an apartment and see how the rest of the group will react. They will probably have an option about that, don't you think?<br/><br/>I think, if I get a chance to play the game again, I will try this myself. I also believe that changing the setting will change the motives, so it's important to even mention it. One motive could be about an alien life form, if you're on a space ship, and what kind of motives would be created if the game would take place in a mansion during the 1890s? I toyed around with expectations from a setting with <b>This Is Pulp</b>, where you start off by choosing between, and later creating tropes in, different land areas. South America will give inspiration to a lot of different tropes than China.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433717/#Comment_433717" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-11T13:36:54+00:00" title="June 11, 2014  1:36PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good idea.

I thought that reading that <i>incredibly</i> inspirational text could be a kick-off to actually start playing. To break off from, or create a pause between, spawning suspects to actually talk to them.<br/><br/>I could probably restructure the whole thing but then I also need to rewrite the text. If I had When &amp; Where before The Suspects, I think that would lead the group to believe that they are about to play the detective right away. At least as how it's written now.<br/><br/>If I take a step out of me as the game's creator: it may seem like I'm shooting down all of your ideas but I realized that this game is rather complex. A lot of things depend on each other, not in a mechanical way, but in a social and "learning" way. Like why the die should be rolled in the open. I think the ideas are sound in how the game is built and explained, but the ideas can be executed in a lot better ways.<br/><br/>I agree that the whole setting thing in You sounds off, especially when it should be about the detective. But I don't really want to bunch together the same information on one place, because repeating is a good thing. That's why I, for example, mention the assistant twice, after the actual headline. That's why I got the different results of the die roll to start off with the same sentence. This is something I learned from feedback from previous games, and now experimenting with.<br/><br/>So see this game as a learning curve for me, and I really appreciate any kind of feedback in how you interpret my text, and where your thoughts went - like why anyone should roll the the die in the open. Feedback like that gives me a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433725">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433725/#Comment_433725" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-11T15:03:18+00:00" title="June 11, 2014  3:03PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rickard,<br/><br/>I can see what you're going for, and it's a good idea.
