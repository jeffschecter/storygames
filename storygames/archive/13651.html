I am just curious to see how many others on here know what MAGfest is and if they attended this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also one guy in particular that I met and would love to continue a friendship with. His name is Pete, he had glasses, some facial hair, he was wearing a NILE shirt when I met him, and he was slightly a heavyset man. If he happens to see this, all I have to say is BROMANDUDEBOY. That should be enough for him to remember who I am.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308699/#Comment_308699" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-18T19:20:25+00:00" title="January 18, 2011  7:20PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good luck finding your fella!<br/><br/>I'd love to hear more about MAGfest - it looks like it is primarily a video game oriented meetup, is that accurate?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MollyxEdge" title="MollyxEdge"><img alt="MollyxEdge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/hs354.ash2/63439_470442347692_501592692_6244879_4099219_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MollyxEdge">MollyxEdge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308703/#Comment_308703" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-18T20:29:05+00:00" title="January 18, 2011  8:29PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Magfest is a video game, arcade, console, music, nerd convention that costs 45 dollars, or less with group discount. It occurs every year in January, in Alexandria, VA. It's always a TON of fun and I've always had a great time. They have tons of table top game tournaments, movies, a LAN room, live music, panels, conferences with people such as John St Jon (Duke Nukem). I ran into Pete just by wandering around. He was sitting there doing nothing and had cards for Danger Patrol sitting on a table, I asked about it, and he got EXTREMELY excited. He told me all about it, so we gathered some other people and started playing. I was a two-fisted warrior named BroManDudeBoy, this is all besides the point. MAGfest is amazing and very very fun. I found out this year that their limit is 3,000 people, so you should register as soon as you can, I'd recommend registering a few months before January 2012, just to secure your spot.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would like to see/learn more, you can just go here, www.magfest.org                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308744/#Comment_308744" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-19T09:49:01+00:00" title="January 19, 2011  9:49AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Might I suggest <a href="http://magfest.org/forum" rel="nofollow">http://magfest.org/forum</a>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308745/#Comment_308745" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-19T09:49:19+00:00" title="January 19, 2011  9:49AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Err, to find Jeff, that is?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308746/#Comment_308746" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-19T09:49:49+00:00" title="January 19, 2011  9:49AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Um, Pete.

Lucky for me, he used his real first and last name, found him on Facebook and we have now rekindled our almost-lost nerd friendship. We've discussed hanging out during PAX East this Spring, as I am moving to Boston very very soon and my boyfriend loves doing photography at conventions.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut once again, I disgress. I think if you are in the Virginia/Maryland area or have some extra spending money come January 2012, you should definitely check out MAGfest. Though, it caps out at 3000 people, so you might want to get tickets/rooms a few months prior to January.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_308863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TheWhaleShark" title="TheWhaleShark"><img alt="TheWhaleShark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TheWhaleShark">TheWhaleShark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308863/#Comment_308863" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-20T14:31:52+00:00" title="January 20, 2011  2:31PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 20, 2011 2:34PM by TheWhaleShark.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm the Pete that Molly's talking about. I ran two back-to-back sessions of Danger Patrol (over a course of, I believe, 6 straight hours) for two groups of 11 different people total.<br/><br/>When I finished, I explained, broadly, the concept of "story games," and directed interested people to this community, to learn more and so forth. Aside from that, Molly was way into Danger Patrol, and I know John Harper is on these forums. I figured the best way to get really into a game is to talk to the developer himself!<br/><br/>Hey Molly. Glad you enjoyed the games and tracked down these forums. It's a cool place.<br/><br/>On the topic of MAGfest, I think it's a good venue for indie developers to introduce their stuff to people. I would say the con is about 80% video game focused, and the tabletop presence is largely board games and D&amp;D. However, every single person I encountered in the tabletop area was also ravenous for new games. There is also the huge advantage of the con being 24 hours, so you don't have to worry about fighting over table space or fitting into rigid time blocks. Just get some people together, find some space, and play!<br/><br/>I highly recommend a strong story game presence at this con. You'll find some new players. Also, it's fun!<br/><br/>EDIT: Also, if you're interested in pushing your games out to a convention crowd, my friends Rym and Scott of <a href="http://frontrowcrew.com/" rel="nofollow">Geeknights</a> "fame" do several panels about story games and RPG's that are beyond D&amp;D and the usual suspects. Give 'em a shout out and they might help you plug your game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_308897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/308897/#Comment_308897" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-20T22:47:53+00:00" title="January 20, 2011 10:47PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hunh.
