                    In the thread <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=255&amp;page=1#Item_15" rel="nofollow">Thought on Stakes Setting</a> there was the beginnings of a thread about setting counterstakes in Dogs. The rules don't indicate that there should be any counterstakes (and that's how I've run all my games so far), but in those game I have thought a few times that having counterstakes gives the NPCs something to "raise toward", which I think would help. I was going to test out counterstakes when I run Dogs for a new group next week, but then Joshua BishopRoby has said that they are <i>poison</i>.<br/><br/>So I'm creating this thread to ask opinions on counterstakes in Dogs. Should I set counterstakes? If not, why not, if I should, then are there any pointers I should take on board with regards to setting them and so forth.                </div>

<p>Counterstakes generally?  I'd have to think about that.</p>
<p>But I can say with some certainty that stakes that <em>imply fallout</em> are poison to Dogs, and counterstakes have a strong tendency to lead people to that mistake.</p>
<p>"If I win we peacably get past the man to talk to the Steward, if I lose we have to fight in order to get there" is poison <strong>not</strong> because of the counterstakes, but because the stakes are phrased in terms of fallout and escalation.  The right way to make those stakes is to say "If I win we get to see the Steward, if I lose we don't" and then let "peacably" and "fighting" be resolved by escalation.</p>
<p>Primetime Adventures works <em>best</em> when you say "Okay, we know we're going to achieve the goal, the question is what it costs us to do it."  Dogs gets broken if you import that same mentality into setting stakes, because it should be handled by escalation and fallout (especially since fallout can be way more than wounds ... new relationships, changes to traits ... all sorts of great stuff).</p>
<p>Now if, by comparison, someone said "My stakes are that Sister Temperance marries young John" and the GM said "And if you lose, she runs off with the handsome stranger Rudolpho" then I'd say <em>"Alright!</em>  Now we're settin' some solid stakes."</p>
<p>Does that distinction make sense?</p>

                            Counterstakes should be about what the GM expects his NPC's to do if they win, not what the price for the PC's would be if they lose.  The first is stakes; the second is fallout.                        </div>

                            Ah yeah, that makes sense. The same way as the players shouldn't set Stakes that imply "method", and go for just a desired outcome, the GM should set counterstakes within those same restrictions. Cool.<br/>
<br/>
Just bouncing some examples to try and test the boundary conditions: If Tony's example "If I win we get to see the Steward, if I lose we don't", we set counterstakes of "If I win we get to see the Steward, if I lose the Steward hightails it out of town" instead, that would be OK, yes? (In your opinion; of course my group could and should discuss things if it came up in play). How about "If I win we get to see the Steward, if I lose the Steward throws us all in the town's jail"? Does that come close to implying fallout? I'm not sure.                        </div>

                            Being thrown in jail would be very similar to the "sit out the next conflict" fallout, so yeah, I would hesitate to set that as counterstakes.<br/>

Counterstakes might be "If you lose, the Steward starts a follow-up conflict where he wants to..."                        </div>

                            In my experience counterstakes aren't poison in Dogs. However, they are difficult enough that they're not usually worth futzing with. The reasons for this are three: <br/><br/>1) You have to make sure your counterstakes don't force fallout. As others have said above.<br/><br/>2) You have to make sure your counterstakes don't force PC judgement or curtail their moral authority. If you have the stakes "I want to convince her that lesbianism is wrong" and then the GM counterstakes "And if you lose she convinces you that it's right" you're going to someplace interesting -- but not somplace that works for Dogs. (In Nine Worlds, for example, I do sometimes have stakes like that. In Dogs its death.) <br/><br/>3) Countersakes can have a way of killing good followup conflicts. Look at the "If I win we get to see the Steward, if I lose the Steward hightails it out of town" example. Is the Steward already out of town? Shouldn't they get a followup? If they do get a followup why bother with the counterstake? Now if you phrased it "We want to see the Steward before he leaves town" and you lose, then it's easy to see that the logical followup is something in the range of "Damnit, now we have to track him down in the wildnerness." <br/><br/>I don't think that counterstakes inherently force any of these problems, but IME they do make them common enough that using them is not worth the price of admission. Dogs works best with flat stakes, giving lots of freedom for fallout, moral judgement, and followup stakes. <br/><br/>I'd also speculate that this is because Dog's punctuated conflict resolution is not the same as PTAs single conflict scene and dispute resolution, but that's an argument for another time.                        </div>

                            Yeah, good points. I certainly hadn't considered #3, and I think that followup conflicts are an important part of Dogs play, and as such shouldn't be restricted.<br/>
<br/>
I think I've been "sold-off" of counterstakes (in Dogs, anyway). But my original motivation for using them was to give my NPCs something to raise towards. Is there any way of providing that focus, or is it all just playing from what that NPC wants from the Dogs?                        </div>

                            Tony, <br/><br/>Yes. <br/><br/>And the fact that you can do that is another reason there isn't a lot of point in doing counterstakes.<br/><br/>As to the quesiton of giving NPCs something to push towards -- just have them push. Take what they want to take, and if the Dogs don't want them to take it then the Dogs have to call a conflict to stop them. <br/><br/>An NPC who wants to kill a Dog, for example, just leads to the GM saying, "He's going to kill you." At which point you've got a pretty firm certainty the Dog's player is going to say "oh hell no!" At which point you roll dice.                        </div>

                            In my book, NPCs only need one thing to raise towards, and that's what they want from the Dogs, as set in the Town Creation rules.  If you're running a conflict with an NPC that isn't part of the sin hierarchy and thus doesn't have a "what I want", you need to ask why you're running that conflict in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Brand rather admirably summed up most of what I would say (not surprising, since we just had this conversation regarding our own game).  While I did originally say that they were "poison" perhaps it's better to say that there are too many ways for counterstakes to become poison, and not very much gained when they don't.  As Brand said, it's not worth your time.                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>The interesting thing about raising towards what the NPC wants is that sometimes you can't. You have to find ways of manifesting it at a remove. That or you have to be really careful how you set them in the town writeups. <br/><br/>Because if the NPC wants the Dogs to say that she is innocent, or to go away and leave her alone, you can't just make the stakes "say she is innocent" or "go away and leave her alone." Same deal with "convince them my niece is a good person and let her love that cute girl she's dating."                        </div>

                            Lemme clarify.  NPCs don't have stakes to raise towards.  They have Dogs' stakes to raise against.  And they raise against those stakes according to their "what I want from the Dogs" descriptor.<br/><br/>Now, admittedly, this doesn't always work, and sometimes you do get a meaningful conflict with a guy who's not in the sin hierarchy, and sometimes you do have to set things up at a remove or a dodge or whatever, but as a very broad basic principle, that's the first thing that you should be thinking about when doing NPC raises.

<p><code>Same deal with "convince them my niece is a good person and let her love that cute girl she's dating."</code></p>
<p>Imagine the Dogs set stakes of "Get the Steward to spill what's troubling him," and your very first Raise (as Steward) is "My niece doesn't have anything to do with this!"</p>
<p>They're all like ... "Niece?  You have a niece?  What are you even talking about?"  And then somebody claws their way back into character and says "Well, Brother, I don't rightly reckon we asked about your niece, but as the topic seems to be weighin' on your mind, let's discuss her," and raises back with some God-awful combination of dice.</p>
<p>Now you're playin' Dogs, that's my opinion.</p>

                            Cool - I really like your last example Tony. It was that exact kind of situation I had been struggling with before. I would have just done a Raise of something like "Get out of my house!" or somesuch, which is OK once in a while, but did get a bit "bland" I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have this great tool to use, which I'm sure will be both Good and Big :) And yeah, counterstakes seem unnecessary now.<br/>

                            I don't think you need counterstakes at all in Dogs.  Remember that NPCs can call for conflicts and set their own stakes if there's something they want.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite stakes was from a fantasy Dogs game, which had magical instead of gun-fighting.  The character was confronting a sorcererous Harlot, and I start with "The stakes are: do you fall in love with her?  She's starting at Magical."<br/>
<br/>
Counterstakes are really useful in games where only the players can challenge.  But Dogs isn't one of these games.<br/>

                            We've just started playing Nine Worlds, and so far, I like the way stakes are set in it better than Dogs. It's a clearer procedure, and the way that lines of opposition are explicitly set up is more elegant, imo. However, I wish 9W had something like Fallout in it.                        </div>

                            Tony, Ben, <br/><br/>Yep. Pretty much that. <br/><br/>The love conflict is an interesting one. On one hand it forces feelings onto a Dog. On the other hand, being in love doesn't neccesitate any specific reaction. All it does is let us see how the Dog judges the woman he's in love with. Will he shoot her in the head the same way he did the whore in the last town? <br/><br/>Either way though, I think the counterstakes don't help and aren't needed. Better to stick to followups.                        </div>

I think NPCs can set stakes that directly screw with the character's judgement, as long as it has to do with what the NPC wants from the Dogs.  I really like to idea of "the stakes of this conflict are: do you think I'm innocent?"<br/>
<br/>
Ooh!  Ooh!  The stakes of this conflict are "Do you give up being a Dog?"  This would be a great use for Vincent's my will + your heart follow-up idea.<br/>

                            I never realized this so far.  I've grown so used to automatically setting stakes/counter-stakes that it never even occurred to me that it would be different in Dogs, but I DID notice the fact that escalation and follow-up challenges seemed to happen far less in our games than in actual play reports I've read.  This might explain it.<br/>
<br/>
I've also really tiptoed around initiating challenges with the players (I'm always the GM) to determine things like "do you think I'm innocent?" or "do you give up being a Dog?"  In fact, I generally try to give the players the option to start conflicts and not push my own unless they absolutely refuse.  Maybe I should start being more forceful.  Does anyone have any experience with conflicts containing stakes like Ben suggests above?  How'd they go?  Did they function well without counter-stakes when initiated by the NPC?  I ask this last, specifically, because it seems that fallout plays less a role when it's the GM that has to take it than when it's the player, so I wonder if it's as satisfying to engage in that sort of conflict without counter-stakes.<br/>

I wouldn't use "do you give up being a Dog" as a stakes without a little bit of rules-hacking (essentially, allowing a follow-up conflicts along the lines of "I kill you" conflicts.)  So be wary about that.<br/>
<br/>
NPC initiated conflicts have worked out really well in my experience.  One thing which I think is great is having an NPC come up "Oh, praise be to the King, the Dogs are here!" then start a conflict with the stakes "do you help him?" without saying what sort of help he wants.  Boy, that sets them on edge...<br/>

That's way cool, I'll have to give it a try.  I once initiated a conflict with a player re: if his Dog would sleep with the girl who was trying to seduce him, but I asked him about it first and wasn't planning on doing it without his consent.<br/>
<br/>
I've got a lot of baggage that keeps me from doing those sorts of things, but I recognize they can be neat and challenging and powerful.  Thanks for the advice.<br/>

                            Ben, <br/><br/>Could be. I suppose it really depends which you're wanting out of the game: higher drama or more of a chance for the players to make the moral judgement. Because if you mechanically force the Dog to say someone is innocent, it sure can make for an interesting story, but it also sure does screw up the players ability to make a moral statement. <br/><br/>I must ponder. <br/><br/>(I've done it both way in AP, btw, and both have problems and rewards, so that isn't hugely helpful.)                        </div>

If it's a challenge, though, and the Dogs don't want to say the person is innocent, don't they have the power to fight that?   Isn't that making a moral statement, particularly if they're willing to escalate in order to say it?  And isn't saying it different than believing it?<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that a lot hinges on the context of the challenge, which isn't too helpful either.<br/>

                            Daniel, <br/><br/>Sure. But they can lose the challange no matter how hard they fight. <br/><br/>Admitedly that doesn't happen often in Dogs, but it does happen. I've killed Dogs dead in games when the player was tyring as hard as they could to not be dead. <br/><br/>Though one could ask if being dead doesn't so something to your moral authority too....                        </div>

Sorry, yeah.  That's the way I was looking at it.  The challenge for death impairs a character's moral authority more than the challenge to make the character declare someone innocent against their will, at least in the long term.  So I'm looking at these two challenges on one hand and thinking "Yeah, they look pretty equal to me" and on the other hand, I'm made a little nervous by any challenge that intrudes on that my-guy area.  I'm trying to determine if that's legit, or if it's just baggage I'm carrying around from other gaming.<br/>

                            Funny, Vincent and I just discussed this: in Dogs, there are no counterstakes because that's what Fallout does. In Shock: each participant declares an Intent. If I want what I want more than I don't want you to get what you want, I do one thing. If your Intent is something I don't want, I spend my resources in another way. One, both, or neither of us can get what we want.<br/>
<br/>
This is because the fallout system is minimal, though; the Intent of each character is "fallout" that's strictly contextual.                        </div>

                            Daniel, <br/><br/>There is a difference that can be drawn between death and being forced to make a judgement in Dogs, however. Dogs never says you won't die, but I do sell players on it as being a game where they get to make moral judgements. <br/><br/>So killing em is fine. Making them not be able to make the judgement they want to? Maybe not so fine. <br/><br/>Joshua BishopRoby,<br/><br/>Have anything to add from your perspective? Like about the time I made the stakes of "Leave me alone and go see the Mountain Folk" for the guy who hoped you'd shoot them full of lead and how that fits in to this discussion?                        </div>

                            Ben, foisting conclusions on the Dogs (this one's innocent) is one of the reasons I try to avoid counterstakes and even (despite it being blessed by lumpley) allowing NPCs to start conflicts with their own stakes.  <em>For me</em> Dogs is all about presenting a situation that the players then make conclusions about via character action.  The GM forwarding his own conclusions and backing it up with the System, while perfectly acceptable in other games, is counter to Dogs play in my little world.  If that floats your boat, well, go forth and rock the world.<br/><br/>Brand -- killing characters does not negate the player's moral authority.  In effect the statement is "I believe this to the point that I'll die for it."  In fact, such a martyrdom would <em>increase</em> my sense of the moral statement being made, not decrease it.  But again, that's my own headspace.  Your headspace may vary.                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>Killing a character as part of fallout, sure. But what about starting the conflict as the Dogs ride into town with the stakes "Does he kill you" as someone in the town who knows they're a sinner trys to abort the Dog's mission of justice? At that point the Dogs don't have stake yet, other than that they're dogs. And they can't exactly give out either.                        </div>

                            Ok, modification to my thougt. Remember, everyone has to agree the stakes are fun whether they are won or lost. So if Fred doesn't think it will be fun for his character to be killed, or resign from the dogs, then stakes forcing such are not acceptable (which is different from forcing him to choose between taking a gunshot or giving a conflict, and losing the stakes).<br/>
<br/>
And remembering this, I don't see any problem with NPC initiated conflicts. They're just a case of the GM saying "I think we have a conflict here." How the players go from not in a conflict to in a conflict is always up to negotiation. And it's worthwhile to note that players should be able to ask for a conflict also - sure the GM can "say yes" (or roll the dice), but the player should be able to say "no, I think there's a conflict here."<br/>
<br/>
Dogs works incredibly smoothly if you remember all of this. I was amazed at how smoothly the game ran by just observing when the players wanted conflicts, or they were needed for pacing.<br/>

Thanks, that gives me some stuff to think about.  I think I'm coming to the conclusion that either option allows you the ability to make moral statements and fight for them, since you're engaging the conflict resolution system in either case, but that the context for the conflicts (particularly those initiated by the NPCs) is extremely important so the players don't feel betrayed.<br/>
<br/>
My players (who tend to be new to Dogs and similar games) have a tendency to be reactive rather than proactive, so I use NPC initiated conflicts like bangs.  I'm excited by the prospect of putting the Dogs and players on the defensive by making them defend their beliefs as much as leaving them on the offensive by allowing them to enforce their beliefs, I just don't see any clear markers as to where I should draw the line yet.<br/>

I'm pretty much driving the indie game revolution around here, single-handedly, so it's slow going.  I've got a couple folks who are just amazing, a few folks who are really trying, a number who just don't get it, and some who aren't interested and falling by the wayside.<br/>

<p>Huh.</p>
<p>Brand and Joshua BR -- You do realize that "I kill you" conflicts aren't actually "I kill you" but rather "I force a relatively easy follow-up healing conflict?"  (Likewise, if I was actually going to use equivalent stakes like "you give up being a dog" I would have a relatively easy follow-up inspiration conflict.)  So, frankly, the best response to an "I kill you" challenge is to <em>give</em>.</p>
<p>As to the innocence conflict -- I think it raises a whole passle of great moral issues.  Will you punish a person you believe to be innocent if other people believe that she is guilty?  Will you punish someone you believe to be innocent if all evidence points to their guilt?  By not having NPC initiate conflicts you're essentially taking some of the bite out of the game.  Even emotionally manipulative stakes (like "do you think I'm innocent" or "do you think I'm right") don't undercut judgement, they simply open up new realms of judgement.</p>

                            The GM says, "sister Annabelle runs up to you in tears. Stakes: does she convince you that she's innocent?"<br/><br/>Totally legit. Know why? Because we all know she's not innocent - an innocent NPC doesn't launch a conflict with those stakes - and playing my character as a dupe to her wiles is <i>fun</i>. Will he catch on, eventually? How much evidence will he ignore? How betrayed will he feel? How stupid will he feel? That's fun stuff.<br/><br/>What's not legit is "sister Annabelle runs up to you in tears. Stakes: is she innocent?" The GM already knows whether she's innocent. No amount of conflict resolution can change the town writeup.<br/><br/>Re: death and abandoning your calling: also totally legit. Nobody says you get to play your Dog as long as you want to. Maybe you do, maybe you don't.<br/><br/>Re: Frank's "Remember, everyone has to agree the stakes are fun whether they are won or lost": nah. The stakes should be mostly givable, that's all - and that's givable in the view of the most discerning player, remember, not givable in the view of the player whose character's at stake.<br/><br/>For lots of people, playing Dogs where every individual gets veto over the stakes will be a fun, easy and safer way to play. I'm fine with that. But that's not the limit to Dogs' workings.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>

<p>Let me also point something out:  suppose Sister Annabelle wins the stakes that your Dog is convinced she is innocent, and nobody ever convinces your Dog otherwise.  So, because of that conflict your Dog has to believe she's innocent.</p>
<p>Has that compromised your ability, as a player, to judge that what God demands is that you shoot Sister Annabelle in the face, right there in the street?</p>
<p>No sir.  No, it sure hasn't.</p>
<p>Changing what the Dogs think of people doesn't stop the players from deciding what God wants.  The only thing that would change that is if the GM could set stakes about what God wants.</p>

                            Oh, I see where you're going.  Conflicts where NPCs convince the PCs of their innocence, kill the Dog, or convince them to abandon their calling are all "okay" under the assumption that the results of the conflict are overturnable later.<br/>
<br/>
Meh.  I generally play for keeps in Dogs.  There's too much good stuff in there to keep belaboring the same question over and over, switching it back and forth.                        </div>

                            Vincent: How do you decide who the most discerning player is? I know you say in the book look for the person who expresses the most displeasure with stakes, raises, and sees, but what if two people are expressing displeasure in different areas? Of course this goes back to social contract (and remember that GMs can be dicks also).<br/>
<br/>
So I would tend to think that "Brother John (the dog)'s life is at stake" would only come up if the group as a whole agreed that was an ok stakes. If it's just two players (the GM, and "the most discerning player") deciding that, then something's broken.<br/>
<br/>
What's key to me though is not which way any particular group decides to play, but that the game text encourages the players to talk about what they want from the game, and the rules work with the players to achieve their vision. Will all of that stop someone from being a dick? No. Will that prevent a player from being hurt? No. Will it guarantee that if a player is hurt that the player will not be abandoned? No. All of those depend on the people, but at least the rules don't confuse the issue.<br/>

<p><code>Oh, I see where you're going. Conflicts where NPCs convince the PCs of their innocence, kill the Dog, or convince them to abandon their calling are all "okay" under the assumption that the results of the conflict are overturnable later.</code></p>
<p>Was that directed at me?  Because that's not what I was saying.</p>
<p>I was saying that if you as a player decide "Yes, Sister Annabelle is innocent.  Yes, God wants us to shoot her in the face," then I am totally excited about that.</p>

                            Tony, mostly I mean that the conflicts should not absolutely constrain player action in a binding and permanent way.

                            Frank: <i>So I would tend to think that "Brother John (the dog)'s life is at stake" would only come up if the group as a whole agreed that was an ok stakes.

Some groups play Dogs that way - <i>I</i> play Dogs that way - and it works fine. Dogs supports that kind of play. Dogs lays out responsibility pretty clearly, and "discuss what you all want from the game" isn't there.<br/><br/>As GM, you get to say "stakes are: does he kill you in your sleep?" whenever you feel like it. <br/><br/>It sounds like "discuss what we all want" is part of <i>what you personally need</i> for "whenever you feel like it." That's cool, carry on, I got nothing to say about that.<br/><br/>But "discuss what you all want" isn't any kind of universal standard. <i>I</i> don't play that way.<br/><br/>How I play is, as GM I sometimes say "stakes are: does he kill you in your sleep?" and if the dice say (including the medical aid followup) that he kills you in your sleep, friend, he kills you in your sleep.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>

                            I'm thinking of the "discuss what we want from the game" as occuring up front at the beginning of the game, not in the middle (well, unless the up front discussion resolved that we are open to talking about the stakes for each conflict). And I suppose it doesn't need to be an explicit conversation unless someone has a particular concern. And maybe I'm reading too much into what the text instructs.<br/><br/>In other words, I see nothing wrong with the way you play (not that the game author needs any approval from a mere mortal...). And understanding the rules better, I can see that I might use such stakes in the future myself.<br/><br/>Again to me, the key is having a functional social contract. Assuming that, then however you play should be just fine.<br/><br/>Hmm, here's a question (quoting from the text):<br/><i>Also, occasionally, your character will get killed. The conflict resolution rules will keep it from being pointless or arbitrary: itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll happen only when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve chosen to stake your characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life on something.</i><br/><br/>How does this statement mesh with the GM being able to set stakes "Does he kill you in your sleep?" That passage may be the source of my confusion.<br/><br/>This passage:<br/><i>If we lose our charactersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ initiatory conflicts, will we be out of the game? Ã¢â‚¬Å“I hope my character makes it through initiationÃ¢â‚¬Â isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t an acceptable conflict, whatever specific form it takes. We already know that all our characters are going to be Dogs, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the game.</i><br/><br/>Plants a bit of a suggestion that stakes saying "you quit the dogs" would not be expected, though I grant that's only the initiation conflict (where it really would be pretty pointless to have spent all this time creating a character, only to quit after his first conflict).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

Yeah, up front is when to have the conversation. I getcha now.<br/>
<br/>
About death and abandoning your calling: as GM, I feel like trying to kill your character or put him out of the game when it'd be awesome, not when it'd be suck. The GM's job is to test the characters, maybe test them to death, not to kill them capriciously.<br/>

I retract all my strident writing! I think we're on the same page after all.<br/>

                            Tony, <br/><br/>I play that way, currently in half (ie 3) of the Dogs games I play. The other half of the Dogs games don't work that way, due to the situation around the table.
