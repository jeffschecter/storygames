Well...aside from playing with stuffed animals with my sister twenty years ago and one play of Fiasco with my sister and girlfriend last week.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe play of fiasco worked out very well, but I can see how that game needs 3+ players.  I was surfing around looking for RPGs and found Danger Mountain on the Bully Pulpit Games website.  According to the rules it works as a 2P game and given the subject I think it would be fun one-shot game with my girlfriend, who has environmental alarmist tendencies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was just wondering if any of y'all who have played this game (Jason thanks this website in the opening credits!) would have any advice for playing this game.  Any pitfalls I should be aware of?  Is this game secretely really f'in hard to pull off for n00bs?  Is there something I should be aware of when of presenting it to my girlfriend or setting the mood?  Or iarethe rules pretty straightforward (as they seem to be) and really I just need to jump in!?!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance!<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.bullypulpitgames.com/downloads/index.php?file=/free_games/danger_mountain.pdf                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365079/#Comment_365079" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T12:46:34+00:00" title="March  4, 2012 12:46PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Justus, <br/><br/>Remember that Danger Mountain was written in a week and may be a little rickety, even for a bitter old game nerd. I think if your girlfriend looks it over and is excited to play you'll do fine, though - it is definitely no more complicated than Fiasco. I doubt you'll get much advice since I don't think very many people have played it. <br/><br/>As a side note, being a n00b will rarely be an impediment to learning and playing a roleplaying game. There's very little to "get wrong", so I'd encourage you to jump in. I have been playing RPGs for decades and I make rules mistakes all the time, even with (especially with!) games I actually wrote. If you get something wrong and have a good time anyway, well, how wrong were you?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/aaarg_ink" title="aaarg_ink"><img alt="aaarg_ink" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.grizzlypear.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/pepper32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/aaarg_ink">aaarg_ink</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365263/#Comment_365263" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T10:52:06+00:00" title="March  5, 2012 10:52AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the heads up!  Yeah, I think I need to get past my standard boardgamer - WHAT DO THE RULES SAY - hangup and just go with the flow!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI ran the concept past my GF last night and she seemed interested...I think she may be more interested in global destruction, but I think we can start with SoCal before destroying the whole world!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
