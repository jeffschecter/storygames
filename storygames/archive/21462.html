I was never part of the Forge and I feel as though it\u2019s history is getting in the way of bringing in fresh perspectives to advance the discussion of the subject. <br/><br/>The figurative speech and slippery jargon seems to lead to miscommunication and leave little room for gamers new to the language and concepts. By talking about RPGs in this way without much context, instead of talking about these ideas in the most accessible and plain way that is possible, even Forgites sometimes talk past one another and misunderstand what others are talking about.<br/><br/>By using such language and jargon without also grounding it in plain speech and specifics, the conversation gets obfuscated and people have a hard time getting on the same page and actually having a real meaningful, discussion and exchange of ideas. All of this terminology is slippery and people bring their own definitions, contextual understanding, and interpretational preferences the paradigms to the table, and often end up talking past one another. Almost all of these concepts can be spoken of in a more accessible and clear way without losing anything and without added difficulties. And the terms themselves, if relevant and needed, don\u2019t need to be lost, but simply contextulized within more accessible language. For example, are you coming at this concept from a Behaviorist interpretation or a psychological perspective?<br/><br/>Anyway, I feel like the site is less likely to get new ideas and impute and people are much more likely to be misunderstood. And from a financial perspective, it is less likely to create a larger audience. And creating a larger audience doesn\u2019t have to mean that the conversation gets watered down and less intelligent; by charging money to take part in the conversation more regularly, Ron weeds out those that are less thoughtful and meaningfully interested in the subject. <br/><br/>I personally I think there are a lot of people like me out there who are trying to get a better grip on the stuff and would appreciate people taking a little extra time so that the conversation and the ideas become a little bit clearer. Thanks. <br/><br/>What are your thoughts?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469666/#Comment_469666" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-06T19:10:47+00:00" title="February  6, 2018  7:10PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My own experiences with theoretical discussions of roleplaying games that don't use "Forgite jargon" is that they are not intrinsically any more easy to follow or capable of getting everyone on the same page, and often times far worse at it.<br/><br/>That is not to say that the ideas and language of the Forge are the be-all end-all of RPG theory, but I do find that the kind of artificial conceptual framework created by specialized terminology is far more conducive to getting everyone on the same page than assuming that they are all going to share the same subjective interpretation of more "accessible and plain" language.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469667/#Comment_469667" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-06T19:24:58+00:00" title="February  6, 2018  7:24PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff,<br/><br/>In most regards, I agree with you. Ron is particularly prone to using technical language and jargon (he himself invents), which makes his writing very dense and hard to follow. The advantage, though, is that he manages thereby to be very precise.<br/><br/>I think that a call for more accessibility is a really good one, for all the reasons you mention. However, we can't just throw out the utility of established vocabulary between people, especially when it comes about after years of discussion. Without ever using specialized vocabulary, we become much less efficient at communicating with each other.<br/><br/>Vincent, historically, has been really good at using "plain English" to explain more high-brow ideas. Ron has not (and intentionally so, I think). I don't expect him to change his ways now; that would be quite contrary to his character. (I think he values the precision of his own vocabulary too much for that, which is, from another angle, both understandable and laudable.)<br/><br/>What to do about that? I'm not sure. I think you're absolutely right that it would improve the visibility, popularity, and utility of the site.<br/><br/>On the other topic, I'm curious where you see the "confirmation bias" happening among Forge-literate folks. I have no doubt it could be the case - it usually happens in such groups, after all - but I wonder where specifically you see it in action.<br/><br/>To me, the Big Model is generally full of fairly self-evident stuff (Social Contract, for instance). We can find other (maybe better) ways to talk about those, but I've yet to hear someone come up with an argument that refutes them, or even tries. And then there's the more controversial detail, which is the specific Creative Agenda modes "recognized" by the Big Model. Those, it seems to me, are constantly a topic of debate among the Forge-descended crowd anyway, as shown by this current discussion between Ron and Vincent, so it's clear people disagree about the specifics all the time.<br/><br/>Thanks for starting this thread; I think making game theory conversations more approachable, relevant, and easier to understand is a very laudable goal (and particularly important when we see people getting personally offended by those conversations, although why they do so is still a mystery to me).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469668/#Comment_469668" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-06T19:25:24+00:00" title="February  6, 2018  7:25PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron Edwards and Lumpley spent a lot of time and effort building up a big model and specialized language for talking about RPGs.

For example, instead of saying <b>Dramatist</b> and <b>Trifold Model</b>  and leaving a bunch of people out of the conversation who do not know the definition of <b>Dramatist</b> and <b>Trifold Model</b>, or who have there own unique understanding and definition of the term; why not simply write: \u201cI\u2019m mostly interested in the narrative qualities of the game, such as story, a good plot, the exploration of themes, etc. I like games with emergent stories, and I\u2019m most interested in telling a satisfying meaningful story in the unfolding events.?\u201d  If I write like this, there is less room for miscommunication and the what I mean is clear, the context is plain, and is accessible to larger audience. Meanwhile, I probably saved myself time by not having to re-explain things while we talk past  one other.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469671/#Comment_469671" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-06T19:53:16+00:00" title="February  6, 2018  7:53PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2018 8:32PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Jeff,<br/>In most regards, I agree with you.

I would say that the reason we think that the Big Model ideas are held so universally is because we talk to people who typically hold the same perspective. I very much think that the Big Model is the best one out there, but Ron\u2019s new and wonderful ideas about how RPGs are an original, divergent form, similar to literature and the like, show how much room there is to grow, and, whether people think so or not RPGs are in there infancy as a form, and we need fresh eyes and new ideas.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469672">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469672/#Comment_469672" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-06T20:10:08+00:00" title="February  6, 2018  8:10PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2018 9:41PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/DannyK" rel="nofollow">DannyK</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Ron Edwards and Lumpley spent a lot of time and effort building up a big model and specialized language for talking about RPGs.

Ron is pretty much the reason we have the indie games and indie games are the thing that made me interested enough to come back into role-playing. I write abstractly as well, and use the Big Model and Trifold Model as well, but I\u2019m pointing out the advantages of doing so with nuance.  And not obsfucating needlessly, yes it\u2019s an adjustment, yes it\u2019s something we all need to work on, but it\u2019s worth it.

I\u2019m saying because of this we should clarify what we are saying with plain language to the degree that we can.  I\u2019m also saying that many of the things that are said in abstract ways can be made less abstract in the conversation. This isn\u2019t about the Big Model or any of the theory; this is about communication and about making things accessible for new people. This is about not talking past one another, etc. <br/><br/>Regarding the \u201ctunnel-vision,\u201d my point was that it was a tight community and that more view points would be helpful if what we\u2019re after is a great conversation where we can learn from one another. <br/><br/>Put it this way, I\u2019ve been talking to folks on the Story Games forums for over a year, and sometimes I simply don\u2019t understand everything that is discussed on Ron\u2019s new site, maybe because I don\u2019t have the background or because the terminology is so slippery or because things are said in an abstract and idiosyncratic way and everyone has there own definitions\u2014I have an English and Masters degree, so it\u2019s probably not a reading comprehension issue. I\u2019ve tried to learn everything I can about design and indie role playing-games as possible, and I feel as though I\u2019m missing or misunderstanding or misinterpreting a lot of the finer details. I think there\u2019s more people like me out there. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469679/#Comment_469679" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-06T20:50:54+00:00" title="February  6, 2018  8:50PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeff, if your goal is to understand Ron better, I recommend you contact him about that.

If I use twenty different jargon-ish terms, which can be interpreted a bunch of different ways, in 5 minuets, no one will <i>really</i> know what I\u2019m talking about. It comes down to this: do we really think a conversation and the exchange of ideas is worthwhile? If we do, that means we actually have the good-faith assumption that we can learn something from one another and that we can genuinely generate something useful from the discussion.  My proposition is that, if this is the case, it\u2019s probably a good idea to actually put some effort into trying to actually communicate and understand one another. <br/><br/>I really don\u2019t understand why this is so controversial.

If people are coming up with their own definitions, then they're not using the tools for the purpose for which they were designed, and/or fundamentally misunderstanding why they exist in the first place.<br/><br/>This is necessary because, at it turns out, people <i>still</i> have their own definitions and conceptualizations of terms even when they use "plain" language. This is the end result of lots and lots of effort spent trying to "actually communicate and understand one another." It's not about trying to exclude people, it's about making sure that nobody shows up to a soccer match with a bat and glove.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469696/#Comment_469696" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-07T00:34:35+00:00" title="February  7, 2018 12:34AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>What are your thoughts?</p></div></blockquote>\nThree thoughts: the first one is that Ron himself is a long-time proponent of concreteness and plain language. I wouldn't expect him to demand anything else. Him wanting that doesn't make him or anybody he interacts with magically comprehensible to anybody else, of course, but the reason doesn't seem to be willful obfuscation so much as the issues being complex and different people having different expectations of communication.<br/><br/>The second is that ultimately Ron's forum is part of Ron's heroic journey towards the zenith of wisdom. It is no surprise if he is going to be highly idiosyncratic; he has always been when wrestling with difficult concepts. Just read his comics blog if you want to see him writing in a complex and personal way about something generally considered simple. Those who don't feel like trying to follow those trails might do best to wait for any results to surface and get applied; I could not say whether Ron's process still has anything to offer for the scene, but historically he's been of great relevance to at least some of us.<br/><br/>I have some sympathy for Ron on this, because while I think he is often pretty difficult to understand, I also think that he is under no obligation to be easy, and to me personally it's clear that this is part of his creative process. It's not a strange situation to me, I can be very difficult to understand myself when I wrestle with complex issues. I imagine that I'll never forget a lecture on game design that I gave two years ago at a certain Finnish convention - it was two hours of me drawing a diagram and talking about Platonic idealization with terminology that I'd crafted specifically for the situation, because as far as I knew nobody had words for talking about the topic. It was a horrible experience socially because there were like 40 people listening to the lecture, and maybe two of them understood any of it based on the questions I got [grin].<br/><br/>My third thought is that the kinds of dialogues you're reading are very much intended for the participants of that dialogue, not for you or me - if we understand them, great, but the people participating at a forum like the Forge or Ron's new forum aren't there to perform for the rest of the Internet. They're just trying to communicate with each other in effective ways.<br/><br/>The implication of that third observation is that perhaps you would understand Ron better if you talked directly with him instead of following a discussion he has with somebody else. You could ask him to explain anything you don't understand, for example, and he could adapt his way of communicating to your expectations.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I think that the definitions and interpretations of terminology itself is slippery; if we can\u2019t agree on the definition of the terminology how can we understand one another and what we mean or are trying to convey with the terminology? For example, instead of saying <b>Dramatist</b> and <b>Trifold Model</b>  and leaving a bunch of people out of the conversation who do not know the definition of <b>Dramatist</b> and <b>Trifold Model</b>, or who have there own unique understanding and definition of the term; why not simply write: \u201cI\u2019m mostly interested in the narrative qualities of the game, such as story, a good plot, the exploration of themes, etc. I like games with emergent stories, and I\u2019m most interested in telling a satisfying meaningful story in the unfolding events.?\u201d  If I write like this, there is less room for miscommunication and the what I mean is clear, the context is plain, and is accessible to larger audience. Meanwhile, I probably saved myself time by not having to re-explain things while we talk past  one other. </p></div></blockquote>\nI don't know if this was intentional, but your example is very illustrative of why rpg theory uses jargon: "Dramatist" does not mean "interested in stories", at least the way it is used in orthodox Threefold. If you're using it that way, as a way of generically gesturing towards story as an idea, then I do certainly agree with you - do drop the jargon and just say what you mean.<br/><br/>(That's also a good example of what happens when rpg theory uses jargon: people pick on words they like the sound of, and start using them in creative ways. The "technical sense" of terms doesn't last very long in the wild, as hobbyists starved for vocabulary fall upon any new terminology like a pack of hungry wolves.)<br/><br/>However, if you're interested in discussing the precise issue that Threefold addresses (GM decision-making processes), then the precision of the term "Dramatist" (decisions based on perceived dramatic value of outcomes) is potentially useful. Sure, I could use a precise <i>and</i> transparent expression, but what would you want me to do? Insert a small treatise on Threefold every time I want to reference the idea that it is possible to prioritize dramatic concerns in decision-making? It's much less trouble to just use the term and expect others to ask if they don't know what "Dramatism" means.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>A good example was our different understanding of the term <b>Simulationism</b>.</p></div></blockquote>\nYeah, that's an explicitly open theory question. I mean, the correct understanding of what GNS Simulationism is substantively has been debated for 15 years. There would be something wrong with the process if the term itself was somehow fixed in analytical meaning before there is analytical consensus on it. I'm sure we can all agree on that - it's logically impossible to expect a Catholic and a Calvinist to agree on what "salvation" means as a word, when that's the very gist of their disagreement in the first place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469697/#Comment_469697" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-07T00:35:43+00:00" title="February  7, 2018 12:35AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2018 4:50AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, in truth the terms and understanding the theoretical framework aren\u2019t the biggest hurdle. I think that sometimes people who speak abstractly, like myself, do so in a very idiosyncratic way, which they understand, and assume other people understand, but which other people don\u2019t necessarily understand. I have trouble understanding some people\u2019s idiosyncratic and abstract way of speaking,  I think that Ron just happens to be one of these people that I have a hard time understanding. For some reason, the way he articulates his ideas is difficult for me to understand; the problem is, he\u2019s got some great ideas and I want to understand the nuances.  This just happens sometimes. People have different communication styles.

I only have a very tiny horse in this race - came to the Forge pretty late, contributed nothing of use to it, and, while having read most of the Forge articles, none of them stand out in my mind as particularly useful to anything I did after that point.<br/><br/>Still, even though I do not have too high a regard for the accumulated jargon, I do think that something from the Forge is extremely useful (even aside from the games made by people who did think it worth their time); something that I think people who equate the Forge with its jargon seemingly miss.<br/><br/>The Forge had a process of discussing theoretical issues, couched both in the culture of the site and the structure of the forum that made it mandatory to begin every theoretical discussion by either an example of actual play or a problem one hit upon while designing their game. So, yeah, it's fair play to complain about the density of the jargon, but at the same time, everyone involved put as much effort into discussing in concrete terms as they could to get everyone as much on the same page as possible.<br/><br/>The reason the theory emerged at all was precisely, I think, because even as favourable circumstances as possible (grounding discussion in concrete examples; treating other interlocutors as basically honest; dealing with people who have a lot of experience in the matter under discussion), disagreements and misunderstandings still arose. A good bit of the jargon is pretty much there as, heh, metaconversation tags to mark misunderstandings of that sort: "Ah, I see we're talking about different things here, even though we're using the same words. Lets not waste each other's time and move on."<br/><br/>So yeah.<br/><br/>TLDR: The Forge isn't just about an insular jargon; it's also about the process which the community uses to get at things that interest its members. Whatever you think about the jargon, I doubt you'd have seen a better process before or since.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469705/#Comment_469705" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-07T01:46:48+00:00" title="February  7, 2018  1:46AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, brief bit of advice no one asked for, but that may still be useful nonetheless.<br/><br/>Forge theory is basically theory for game designers, and, some experiments aside, largely of games of a particular kind ('Narrative' games).<br/><br/>The theory you get from that is not a taxonomy that divides reality into categories based on consistent principles; instead, it's about getting at that one thing you want that you don't have the words for yet; and about getting that other crap that doesn't matter out of the way.

Of course, to know that another person has experienced it, you need to be sufficiently in-tune with them, and communicate enough, to read their process; it's not sufficient to expose somebody to something that <i>you</i> think is "gamism", you also need to find out if they see the same thing you see.

Then there's a Forge thread where the concept of Constructive Denial gets hashed out somewhat.

Read, play, and make different games, in other words - you'll learn the most that way. John Harper's list of "games any designer should play" is a good example of this mindset.<br/><br/>Second, Ron clearly felt that purely theoretical discussion had all kinds of frustrating limitations. He eventually became more and more focused on grounding all discussions in "Actual Play". He eventually even shut down the "Theory" forums of the Forge altogether, and encouraged people to engage only in discussions of actual, real games being played by real people (as well as design and publishing/marketing, of course).<br/><br/>---<br/><br/><b>A Sidebar on Jargon</b><br/><br/>In a any specialized field, people inevitably start to use shorthand forms to refer to older, longer conversations. This turns into "jargon", which makes communication more efficient, but also makes it hard for others to join in on the conversation.<br/><br/>So, what can we do? The logical, left-brain solution is to make clear lists of terms and to define them very carefully. (As in the Forge Glossary, which should still exist.)<br/><br/>However, that's not how humans process language and develop vocabulary. Most native speakers, at least, don't learn words by reading their definitions in the dictionary. Instead, we listen to others use unfamiliar words, and we start to shape a vague sense of what a word is from hearing it in various contexts.<br/><br/>This means that same word (e.g. Simulationist) can mean one thing in one community (e.g. the Threefold discussion of old) and a different thing in another (when Ron repurposed the word, with a different definition, for the Forge). We can try to avoid this by continuously coining new terms (Ron decided to clarify things by changing the name to "Right to Dream", but it's harder to say/type and unfamiliar, so people kept saying "Sim" instead, which was comfortable), but, ultimately, I think, we just have to get better at communicating with each other.<br/><br/>I would second Dave's excellent suggestion above to approach Ron as some interested in learning and ask him if he could think about making discussion on his site less opaque, so as to more easily attract new voices and newcomers. I bet he would be quite receptive to that - he generally likes to educate and explain, and is very generous with his time in that respect. <br/><br/>(However, it's also *possible* that he intentionally wants to set the bar high, just like with the cost aspects of his site, in order to limit conversation to those who are willing to take the time and effort to familiarize themselves with his mode of thinking. I don't *think* that's the case, but it's a possibility. You'll find out either way!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469751/#Comment_469751" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-07T17:57:35+00:00" title="February  7, 2018  5:57PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2018 5:59PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Jeff,<br/>First, the best way to demonstrate theoretical concepts is through design.

Anyway, as in the past, I think it wise to stick primarily to games and play, to best use my time, being that <br/>gnosis comes, as you said, primarily through reading and studying games and playing them.<br/><br/>The reason for this side inquiry into theory is that I would like to engage on Ron\u2019s site, and I\u2019m sure there are others like me who would like to as well. So I might get down what is essential in Ron\u2019s theory, that which would be useful to my design interests, in order to have the background info to discuss about design on his site.<br/><br/>I will probably take your and David\u2019s advice and post a topic on Ron\u2019s site, and discuss it with him himself.

This idea that you've constructed for yourself about an insider language being a <i>requisite</i> of participation is, I think, largely in your head. Obviously Ron will treat somebody differently if he's a stranger rather than being an old acquaintance, but mostly that tends to mean that he doesn't assume that you know some esoteric theory idea if you've never discussed that with him. If he should start spouting about something you don't understand, you could just ask him to clarify himself. Like a human does.<br/><br/>The best way to engage with old Forgite theory stuff is to ignore it until it becomes relevant to you. If nobody is throwing that stuff at you - and I rather suspect Ron won't - then what do you care? You can easily discuss gaming with Ron without having to deal with Forgite terminology conniptions, as he's a sapient being capable of using all kinds of words, not a computer program.<br/><br/>Also, a personal request/recommendation: don't try to flaunt theory frameworks for no good reason while posting at sites like the Forge, Story Games, Ron's new site... Isn't that just a sad attempt at fitting in? (And in an extremely transparent way, too - actual theory-heads recognize posing from the first sentence.) Looking at the kind of posting Ron's looking for at his new site, why not just write about your game play or game design using your own words? If there was a requirement there for writing a GNS analysis on your topic before submitting it, I totally missed that.<br/><br/>I have a new hypothesis, by the way: is it possible that the standing rules at Story Games could have caused an over-inflated impression of how technically obscure the Forge used to be? Those old posts about how "Story Games is not the Forge" and so on stood for many years at the top of the forum, and there are many gamers who actually know more about the Forge from second-hand admonitions like "this is not the Forge" than from first-hand experience. I don't know how it looks like if you look at the forum archives today, but in my recollection the Forge was always full of discussion conducted in entirely natural language. Much of that discussion was introducing new people to certain common ideas, but obviously it had to be in natural language for it to be intelligible to the people participating in it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Ron Edwards New Website, Forgitism &amp; Abstract Language and Concepts - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21462/ron-edwards-new-website-forgitism-abstract-language-and-concepts/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Ron Edwards New Website, Forgitism &amp;amp; Abstract Language and Concepts - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21462/ron-edwards-new-website-forgitism-abstract-language-and-concepts/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Sorry about that, Jeff.

I heard plenty of similar complaints back when the Forge was still active.  <br/><br/>Personally, I didn't find most Forge topics particularly obscure, but there were a few quagmires that reared their heads over and over.  Mostly creative agenda stuff, GNS stuff, and stuff that's confusing wherever people talk about RPGs (e.g. "immersion").  But also insider uses of terms, like "system" meaning the full play system rather than the intuitive/standard meaning of "rules".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469770/#Comment_469770" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-07T20:00:07+00:00" title="February  7, 2018  8:00PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2018 8:02PM by Paul_T.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1 Eero. Great post.<br/><br/>My take, briefly:<br/><br/>Yes, the Forge was hard to breach, because "insider conversations" (like that video where Ron and Vincent talk about Creative Agenda!) used a lot of technical shorthand. (As Dave says, above.)<br/><br/>However, everyone I can think of (and certainly Ron and Vincent!) were very open to newcomers and willing to speak in language they understood, explain basic concepts, ask questions, and so on. I didn't (and don't) see anyone trying to keep others at bay by veering into specialized technical vocabulary - the vibe was always of trying to help others make their games better.<br/><br/>The one thing that - as Eero says - gets really annoying and really old is people coming in and trying to use unfamiliar terminology in order to "fit in". Most of the time, those people came in with some mangled understanding of a concept they heard third-hand elsewhere on the Web, and, instead of explaining what they actually meant, wanted to wrangle terms.<br/><br/>Ron complains about this in the video, by the way, describing it as a sort of "fetishism", where someone likes the sound of the word 'Simulationist' (or whatever other word) and therefore starts to attach their personal sense of pride to that term. Then, by extension, everything they like about roleplaying must now fit within that term, and if someone says otherwise, boy, sparks will fly!<br/><br/>That alone is one good reason not to think of many of these concepts as being central to a player's identity - "I am a ___________, she is a ___________," in other words. Discussing Creative Agenda, for instance, gets a lot easier once we separate it from identifying a particular player's identity.<br/><br/>That's no fun for anyone. Worse yet, it preempts any actual, useful discussion, because we end up arguing about terminology instead.<br/><br/>Much better to avoid the jargon in most cases, and go straight to the point in plain English, unless you're rehashing an old conversation with someone you know will understand what you mean. (For instance, the term "story game" is pretty much useless if you're looking for something with a firm, explicit definition, but if I'm talking to you, Jeff, and you say "story game", I know what you mean, because we've gone over it so many times that you can productively use it as an effective shorthand with me.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469777">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469777/#Comment_469777" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-07T21:14:55+00:00" title="February  7, 2018  9:14PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2018 9:45PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess it's possible that some people jumped in wanting to show off their theory knowledge or stand up for their in-group, but in the last 6 years of the Forge, I didn't see that.

I feel like assuming that new people who are using this jargon are doing so to \u201cfit in\u201d or to \u201cflaunt\u201d it, is pretty cynical.<br/><br/>Isn\u2019t it more likely that new people assume they understand a slippery term from reading about it, and taking for granted that the way people are defining it\u2014in conversation or on a wiki or whatever\u2014is the way it is actually defined? That they simply think they really do understand the term but that in actuality they don\u2019t, and because they\u2019re not yet familiar with the wider context, they don\u2019t yet know what they don\u2019t know?<br/><br/>Also, isn\u2019t it more likely that the reason new folks are using the verbiage and terms is because the conversation is being expressed in those terms? After all, those terms are relevant to, and the manner in which, those subjects are being discussed, so doesn\u2019t it make sense to try to converse along those lines?<br/><br/>I feel like I went through that process, and I think it\u2019s pretty obvious that I\u2019m not afraid of looking stupid in front of the crowd in order to learn new things. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469786/#Comment_469786" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-08T00:27:11+00:00" title="February  8, 2018 12:27AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 8, 2018 12:36AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>The best way to engage with old Forgite theory stuff is to ignore it until it becomes relevant to you.

If it is, make sure you support that well.  If it isn't, make sure you're clear that it isn't."  I think that's the simplest, most important takeaway from the Creative Agenda stuff.<br/><br/>As for other takeaways, "don't assume that <i>anything</i> in your RPG needs to be the way it is in D&amp;D" was a bit of a revelation for many.  Also, "think about the actual people playing, not just the fictional stuff".<br/><br/>And then having some innovative games out there to play.<br/><br/>I think those are the big ones.

I never knew that the Model was Behaviorist, if that typically isn\u2019t made clear in the original documents, how are you suppose to understand the concepts properly, and why would one assume that it is Behaviorist? Especially, if you just limited your reading to what seemed of immediate interest with regards to the type of games you like. Why would I read an article on \u201cRitual Discourse\u201d if my interest lie in \u201cNarrativism?\u201d Why would I assum that the Behaviorist lense it argues for applies to all parts of the Theory, especially in a concrete matter? And then you were inundated with many disparate interpretations of what these concepts meant on forums like story-games.com, in many instances by people who\u2019d didn\u2019t understand these concepts them themselves. <br/><br/>So I think the reason it\u2019s seems so straight forward is because you have the right historical context. Think about if you were trying to understand the writings of the Behaviorist Phycologists through the lense of the Psychoanalysts, it probably wouldn\u2019t make sence right? If your smart, and went to grad school like Dreamofpeace\u2014and I for that matter\u2014did, it would probably make even less sense because you would be doing a deep reading and explication rather than settling for a cursory one. The context, and the a priori assumptions (inculding First Principles) just weren\u2019t as easy available to us\u2014and when they were available  were often presented in a way that contradicted one other\u2014as they were to people who went through the process historically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469901/#Comment_469901" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-10T16:04:35+00:00" title="February 10, 2018  4:04PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps somebody needs to set up a crowdfunding campaign for a book on Forge theory. Sounds like there'd be some interest in it. Raise enough money and I'm sure you'll find writers for it. Probably won't still get agreement on what Simulationism is, [grin].<br/><br/>I'm probably one of the more committed Forgites here (as in, a student of the tradition), and even I don't think that it's worth your while to obsess over old theory dialogues by people who have continued to hone their understanding since then. If you really care about it and think that there might be something useful for you in the Forge stuff, I suggest making a list of your favourite Forgite theorists and going around, asking them to mentor you on <i>their own</i> thinking. Then engage in a lengthy series of dialogues and practical exercises. That's probably both more useful and more realistic than reading old texts that were never intended as more than dialogue openers, and complaining about how difficult they are to parse when taken out of their context.<br/><br/>(Note that my prescribed treatment for theory envy is to <i>do the exact same thing that we did at the Forge.</i> The outcomes are a distraction from the process. Perhaps somebody could write a book worth reading on rpg theory, but I haven't seen that book yet, and reading the detritus of old debates certainly does not make up for it. As far as I know, the best way to get "up to speed" on the more abstract and wide-scoped stuff is personal creative engagement.)<br/><br/>Regarding behaviorism, I'll note that that's a misunderstanding or jocular exaggeration of Ron's stance, as far as I know. The way I've always understood him when he complains about the psychologization of his theory is that he desires to limit his thinking to empirical hermeneutics of social and creative behavior: he desires to observe, understand and perhaps predict social activity. Being a behaviorist would imply having a complex psychological model back-ending his theoretical work, and that would be precisely the sort of speculation about human cognition that he is not interested in.<br/><br/>But really, you should just ask him yourself if you want to know what he thinks. It seems kinda weird trying to engage his specific thinking by broken telephone when anybody interested could just engage him directly. Ron can be pretty intense socially, but then who isn't about something they're excited about - he doesn't mean to be overbearing (as I understand it - I'm not Ron).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469902/#Comment_469902" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-10T16:22:32+00:00" title="February 10, 2018  4:22PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 10, 2018 4:37PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I understand Eero and will do so. The point was to help clarify to Paul why Dreamofpeace could find such subject matter confusing. <br/><br/>As per my conversations with David, etc. I\u2019m not sure that a deep dive into the Forgite Theory will do me much good or is a good use of my time; so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be pursuing that route. The theory that is most applicable to design, which is my main interest (that is praxis, not academic masterbation) is largely to be found in the games and play produced by the Forge and the games that have a evolved past these initial ideas. The reason for this post is first as a sounding-board to get feedback so I can properly orient myself and figure out the right path forward;  if I had a premature conversation with Ron we\u2019d probably just be wasting each other\u2019s time.<br/><br/>So this is the reasoning behind the continued discussion.

For instance, it's not a shock to you, I think, to say that roleplaying is a conversation, or that a GM's tasks can be distributed amongst a variety of players (and therefore GMless design is possible), or that a game can be designed which leads us to construct good stories on the fly, and so forth. It's not a shocker to say that "System Matters", or that games can be designed to support different playstyles, which may, in turn, support different creative interests between people. It's not super crazy to say that roleplaying can be seen as a creative or collaborative idea, either!<br/><br/>All of these were huge controversies when the Forge started up, at least for a large portion of the RPG population. I got into a long-running argument with a major RPG figure (the publisher of an RPG magazine I used to game with regularly), for instance, back in 2006 or so, and he was adamant that roleplaying, as an activity, could not be done, categorically, without prep. "A prepared adventure and a formal character design carried out before play are cornerstones of roleplaying - without them, it's a parody," or something of the sort, he said to me, and I never managed to convince him otherwise.<br/><br/>The part that confuses people tends to be about the specifics of Creative Agenda, and that's largely because a) it ruffled the feathers of a million souls around the internet, who started to use the terms in their own, usually entirely different ways, and b) it isn't really (I would argue) all that well understood or agreed-upon by most of the people talking about it (with the exceptions of people like Ron and Vincent and Eero, who hashed it out in great detail over many years). <br/><br/>That would be like reading a handful of forum posts on quantum physics by random strangers on the internet (half of whom are totally bullshitting) and expecting to have an understand of the nuances of how it all works. <br/><br/>(I'm not trying to suggest that Creative Agenda theory is in any similar to quantum physics, by the way; just that the language around is somewhat opaque, the concepts sometimes counterintuitive, and that lots of disagreements remain except perhaps between experienced experts in the field who have discussed and studied for years. I followed a lot of stuff on the Forge, for instance, and I still found out in the last year or so that my understanding of Creative Agenda theory was somewhat heretical! Surprise! It's not an uncommon thing. But the specifics of Creative Agenda are a very, very small part of the Big Model.)<br/><br/>I remember spending months at a time reading articles and discussion on the Forge and constantly *still getting it wrong* - for better or for worse (well, almost certainly for worse), that's how it is.<br/><br/>I'll repeat my earlier advice, with Eero's excellent admonitions thrown in:<br/><br/>* Read, play, and design games.<br/><br/>* Engage people whose thinking on games you value in conversations about it.<br/><br/>* Don't worry about the specifics of any jargon until and unless it becomes useful to you.<br/><br/>As a distant fourth point, I've tried to send you some very basic and simple resources on this topic, including various links in this thread. Those are a good starting point for questions! (Finally, let's chat next time we have the opportunity to speak instead of typing; I may have some clarifying points for you!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469919/#Comment_469919" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-11T00:32:12+00:00" title="February 11, 2018 12:32AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2018 12:32AM by Jeff_Slater.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/><br/>Very cool <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Those are some great suggestions.

I imagine that most American states have something similar, for economic competitiveness if nothing else. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state" rel="nofollow">The welfare state</a> has a vested interest in helping people get to their feet, so to speak, so whether it's finding a job or starting a business, there is support available if you want and need it.<br/><br/>I absolutely cannot imagine that Ron wouldn't qualify for various sorts of cultural funding either, if he was interested in pursuing the Swedish grants system now that he's residing there. At least here in Finland I've never had any particular issues with selling rpgs as high art. If you can get money for organizing a circus school for kids, then why not a gaming club? If a theater production, then why not a rpg book?
