Burning Empires is a comic series with a big setting, I understand.  And Falling Blossoms - well you don't get much more setting heavy than something based on history.<br/><br/>Falling Blossoms is a really good guide, and I think it's easier in a setting heavy game.  Because Burning is about finding out the issues the story is going to address. It only creates the setting it needs to fufill that, and most of the details end up being other characters (although Burning Empires does explicitly create a whole planet too).<br/><br/>Focus on first picking the general story for the potential campaign. In oWoD Werewolf, here's how I'd start: <br/><br/><b>End of Days</b>: The signs are about and the Apocalyse is coming. Flesh out questions here along the lines of: What are the forces of the Triad up to: Wyrm minions, Weaver agents, and Wyld things? What does the prophecy say about the last pack? The players are this pack, what is their totem? What powerful elder pack is jealous of these young upstarts? What caern do they all call home? What immediate threat does the caern face? Why is the current sept leadership powerless against this threat? Etc.<br/><br/><b>Garou Nation</b>: This campaign is heavy in the politics of the Garou nation, although is probably locally focused with a sept or three in a broad area. This isn't about the end of the world, but the wounds in Garou society and whether they can be healed.  Classic WoD, although not necessarily classic Werewolf. Questions should focus on creating multiple factions, and giving PCs connections with them all, positive and negative and especially ambivilant.<br/><br/><b>Crimes of Our Fathers</b>: This is about one of the seeds of the Werewolf history coming back. What is it? It could be an old tribe thought gone, or existing tribe(s) acting out from past wounds, or war with the Changing Breeds, about the Delerium, or some spirit aggressor. Similiar to End of Days, except it's not about the world ending. It's about the Garou ending from their past misdeeds (which they may or may not be able to absolve). Questions should connect the PCs to this problem much more directly than their wolfblood heritage, as well as connecting NPCs to both sides of the issue and to the PCs.<br/><br/><b>Guardians of the Last Places</b>: Small focus on a sept and a caern and the trouble it faces. A mix of End of Days and Garou Nation, except all the problems are implicitly local. A bit of nWoD flavor, in that protecting their territory is the focus. An arm of Pentex might be the bad guy, but the solution is to stop them at home, not go to Pentex HQ across the country and slaughter the board of directors. Questions should flesh out the local color, not just the werewolves and enemies, but human and wolf connections, and otherwordly stuff.<br/><br/><b>Wolves Among Sheep</b>: This is like Guardians of the Last Places, except that it's not about a big problem the caern faces. It's about Garou life. How they balance their service to Gaia and their natural existence as either humans or wolves. There can be a mix of all the above elements, threats to the caern, or Garou, and especially political issues, but the focus is not Garou society. The focus is on the character's lives. Yeah, the Fianna and Shadow Lord might have a brawl weekly over how much latitude to grant the lumber company, but it's also about what happens when they take their kids to the park, or a Garou finds out his daughter is on drugs, or another rages and guts his boss in a closed door meeting.<br/><br/>I'm not saying these are the only stories (or even that these are the right ones), although you will want to find a handful of broad brush campaign models. It's easier with estalbished settings because you don't have to worry about the questions that you might want to ask in the Burning, or might come up in play like "What's the best trade good from the biggest city?" <br/><br/>Instead, you can cut to the chase and focus on the meaty story aspects. What situation are the PCs tangled up in, and who are they tangled up in it with?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_110831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/110831/#Comment_110831" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-30T16:15:49+00:00" title="November 30, 2007  4:15PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you Alvin, that helped me <b>a ton</b>.<br/><br/>A quick follow up then:<br/>Let's say you were about to run some WWtA, and you'd come up with those five broad campaign types.

Then, I would address any subquestions in them before moving to the next.<br/><br/>But it also should be organic.  Say you've established that a Pentex mining company's activities threatens the Caern in a Guardians campaign, and you've established that there's a Red Talon pack who wants to wipe out anyone working for the company, the Silver Fang leadership has been trying to use his human contacts to shut the company down, and the Black Furies and Children of Gaia are allied against them because the spirit world is dying from wyrm infection. And now you're asking about families and connections or something, and the Lupus player says, "You know what I want, I want the Red Talon pack to be enlisting <i>all</i> the lupus wolves on the sly to attack <i>all</i> humans. I'm involved as a Lupus, although I want out, but it's like a Mafia code, I can't just leave, and my wolf instincts makes it even harder to leave the powerful Alpha's influence."  Okay, you go back and modify that second question, no problem.<br/><br/>Also, and this just might be my style, I wouldn't hand the questions out. I'd read the questions. I would want the atmosphere to be a discussion, and I think handing out questions might get people looking down at the paper too much. Because the words are guideposts.  If you are doing the End of Days and have the "Pack is chosen" thing I mentioned, and someone goes "I want us to be the underdogs. Another pack are the chosen ones, but they're arrogant assholes and full of themselves and we <i>hate</i> them and want to prove ourselves better" and everyone else says "Yeah!" (important) then hell yeah, toss it and go with the new direction. Having it in paper might make people less open to going off the defined path.  But again, that's my thoughts. You might want to hand them out if its online or a week in advance for people to brainstorm before coming together.<br/><br/>If you're asking for what order to develop them, I would have all my subquestions written before starting the Campaign Burning, but I like to have my bases covered like that. Whatever order works for you is good. The big questions might be enough to riff off of for you, and that's fine too.<br/><br/>I also can't recommend Falling Blossoms enough for a fleshed out method of this.  It's basically where I've pulled inspiration from. Even if you have no interest in running BW, it's worth it for this.<br/><br/>X-posted with Noble: Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
