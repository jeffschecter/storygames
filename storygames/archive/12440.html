It's a con for role-playing and anime enthusiasts; mostly the latter, it seems.<br/><br/>This is the first time I've been a true and proper Guest of Honor, and I just loved it, every minute of it.<br/><br/>What did I enjoy the most? The feeling of being taken so well care of - both because that's a wonderful feeling in itself, and because it meant I could focus totally on the work I was doing. Because there was a lot to do.<br/><br/>In the two days I was there, I...:<br/>- Was interviewed by a newspaper. The journalist was curious and positive, but did ask me about a billion times if people ever had trouble getting out of character (known as the "does gaming make you crazy" question).<br/>- Had a Q&amp;A session in the caf\xe9. Not many people showed up, but an older woman who was sitting there knitting did applaud politely afterwards.<br/>- Was in a panel on the everyday life of an RPG designer. Is it all about sex, money and drugs? The other guys had never done any drugs.<br/>- Participated in a panel on railroading vs sandboxes (mostly in a video game context, but I just babbled away about tabletop RPGs anyway).<br/>- Held a lecture on indie RPGs in the US and Scandinavia. I tried to make sure people understood that games by me &amp; my friends were the best in the world.<br/>- Held a GoH speech about me, myself and my games. I think 10 people showed up, and I love them all for it.<br/>- Ran "Love in the time of Seid" with a great group of dramatic and imaginative people, who approached disturbing and horrific scenes with gusto.<br/><br/>In addition, there was a lot of eating and drinking and hanging out with cool people - everything was tightly structured, which was mostly a blessing, but meant I wasn't able to join a spontaneous game I was invited to.<br/><br/>The high point was most definitely the Dead Dog Party after the con was over. Drinking licorice Koskenkorva in a cabin by the lake, hanging out in the sauna, skinnydipping in the hot Finnish night, playing games and talking about games, getting to know people - it was just amazing.<br/><br/>I'm really glad I met so many nice and amazing people. Still trying to get in touch with a few, so if you read this and you met me at Tracon, drop me an e-mail at matthijs1000 (at) hotmail (dot) com!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_279520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jaakko%20Koivula" title="Jaakko Koivula"><img alt="Jaakko Koivula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.saunalahti.fi/keizzah/avatar.bmp"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jaakko%20Koivula">Jaakko Koivula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/279520/#Comment_279520" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-07T00:24:39+00:00" title="July  7, 2010 12:24AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Matthijs!<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat to hear that you enjoyed the con so much!<br/>\n<br/>\nHad to come here and register myself, as you spoke so highly of this place at the Dead Dog.

Well, I hope so. I talked about The Forge and SG, Fastaval, Jeepform and freeform, Norwegian Style, and how nobody knows what the Finns are doing because they have such a silly foreign language.<br/><br/> (But I did buy Zombie Cinema, which looks fun, and one of James Raggi's oldskool scenarios. And I got a copy of Star Wreck as well.)<br/><br/>They taped everything, and are going to send me a DVD, which should be interesting to watch... no idea what to expect, I'm not too used too seeing myself on screen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
