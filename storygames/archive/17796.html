It can be tough to get feedback just from throwing it up here without much context (and tough to get feedback in general; the s-g crowd is a choosy lot who have a LOT of good games to choose from, and name recognition means something).<br/><br/>One of the things that may help get eyeballs around here is telling us <b>what your game does</b>, as opposed to <b>what the setting is</b>. By that I mean: what do the players do at the table? Are we killing Daemons? Are we taking over the world? Or what?<br/><br/>Also: 15, cool. I wish I had known I could design games when I was 15.

First off, welcome to Story Games. I haven't played your game, but I thought I'd give it a real read-through and point out what sticks out as odd to me. <br/><br/><br/>On to the game, your concept interested me enough to keep reading. I'd say there's a few simple issues, a lot of it regarding the slightly (possibly significantly) cliche names. At the same time, the names are simple and for the most part tell me what things are. Ones I have issues with: "The Sanctity", "Terrania" (that one in particular just sounds rather generic), "Havens" (I know what you're going for, but this just bugs me. My first instinct is to call 'em enclaves, but I don't really know why). In that intro you also have a bit of a capitalization thing going on with things that probably don't need it - Government, Theology (in fact, the way you use it, it would just be lowercase - I would even just say religion), Wastelands, Humanity, Society. The ones I'd keep capitalized are The Abyss, The Rift, The Sanctity, The Purgers, The Hosts, Terrania, The Daemons. All of these are either categories/organizations or proper nouns. Havens (or whatever) are probably okay to capitalize too. <br/><br/>However, even in the intro, it was not clear what <i>I</i> was going to be doing in this world. Looking ahead, I can see that we'll be playing Hosts - that's something I want to know right during the intro to the game, what I'm going to be doing in the world is just as important as the world itself. <br/><br/>Some more guidance on the Abyss's imagery is good. This is the place where you get to show off just how terrifying it really is - use the best imagery skills you can muster there.<br/><br/>More arbitrary capitalization. I would say to remember that capitalization isn't really a tool for calling out important terms. If you really want to call attention, underline, or bold, or italic, or put it in a special font, or some similar change without altering the word itself.<br/>In particular right now I'm talking about Ruler and Theocracy again.<br/>Noble is a weird word to use to describe them. Maybe go a bit further than that, I don't really understand what you mean by it.  Also, you used the phrase "the Theocracy" again, but in reference to a different Theocracy than you do in the intro about the Sanctity and the Prophet.<br/><br/>There are no humans who are not Hosts but do not agree with the Sanctity? That's what's implied at least, so make sure that's what you want. Also: "inside of Sanctuaries, building covered in Suppressants." I'd simplify that language - I mean, you never use these words again in the text anyway. Maybe just "in grand structures fortified to repel Hosts and Purgers."<br/>You're calling the members of the Sanctity "The Sacred"? Wouldn't "The Sanctified" be a little easier to keep track of?<br/><br/>Incumancy is definitely a weird name. It sets it apart and is kinda cool in itself, but it could be easier to just say "Magic" or "Heresy" or some other term commonly known.<br/><br/>Okay, I'm looking at Character Creation right now. This is the first I'm actually hearing of having a Daemon type - I guess this means we're all Hosts.<br/>As referenced to do, I jumped to the Skill List. I only get one thing I'm good at to start? Maybe give us two. I'll get to the actual list itself in a few minutes... Also, you're going to want a guideline or advice of some kind to writing your own Skills (or Phobias) - what makes a good one, what's too specific, what's far-too-broad, etc.<br/>Starter abilities are okay, but I'd reword that "no level" thing - it confused me. Maybe that's just me though.<br/>Oh boy, Stats. Things here are very obviously D&amp;D-influenced. DEX and WIS, without all of the others, appear to be weird phrasings. Consider just making it MOB/MOV (Mobility or Movement, respectively) and MEN (Mental) or something of the sort. PSI is pretty cool though. A simple 3, 2, 1, 0 scale is nice, though the wording of the "it would be wise" thing is pretty bad and doesn't read as much of anything.<br/>Do you intend for all the characters to have pretty similar HP (other than ones with HP-increasing Daemons - EDIT: All the daemons are HP-increasing, maybe mention that)? If you'd rather a little more variety, a multiply scale could be cool (multiply by 6 then add 5 or something - that gives HPs of 23, 17, 11, 5). I'm just spitballing though, it really depends on what you're going for.<br/>Phobia! Okay, and this tells me that you're using a dice-pool mechanic. I <i>definitely</i> like success while afraid = XP.<br/><br/>So, looks like a modified Lady Blackbird, or maybe from the source of it, The Pool. That's cool, those are good games to base things on. At the beginning though, with only one Skill, you're going to be relying on that dice-pool way more. Presumably, that's why you're giving us 10 dice to start with, rather than the 7 of LB.<br/>Rewrite the text for what to do with your dice on a fail. It doesn't at all communicate that the dice from your dice-pool <i>return</i>, along with the additional die for failing.<br/>It's very nice to see you can still succeed on a fail if it complicates the situation. That's a good thing to call out.<br/>WOAH you can buy dice back with g. At any point? Damn. I don't know what that does to game structure.<br/><br/>..."or supernatural abilities beyond the capability of a normal creature." Isn't that ALL of them? They're supernatural, they're beyond the ability of natural creatures. For that matter, what Natural Feats can you perform with PSI? I can't think of any at all.<br/>"...they're stupid." CHANGE IT. Don't insult your players, or have your GMs insulting theirs. Maybe they're just mistaken.<br/>Actually, I like the mechanism for the Supernatural Feats. Pretty sweet.<br/><br/>Hmm. The level-by-using looks pretty nice, and that added comment from the Phobias (which should be added here at Leveling Up as a reminder) gives a story aspect to XP too. The numbers don't seem too bad either, but by high levels they might take a REALLY long time to level up.<br/><br/>Not even paying attention to the Level Gaining chart right now, I'll just assume it works.<br/><br/>Okay, on Special Case you say a lot of things I don't understand. I thought Daemons and Hosts were already merged and that's what made you a Host. I don't know what it means to be <b>Exorcised</b>, I don't know why this would be a roll anyway, I don't know where this "whole turn" thing is coming from - up til now, there's been no turn structure.<br/>I don't think it's necessary to call out Reveal at all. You've already mentioned that Natural Feats trigger "Whenever a player does an action that the GM considers necessary to roll for". Just mention under Hosts in the first chapter that normally their demons can only be seen by them but, at their wish, they can reveal them to whomever they choose.<br/><br/>Piles of abilities! Not readin through 'em all. Seem pretty cool though. I'd probably play a Psiodaemon, even for the Mind Read alone.<br/><br/>Huh. So the GM IS rollign for his monsters, not doing it narrative-style like Lady Blackbird would be doing it. What kind of dice-pools do monster get? It better not be 10 or the players are dead meat.<br/><br/>cont. next post                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402758/#Comment_402758" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-05T15:08:56+00:00" title="January  5, 2013  3:08PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 6, 2013 6:18PM by horn_head_o.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            cont. from previous post<br/><br/>The Skill list looks pretty arbitrary. Come on, do you actually expect ANYONE to pick Acupuncture?<br/>And the Phobias list is almost definitely a cut-and-paste job. Go through and pick out the most interesting, say, 2 dozen. People can write their own, no need to provide a billion ones no one will ever pick ("fear of vomiting secondary to airsickness" "fear of muscular incoordination" "fear of peanut butter sticking to the roof of the mouth" "fear of Bolsheviks" "fear of long waits" - p.s. I'm not making fun of anyone who has these phobias but pointing out that they're awfully silly things to take in a game about being a daemon-bound fighter against a monster invasion).<br/><br/>The gear list suddenly is implying we have sci-fi technology. Do you intend for this to be futuristic in its tech? If so, call that out earlier somewhere in the first chapter.<br/>After the rest of the text being pretty clinical in its descriptions, it's a touch jarring for you to be calling out stuff as really awesome on the last page of text.<br/>Uh, 30g to revive someone from the dead? That's really cheap. That's almost trivial actually, as is 20g for a complete regeneration even when dead bracelet. <br/><br/>On the whole, it's an interesting draft built around an intriguing enough concept. Pretty much the entire thing could use some rewriting (a lot of the writing itself is just a bit stilted, awkward, or confusing - I could get the point, but it took a couple read-throughs sometimes), and there are definitely little weirdnesses all over the place, but it's got my interest enough to give it a second look sometime. Keep it up, and again, welcome to Story Games!<br/><br/>EDIT: And DEFINITELY what Hans said about your age - it is awesome that you're already designing and sharing games by 15 and that in no way means your stuff is inherently inferior.

So you are miles ahead of me in that you have managed to make a pretty functional game (And a pretty fun setting).<br/>The criticisms and question I have mechanically have all really been said by horn_head_o above me, so I will be focusing more on really getting to grips with your setting, because it looks great, and seeing what direction you want to take it. Feel free to say 'yes', 'no', 'doesn't really matter' to any and all of them too, they are just food for thinking. If you want to keep these things up to each individual playgroup, that is cool too! The main thing to remember is as the designer you always want to feel like you have ownership of your own thing. Its your baby. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/><br/>The first daemon that leaps out at me is the Forta. I love games that give me ways to help out, defend and take damage for my allies, it is my favourite character archetype ever. So this is cool, because if different people are interested in your different 'classes', then you know you have managed to create a game in which one isn't a clearly superior option.<br/><br/>Setting:<br/>The Abyss tells you to think up scary stuff to torment your players with... Does the Abyss shape itself around the character's fears, or is it always the same? What are those brief moments of sleep like for Hosts, and how does that affect them? If hosts go crazy after that long exposure, do groups of hosts have screening procedures? Do they know when somebody is on the brink of 'He's going to go to sleep and wake up crazy, or he is going to stay awake and go crazy...'<br/>How do Hosts feels about their new 'gifts'? Are their general schools of thought on it, and maybe groups of Hosts that try and get themselves exorcised permanently? Likewise, are there maybe members of the Sanctity who are a bit more radical in their schools of thought, and keep Hosts continuously exorcised until such a point as they see a horde of Purgers coming down and decide to let their weapon off the leash?<br/>The weapon and equipment list hints at a future, but what does this future look like? Has the world been ravaged by desperate attempts to control the daemons and purgers or does much of the infrastructure remain intact, with desolate and empty skyscrapers and abandoned roads dominating the landscape? How does the Prophet keep contact between the remaining settlements, or have the Sanctity all retreated to one area? If so, what does that place look like? Is it an overpopulated, walled metropolis, or a functional commune?<br/>What is it like to find out you are a Host? How do you find out? How do others find out? Do you have to show them? How does the Prophet know? Does he have a secret police? Would people rat you out?<br/>What is the relationship like between a Host and their daemon? Are they friends, master-servants, or really just the same person? Does it vary? If they are the same person, is there an instant and noticable change in your personality from the minute you take on a daemon?<br/>How do the Hosts feel about the Purgers? Are they fighting a war on two fronts? Or are they just trapped in the middle? Are there maybe some Hosts who hate that they are hunted by The Sanctity, and those they used to feel were friends, and are turning the war primarily onto the Purgers? Likewise, are there some that only kill Sanctity members because they are so bitter about being cast out?<br/><br/>Hope that gets your brain cranking around~<br/>Honestly, this is really cool, and I look forward to see what the revision has in store!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Foroth" title="Foroth"><img alt="Foroth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Foroth">Foroth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402831/#Comment_402831" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-06T14:22:48+00:00" title="January  6, 2013  2:22PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your comments!
