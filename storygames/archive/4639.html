It has game mechanics for erotic encounters, mood changes and some other nice surprises along the way. I've just skimmed through the book, but it does look quite impressive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only catch is that it is in Spanish. So if you happen to read in that language, you can download the game on its website:<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://www.libidogame.com/<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game book does contain sexually explicit images and it's recommended for adults only.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, really impressive.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: (I somehow forgot to mention that it's free: CC-BY-SA-NC)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104849/#Comment_104849" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T11:59:23+00:00" title="October 25, 2007 11:59AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really want to read this game!<br/><br/>Damn it.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104855/#Comment_104855" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T12:20:27+00:00" title="October 25, 2007 12:20PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ren\xc3\xa9, could you tell us more about the game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elmago79" title="elmago79"><img alt="elmago79" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f41/doguiii/rdh12.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elmago79">elmago79</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104870/#Comment_104870" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-25T12:59:31+00:00" title="October 25, 2007 12:59PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 25, 2007 1:01PM by elmago79.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've just finished reading it. Here's a quick overview. <br/>\n<br/>\nLibido is an SG that revolves about emotion. Character have three main "attributes": body, mind and spirit, rated from 1-10. Game mechanics are simple, you roll a d10 and try to roll below your score. There are two sub-attributes for perception. You have accents, which are sort of freeform skills that modify certain roll, for good or worse. You also choose what is the best and worst part of you personality, which may also affect the rolls. There's also a Health rating.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter are created by filling a questionnaire and rolling values.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real gems are the "Invisible mechanics", as the authors calls them. The first, Mood, seems to drive the game. Mood is rated one through ten, with high numbers being increasingly good and low numbers increasingly bad. The character starts in a neutral mood, but events in the story change your mood for good or worst. Each character decides how and how much each action affects them. Seeing your best friend murdered might have a lot of impact, and provoke fear. Flirting with your girlfriend might be a mild impact, and provoke love or desire or even hapiness. Yo chose how much, and a roll determines how your Mood changes. Both High and low Moods have mechanical impacts. A Mood of 1 focused in Fear means you might suffer a heart attack and die from fear, while a 10 with love as an emotion means you're in total bliss. Also, high Moods let you make some rerolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, there's the erotic mini-game. Since this is a game about emotion, erotic encounters can influence your Mood a lot, depending on the nature and satisfactory level of the encounter. To start this minigame, both character need to be aroused (Mood mechanics) and then you start this game in which you chose from several possible advances from a various boards and describe them... there are various phases to this, each more physical than the last. Your choice of action gets rewarded with Pleasure points, positive or negative, according to the Erotic Ascendant of your lover, which only the Guide knows. If you make the wrong advance, you might ruin the mood. The culmination of the encounter may swing your mood more permanently, for good or worse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some more interesting mechanics, specially in how to design scenarios (called Interactive Stories) of which two samples are included: The first one is a really weird detective story, supercharged with emotion. The second one is designed to be played one on one between couples, and it's openly erotic in nature, which showcases two of the possible playstyles.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems the intention of the author is to make some more of this pre-written scenarios available for sale in the future for sale, while the main rules remain free. If the quality compares to these two, they will be certainly worth their money.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, even if you don't speak Spanish you might one to download the game to take a look at the layout design and the outwork. (Please remember this is a mature game with explicit erotic content).

I knew what the game was about going in, so the artwork didn't surprise me. Is it gratuitous? Maybe, but let's face it, the game's called Libido and you have sexual positions/fetishes tokens!<br/><br/>I'll keep reading.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
