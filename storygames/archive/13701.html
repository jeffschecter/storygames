The game can end up being several solo games that are going on simultaneously, with a lot of audience time.  <br/><br/>Or, in other games, you might see goals or beliefs that are sort of taoist or buddha-like in their not-striving.  "I want to find peace" or "I just want a warm bed."  Leaving the GM or other players to do all the work to get these people into conflict.  (Great goals to have in real life, not so great for stories.)<br/><br/>I think goals and best-interests are possibly the single most important thing driving stories and story games ... it's a shame that it's so easy to cock them up.<br/><br/>So I've been thinking about getting much more structured about it.  Cards or lists with fairly narrowly defined goals.  <br/><br/>One could use them with a lot of games ... In a Wicked Age (for the best interests), Misery Bubblegum (for the dreams), Archipelago (for the destinies), Geiger Counter (for the goals) ...<br/><br/>Here's some examples of what some cards say - the last, italicized line is your best interest or destiny or whatever.<br/><br/>---<br/>One of the other players has something you really want.<br/>---<br/>Answer now:  Which player?<br/>Answer in play:<br/>What do they have?<br/>Why do you want it?<br/>How do you get it?<br/><i>How do you secure it, so you know you'll never lose it?</i><br/>---<br/><br/>---<br/>One of the other players wrongs you.  <br/>---<br/>Answer now:  Which player?<br/>Answer in play:<br/>How do they wrong you?<br/>Why?<br/><i>How do you get back at them?</i><br/>---<br/><br/>---<br/>You want one of the other players.<br/>---<br/>Answer now:  Which player?<br/>Answer in play:<br/>Why do you want them?<br/>Why can't you have them?<br/><i>How do you win them?</i><br/>---<br/><br/>Oh, and I almost forgot to say, to play you deal a bunch out face up in the middle of everyone and then choose - you don't get assigned a single one.<br/><br/>So, I'm looking for feedback.  Why is this a good or bad idea;  what does it need;  where does it go overboard;  too constraining / not constraining enough;  does it need to be tied more closely with setting, more specific ...<br/><br/>What's better, letting you decide which player your interest lies with or saying something more detailed like, "The player on your right wrongs you.  How do you get back at them?"<br/><br/>And ... what games already do something like this, besides the Mountain Witch?  [One difference between this and Mountain Witch is this would be in the open.]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_310070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/310070/#Comment_310070" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-28T10:47:11+00:00" title="January 28, 2011 10:47AM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2011 10:49AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is good stuff.

The problems in the town naturally conflict these relationships and put pressure on players to act. There is no need to pre-play or pre-decide what your PC might do. It's all obvious in play and when it's not obvious, it's even more fun because the tension in deciding when no decision is right or wrong is glorious. <br/><br/>I coupled this with brief solo scenes between PCs with their positive relationships that are negative relationships with other PC. The goal being to build empathy so when 1 PC goes gunning for that NPC, the other PC is invested in reacting. <br/><br/>It worked perfectly.

"I want to find peace" or "I just want a warm bed."  Leaving the GM or other players to do all the work to get these people into conflict.</blockquote>\nI mean, this is the GM's job, right? To hammer the Characters (not the Players, the Characters) with things that disrupt their goals or offer up opportunities that can get them to their goals -- but there will be complications down the road.<br/><br/>In another post somewhere, I think (but I'm not sure), you said something along the lines that GMs in these crazy story games have been neutered. <br/><br/>I've never seen or experienced that at all. I know people play some games that way (but I don't play with those people -- either as Player or Game Master) and some games have come out that I suspect neuter the GM (though I've shied away from them) but <i>Sorcerer</i>, <i>In A Wicked Age</i>, D<i>ogs in the Vineayard</i>, <i>Apocalypse World</i>, <i>Polaris</i> (as the responsibilities of GM rotate), <i>Hero Wars</i> and <i>HeroQuest</i>, <i>The Mountain Witch</i> and more all depend on having a very active GMs. <br/><br/>Now, this is all kind of complicated because goals, beliefs, best interests and so on are all different things used in different ways in different games, and I'm loath to speak about these things without the actual context of actual games...<br/><br/>But, in general, if I'm the GM and I have a Player with a Character who "wants peace" then my job as GM is to <i>threaten the PCs peace</i> and, in the context of whatever the game system's procedures are, make sure there's some solution for getting peace. (Stop this king from causing war across the land, find this arcane ritual that can bring a man peace, rescue my son, bring the goddess back to the moon, and so on...)<br/><br/>After all, if you take apart the movie <i>Aliens</i>, you'll discover that what Ripley really wants is a good night's sleep.

Ripley has an extremely active, external desire. We just don't see it until 20 minutes into the movie.<br/><br/>There's always a danger comparing media that's an orchestrated creation (books, movies) with games, which are a wonderfully messy, improv creation. But if you consider Ripley someone's character in a game, her player would have said "my overwhelming desire is to protect my daughter, but she's gone, so I'm not sure that's a good motivation" and the other players said "oh no problem, we can totally work that in.

For some reason my brain can do it. Scene by scene we march forward in a film, just as scene by scene we march forward in an RPG session. Scene by scene in a movie we don't know what will happen next as we watch it, and scene by scene in RPG play we don't know what will happen next as the story is created.<br/><br/>No big deal for brain to map them. I'm weird, I guess.<br/><br/>Anyway, so <i>Aliens</i>...<br/><br/>The scene your talking about, the one that got cut, is when Burke tells Ripley that while she was traveling through space for decades in deep sleep, her daughter aged, got cancer and died.<br/><br/>And here's another thing about me: For me, there's what in the story, and there's what isn't in the story, and the two never meet. The fact that there's something, anything, on the cutting room floor is moot. There's no mention of Ripley's daughter in the whole movie. So it doesn't matter. What matters is what I see and hear in the movie.<br/><br/>(This is why my brain is simply boggled  by any interest in "Canon" or filling in backstory from a novel in what happened in a comic book or whatever. I simply don't get it.)<br/><br/>All I know about <i>Aliens</i> is what I see and hear on the screen while the movie plays. That's it. Done. Anything that might or might not have been in one cut or another doesn't matter.<br/><br/>In the movie <i>Aliens</i> what do I see? I see a woman tormented by nightmares. I am told she's lost her license and can't get her shit together and is working in a cargo dock. Burke shows up. He needs her help: the colony has gone silent. She tells him to fuck off. He taunts her with her current work situation, and then this:<br/><br/> <span style="font-family: Courier;">BURKE<br/>                    If you go.<br/>                           (pause)<br/>                    It's a second chance, kiddo.  And<br/>                    it'll be the best thing in the<br/>                    world for you to face this fear<br/>                    and beat it.  You gotta get back<br/>                    on the horse...<br/><br/>                                   RIPLEY<br/>                           (frosty)<br/>                    Spare me, Burke.  I've had my<br/>                    psych evaluation this month.<br/><br/>        Burke leans close, a let's-cut-the-crap intimacy.<br/><br/>                                   BURKE<br/>                    Yes, and I've read it.  You<br/>                    wake up every night, sheets<br/>                    soaking, the same nightmare<br/>                    over and over...<br/><br/>                                   RIPLEY<br/>                           (shouting)<br/>                    No!  The answer is no.  Now<br/>                    please go.  I'm sorry.  Just<br/>                    go, would you.<br/><br/>        Burke nods to Gorman who rises with him.  He slips a<br/>        TRANSLUCENT CARD onto the table, heads for the door.<br/><br/>                                   BURKE<br/>                    Think about it.<br/></span><br/>End of scene.<br/><br/>She sleeps. She has another nightmare, waking up in a horrible sweat. She calls Burke. Says yes. Boom. She's on her way.<br/><br/>She doesn't know anyone on the colony. She's not connected to the colony. She has no reason to go but one, the one Burke offers: A second chance to face her fears, get over he nightmares and get a good night's sleep.<br/><br/><br/>****<br/><br/>So, some things:<br/><br/>I noticed a while back that the "Goal" of a movie usually aren't introduced at first.<br/><br/>A character usually has what I eventually termed a "Desire" floating around in his or her heart.... but it's not attached to a goal in any way.<br/><br/>John McClain wants to re-connect with his wife in <i>Die Hard</i>. <br/>Sheriff Brody wants to keep the peace on Amity Island in <i>Jaws</i>.<br/>Indian Jones covets old things <i>Raiders of the Lost Ar</i>k.<br/>Luke is an impatient farm boy who wants to get off the farm and have adventure in <i>Star Wars</i>.<br/><br/>And then something new enters the picture, what I call an Opportunity or Threat, that can either make the heart's desire possible or will just crush it.<br/><br/>Terrorists take over the building in Die Hard<br/>A mutilated body washes up on the beach in Amity.<br/>The government tells Jones that someone is close to finding the Ark.<br/>Luke gets a message from a princes needing help.<br/><br/>At that moment the potential of what was a Desire is made concrete. (Just like Ripley's Desire wanting to get through the night without waking up, gasping, drenched in sweat has the potential to become concrete with the "second chance" Burke offers.)<br/><br/>We don't even have a Goal yet. Not really. Everything is still tenuous, and the actual consequences and stakes involved in the story aren't quite revealed yet.<br/><br/>John McClane doesn't have a plan or a goal when he hears gunshots and then sees men with guns. Luke doesn't go chase the princess by himself. And so on. But an opportunity is there.<br/><br/>And then what we have is a <i>series</i> of Goals. McClane works to get a gun. Brody works to puzzle out what happened to the dead girl. Jones goes looking for his old mentor in Nepal. Luke chases after R2 when the droid runs away to Ben's old hut. And so on.<br/><br/>And each Goal leads to the next goal. Goals shifting from one to the next as the circumstances drop out from under the protagonist or new information arrives or new threats arrive and so.<br/><br/>And, in my experience, this is exactly how my best RPG play works. Exactly.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>I bring all this up because it can be incredibly valuable to look at GM prep and PC creation with this perspective for some game. Certainly the games I play and the way I play them.<br/><br/>For example, there are no Goals <i>In A Wicked Age..</i>. Or, rather, there are no Goals at first. There are Best Interests at first, but those aren't Goals. A Best Interest might lead a Character to form a Goal... and the Character might even attain that Goal... but he might not. He might think he has to kill someone in his Best Interest, and then discover he'd better off allying with this once-an-enemy against a pirate king. And now there is a new Goal.<br/><br/>I brought up Ripley in <i>Aliens</i> in this thread, and now all this other stuff, because in the games Jamie seems to be talking about, and certainly the games I'm play (IAWA, Sorcerer, Dogs, Hero Wars, The Mountain Witch, and others...) there is a <i>beginning</i> of some kind that stirs the Player Character's heart -- Best Interests, Kickers, Traits, Dark Destinies and so on), but the goals are found in play. These qualities formed during character creation squeeze and propel play forward, but they don't tell us how things will end. More than that, <i>they don't tell us what they ending will be about</i>.<br/><br/>Now, again, I kneel before the need to point out comparing media is problematic, but I point out that from the protagonists points of view that I have mentioned, not one of these protagonists has any clue as to where the hell their headed or what's going to happen or even what their final goals in the story are going to be. <br/><br/>McClain has no idea he'll be confronting an armed man holding his wife hostage. Luke has no idea he'll be leading an attack on a battle station in space. Brody has no idea he'll be fighting a shark mano-a-mano in the open see. These are all new conflicts with new goals that only came about by pursuing previous conflicts with other goals, one after another, that started with a simple desire.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that a lot of RPGs work exactly the same way in term of non-Goal character creation attached to some sort of open-end, non-concrete aspect to the Character's emotional life. Then, as the Game Master and other Players begin offering up actions and words at the table, the Player sees threats and opportunities to grab onto to make these things that were not concrete now concrete... and then these lead to others and so on.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's how I see it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321608">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321608/#Comment_321608" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-23T19:25:37+00:00" title="April 23, 2011  7:25PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2011 7:28PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>I say all the following with full awareness of the risks of comparing media (and I consider a story created through RPG play just one more media).

The fact that there's something, anything, on the cutting room floor is moot. There's no mention of Ripley's daughter in the whole movie. So it doesn't matter. What matters is what I see and hear in the movie.</blockquote>\nAgain, totally unlike a game. In a game there's a whole other layer where the players are talking about what is happening in the game or what they want to have happen.<br/><br/>(Coincidenally I'm in the middle of writing a whole thing about canon. My point wasn't about canon at all. It's about the idea that, like a player, the author has a plan even if the audience hasn't seen it yet. The cut out bit just showed us that the author considered showing it even earlier.)<br/><br/>EDIT you could say the resulting fiction generated by a game looks like the fiction generated by other media, and I'd be with you there, but the process is different in fundamental ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321610/#Comment_321610" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-23T19:36:32+00:00" title="April 23, 2011  7:36PM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2011 7:42PM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You and I disagree on all counts, but this in particular. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Robbins</cite>Again, totally unlike a game.

The writer floats a bazillion ideas around, and so do players at the table. And finally the writer settles on <i>these</i> words, and sends off that manuscript. And the players all agree that <i>these</i> things are the story. <br/><br/>I'll take you on your word that for you there is no similarity.

That's not a bad thing. I love RPG's diversity! The medium is very flexible and young. It's constantly changing. I remember when Emily and Vincent years ago were talking about incorporating improv techniques into RPGs and people were arguing\u2026 RPGs aren't improv! Now D&amp;D 4E references many of those techniques in the DMG. RPGs are constantly evolving and constantly diversifying. <br/><br/>I agree that when looking to inspiration from other mediums, one needs to be careful but I'm reluctant to make absolute statements about what's useful in broad terms.<br/><br/>When people like Christopher or any of the Jeep Form designers talk about their different perspectives, even if their ideas are fairly divergent from one's traditional expectations, I still think it's useful to listen and see what we can learn. Even if we eventually reject those ideas, the process may bear unique fruit!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321643/#Comment_321643" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-24T07:34:04+00:00" title="April 24, 2011  7:34AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2011 7:34AM by Christopher Kubasik.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>&gt;Posted By: jenskot<br/>I would love to hear more on all of this!

And matches my experience gaming. Especially with people new to gaming.<br/><br/>I've found what people write down before play, often quickly changes in play. From relationships, to motivations, to goals. Especially goals. I've seen plenty of people write down a Belief and then in a few scenes completely ignore, abandon, or break it. I've seen people resolve their Best Interests in IAWA in the first scene because in playing they realized they don't find them that interesting. Or the person they decided they hated before play is the person they want to team up with.<br/><br/>We've been playstorming a few "make a movie as you play it" games and the way we've addressed it is by not making decisions till you have enough information to make informed decisions. Which often means delaying decisions traditionally made in character creation till the middle of play. <br/><br/>So for example, you don't choose relationships till after the player characters have been introduced. You don't choose motivations till the source of antagonism has been fleshed out. And you don\u2019t choose major goals till mid-way through, till you have past the point of no return. There are mechanical ways for managing and revealing the various turning points that open these options as the game progresses but I don't want to derail this thread. <br/><br/>When we play Dogs in the Vineyard now, I show the players the list of major NPCs in the town and let them create basic history with them in the form of relationships. But I encourage them to leave most of their Traits and Relationships blank. Rather, we determine and reveal them in play. <br/><br/>I like Jamie's techniques in his first post. I like asking the players provocative questions that reveal history and create situation:<br/><br/>- Which character wronged you?<br/>- How?<br/>- Why didn't you do anything about it? Or did you?<br/><br/>But I've found it can work even better in play after players have had a chance to walk in their character's shoes and we've had time to establish NPCs. This can mean games are less personal at start, as we don't know the characters yet, and may be slow\u2026 which is why I will start things off with an externally motivated conflict to get the ball rolling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321646/#Comment_321646" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-24T08:23:11+00:00" title="April 24, 2011  8:23AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2011 8:25AM by jenskot.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>People were arguing with Emily and Vincent about using improv techniques?

But mostly it occurred at Gen Con and Origins. Nothing dramatic, mainly statements like "don't make RPGs into something they aren't." I also run 150+ person all day gaming events in NYC and I used to hear it there as well. Now it's barely controversial but I remember around 2006 people seemed "threatened" which is weird to me because new games and new ideas aren't going to be the main reasons you change the way you play.* <br/><br/>When D&amp;D 4E came out, specifically the DMG, a few people in the D&amp;D scene decried the influence of indie game thought infecting traditional games with the inclusion of the "say yes" rule and other improv like advice included in the DMG right out of games like Dogs in the Vineyard. <br/>Ultimately, no matter what you do creatively, many people won't like it. Which is totally cool, we don't have to please everyone, just enough people to meet our goals. <br/><br/>The only reason I brought all of this up is now using improv techniques in RPGs seems very natural. But years ago it wasn't. Things change. Which is why I don't want to turn away new techniques that may feel strange at first but rather strive to see what we can learn from them.<br/><br/>*Although to be fair, in the NYC area I knew quite a few gaming groups that broke up once indie games became popular. Players decided they wanted to play something else. GMs wanted to run something different. New games and ideas were abundant. And because the local gaming community was growing strong and you could find new players and GMs easier than before, people shifted around quite a bit. A few people did end up blaming games like Burning Wheel for their groups demise back in the day!

As a teenager I assumed that my high school gaming group was fairly typical of gamers. Then I went to my first gaming convention, and I was both surprised but also really enjoyed how different everyone was and how differently they played. <br/><br/>In many cases certain play styles seemed alien to me. Even beyond play style... my group had 11 people, and we all took turns GMing, and all pooled in to buy game books. But I kept meeting groups where only 1 person GMed and they had to buy all the books. But I also met groups that acted everything out, had an audience of people who didn't play but were just there to watch, wore costumes, and had people chronicle their games. But even people I met at conventions were different than people who I met from online who were very different than people who almost never had contact with outside gamers and you could only reach through local gaming stores. <br/><br/>I love people, socializing, and learning so when my job sent me traveling all over the world I tried to game with as many people from other countries as I could. And how they gamed differently continued to fascinate me. Now don't get me wrong, many people had plenty in common and I was always surprised how people from different cultures make the same gaming jokes. But I quickly learned to not make assumptions about how people played. <br/><br/>It's one of the reasons why I took charge of my local gaming community. I felt the more different people I gamed with, the better of a GM I became. And conversely, the better of a Creative Director I became at work, leading meetings, brainstorming ideas, telling stories, and pitching clients. Because of this, I became directly exposed to easily 500+ gamers from different backgrounds in the last 6+ years. Which has opened up many insights into how people play and how diverse they are.<br/><br/>Getting back to this thread though, this is why I'm very hesitant to ignore techniques from different mediums than may seem to break from tradition. Especially since the whole idea of tradition in RPGs is an illusion when you look at roleplaying from a global perspective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_321658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321658/#Comment_321658" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-24T11:12:28+00:00" title="April 24, 2011 11:12AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thread lives!<br/><br/><br/>I should mention that I *love* In a Wicked Age. Even my worst session of it was better than most of my sessions of D&amp;D. If I hit a 12+ manipulate on Vincent Baker I'd make him write a second chapter of the anthology engine. <br/><br/><br/>The original post was just about trying to get to the next level, and about designing the "User Interface" of a story game so that it's more likely to deliver awesome on your first play, even if the GM doesn't know what they're doing, or there's no GM at all - and I think it's worth giving up some of IAWA's flexibility to hit that.<br/><br/><br/>Blowing my own horn here, with the motivation cards I've made for That's Drama and a perfectly circular r-map you could come pretty close to matching Johnzo's despite the constraints:<br/>Apollo: You Feel Trapped in a Promise. (Player on his right is Conan.)<br/>Khan: They Wronged You And You Want Revenge. (Player on his right is Apollo.)<br/>Bilbo: You Have To Do Something At Their Place. (Player on his right is Khan. So, maybe Khan is the lord of Mt. Doom these days.)<br/>Data: You Covet Their Item. (Player on his right is Bilbo.)<br/>Conan: You Can't Stand Their Motivation (Player on his right is Data - Conan wants the emotion chip for himself - and because he's to the left of Apollo he's the one who is going to be providing the most opposition to Apollo's goal of trying to get out of his sun god responsibilities - by stealing the sun, perhaps?)<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>in general, if I'm the GM and I have a Player with a Character who "wants peace" then my job as GM is to<i>threaten the PCs peace</i></blockquote>\nSo here's why that's less fun than a good player-vs-player best interest, in my experience. As important as it is to be a good audience it's still less fun to be the audience than to be the one doing the talking. If you have a game where everyone has best interests that interact with GM-characters, like "Find peace" or "Face my nightmares" (if they're GM controlled nightmares) or even "Rescue my sister" (if the sister and her captor are both NPCs) then everyone is rolling conflict dice against the GM and vice-versa, and telling the GM "I do this" and seeing how the GM responds "this happens." In a 1 GM + 4 Player game, that means that the GM is talking about 50% of the time and a given player is talking about 13% of the time. If you engineer your R-Map so your players best interests make them roll their conflict dice with each other, you bump each player up to a full participant - they're playing 20%-25% of the time now. They're also more likely to be in a scene and be forced to be a good audience, because they might need to "No you don't" at any moment. <br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher Kubasik</cite>You and I disagree on all counts, but this in particular.<br/></blockquote>\nChristopher, you should totally check out <i>Microscope </i>if you haven't already. I think it really shows what Ben's approach to getting away from cinematic forms can do. It's a bit like <i>The Silmarillion</i>, the game, and while The Silmarillion may make a totally crappy movie turns out it makes a really cool game.<br/><br/>Emulating movies is cool too, though. <br/><br/>I think of games of Fiasco or IaWA as being like starting partway into a movie - the preplay setup is stuff a movie usually handles in the first couple of sequences.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_321660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/321660/#Comment_321660" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-24T11:39:13+00:00" title="April 24, 2011 11:39AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, to be precise, I'm not talking about emulating movies. I'm talking about stealing stuff about setting up stories. Which Ben doesn't want to to (which is awesome!) and I'm sure <i>Microscope</i> is great too.<br/><br/>So, back to IAWA... and Game Masters. I get the feeling you want to relieve the pressure of anyone having to Game Master or do it well. Certainly a common goal these days.<br/><br/>I just want to quickly say that if there's a Game Master, and he wants the challenge, given the set up you have, the GM has the NPC character tag another PC. The NPC says, "I need your help stealing this ring from 'PC X' and I'll get you what you want." There's plenty of ways to make that happen. It really isn't hard. Happens all the time in the games I play. Remember, I'm suggesting, above, that there are "goals" at the start of IAWA play, just Best Interests. And as play begins goals will be found; as play continues goals will be achieved or dropped and new goals will be created. <br/><br/>But as you said, and as the game says, it's best if the Players are already working with Best Interests intertwined.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
