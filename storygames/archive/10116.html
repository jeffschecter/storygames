It got me thinking about how you would do a Porn RPG, and even more so, what would a Porn RPG be? Are we talking about a game simulating sex? Or a game simulating pornography? The pornography industry? Could you use a system like Contenders to follow the lives/careers of porn stars? Could you script sexual encounters ala Burning Wheel? <br/><br/>Anyone got any thoughts or ideas? This is really just an attempt to start a discussion, I have no solid ideas myself or plans to try and create such a game. I think I am asking "If you were creating a porn RPG, what would it be?"<br/><br/>ME                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus" title="Antiquitus"><img alt="Antiquitus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus">Antiquitus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224510/#Comment_224510" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T12:10:46+00:00" title="August 13, 2009 12:10PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 13, 2009 12:45PM by Antiquitus.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd create one that was generally meant to be played with players who enjoy and are comfortable with sexuality together. So, probably two lovers already in a relationship.<br/><br/>In the same way that any story game is meant to be a scaffold for fun and effective collaborative imaginary play, this game, too, would be a scaffold for the creation of a shared imaginary sexual space.<br/><br/>I know that may not seem like "porn", but in my mind, porn is the (impoverished) way a 1-directional medium does sexual imaginary play, just like other (less impoverished) movies are the way a 1-way medium does other kinds of fantasy play. When you make it a story game, you change the nature of the story because now the players own the fantasy. If I designed such a game, I'd feel that there was no reason to preserve the poor quality of sexual fantasy that mainstream pornography sticks to.<br/><br/>Edit: I would probably use Story Jam for this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224511/#Comment_224511" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T12:12:07+00:00" title="August 13, 2009 12:12PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It'd totally have to be like "How to host a dungeon," because unfortunately, for most people porn is definitely "lonely fun."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224514/#Comment_224514" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T12:18:28+00:00" title="August 13, 2009 12:18PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my cynical answer: Most RPGs are porn.  Just not sex porn.  They're pulp porn and fantasy porn and swashbuckling porn and sci-fi porn and star wars porn...<br/><br/>But I'll assume we're talking about sex porn.  I once thought up a game about struggling film makers working on a low-grade movie where the studio/producers wanted a porn film but the characters were in some way trying to jigger it to be seen as an "art" film.  But then that's not quite what you're talking about either.<br/><br/>So then I'll point at Julia Ellingboe's "Tales of the Fisherman's Wife" which I understand to be a stab at RPG erotica by way of fable.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224515/#Comment_224515" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T12:21:58+00:00" title="August 13, 2009 12:21PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Data point: Somebody did Pornstars on the Soundstage, not that long ago.

(Though Contenders re-skinned for porn stars is... interesting.)<br/><br/>I also am thinking something more along the lines of a LARP game, probably a basic system of resource mechanics (clothes?) underlying individual products (booklets) that provide situation, setting, and color cues. Probably cooperative play, though a "competitive," who-gets-to-be-on-bottom thing might work well, too. Something to provide some spice, and maybe even develop a story (or more likely, help a couple or couples tell their own story more fully), that I could take to my purchasing friend at Adam &amp; Eve to get into their catalog (and my other friend at Adam &amp; Eve would end up writing the catalog description for it, probably).<br/><br/>The basic idea being have SOMETHING more structured that pure freeform for mechanics, and use that mechanic consistently across a huge array of "fantasies" for setting, genre, orientation, fetish, etc. ("Fantasy" in quotes to indicate the generalized meaning, not the specific literary or game genre.)<br/><br/>So... the system, then:<br/>* Fan Mail mechanic opportunities are obvious: kisses, bites, *ahem* ... and so forth and so on.<br/>* Clothes as a resource: over clothes (jackets, sweaters, etc) worth less than main clothes (shirts, pants, skirts), which in turn are worth less than underclothes.<br/>* Look at How to Host a Murder Mystery DVD games... a possible "GM" or "Moderator" for the game, via the DVD menu? Different for each game, certainly (esp. orientation, gender; maybe a couple as GMs, for hetero).<br/>* Maybe look back at that Touching Game idea from a ways back: non-verbal communication; touch location has mechanical impact; fingertips versus fingers versus open hand versus gripping; light rough-housing (or not-so-light, for the BDSM games); tickling.<br/>* Multiplayer variations (heh) or separate game products? The Twister 'mechanic,' but with more body parts on the dial, and NOT so much colors on a mat as place on a partner (hmmm... a-whole-separate 'board game' product, there)?<br/>* Each participant plays more than one character, allowing for multiple scene configurations, love-triangle complications (with only one couple), "advanced" techniques like having a character die in the story and playing out the consequences (could be a BIT too "serious" for sexual play, though).<br/><br/>Anyhow... just brainstorming (obviously), but I firmly believe this line of products would outsell any existing RPG as we mean it within a year or so, if well written. In fact, if one believes the stereotype of the "typical RPG geek," the VAST majority of the "Sex RPG" players would, perforce, NOT be gamers. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224529/#Comment_224529" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-13T13:00:51+00:00" title="August 13, 2009  1:00PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They already have these games, don't they?

I find Martial Arts in RPGs to be really boring unless they're over the top wuxia types. So a porn game involving eunuchs could be interesting, or one that has people taking roles they normally wouldn't so that it stays abstracted?

Never saw that crossover coming.) So they created a breaking the ice type game to be played at fetish conventions that revolved around vampires. There were different roles for tops and bottoms to play (vampire/ghoul/victim) different acts to be done depending on your template (the succubus, the vampire lord, the innocent virgin) and different powers depending on that splat as well (the ability to mesmerize and make your victim do whatever you want for ten minutes, being able to attract the undead with your virginal innocence and receive spankings). This was based loosely around the white wolf vampire ideas... but they wrote up a whole detailed game book that they played for years at different conventions. I never played, but I heard it was great fun.<br/><br/>Also a LARP based around fantasy that I did play once allowed for fantastical gods, mortals, and historical figures. They all had different vices, and had to seek them out in play. It played like a complicated game of IAWA, where people had goals and best interest type things and had to interact with everyone else there in order to see them played out. You could also construct your "fetish" which would be the thing you particularly wanted to accomplish that was directly related to sex or foreplay for the evening. Nobody really got past nudity, spanking, or flirtation for the evening... and everyone was in costume and mostly it was more of a romantic atmosphere than a straight on lets go have sex thing.<br/><br/>Obviously in both these situations, you were going into a situation in The Real World where you knew sex/fetish would come up. I guess that's key.<br/><br/>I like Antiquitus's idea of having a Tabletop game where you can interact with fantasies, and maybe once you got to the actual sex part it would fade to black. Kinda like a soft-porn foreplay erotica thing. That would be a really interesting way to engage in what sexual fantasies you want to explore, and a really neat way to do it through a game. But then, I'm a big advocate of people being in touch with their fantasies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224679/#Comment_224679" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T08:46:45+00:00" title="August 14, 2009  8:46AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is super interesting, Kira.  <br/><br/>I've been thinking about how you establish expectations, like where as a group you set the "fade to black" dial.

In no particular order:<br/><br/>* If such things exist, they're not on Adam &amp; Eve's radar. And I'm not thinking of something railroady (script books) or silly fun (pirate hats?!?). Something more along the lines of an actual story game that is replayable and variable and more about exploration than "mere" foreplay.<br/><br/>* Sex already has role playing, yes. Many LARPs run freeform, too... but LARP rules still sell, even as a TON of LARPs write their own heartbreakers. Not dissuaded.<br/><br/>* Interesting map... but I don't think "all RP in sex is fetish," which seems to be the implication. Think Desperate Housewives, done via PTA, with actual physical contact ensuing where the commercial breaks would "fade to black." Speaking of which...<br/><br/>* The fade to black works just fine... in existing RPGs. Sex happens in RPG scenarios, but it is rare (in my experience) for the players to engage in physical interactions as part of the "mechanics" of their characters having sex. OK, you might have folks in LARP give backrubs to "simulate" sex, but kinda the point of this idea is to figure a way to bring the interactions into the shared imagined space. In boffer LARP, you hit each other with safe weapons, rather than roll a d20 to hit. OK, now think that, but sex. (Heh... boffer sex toys might be another accessory line!)<br/><br/>Anyhow, I'm not championing a One True Way. But I do think there's an unexplored marketing space, and I do think knowledgeable design could produce a more viable product than the silly sex board games (truth or dare repackaged) in Spencer's Gifts. I, like the OP, kinda hope to get some actual design notions rolling in this thread (if the sophomoric humor doesn't kill it like it usually does to any thread outside of a handful of... prolific posters'... safe zones).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224682/#Comment_224682" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T08:56:14+00:00" title="August 14, 2009  8:56AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>That is super interesting, Kira.<br/><br/>I've been thinking about how you establish expectations, like where as a group you set the "fade to black" dial.

As far as your questions about articulation: communication, communication, communication. Like any sexual activity, letting your partner(s) know what you expect (i expect this is a scene where you're the bad guy and i'm the good guy), want (i would like you to capture me, tie me up, and then f*ck me silly), and where your boundaries lie (i don't like to be blindfolded, but anything else is fair play) is key in everyone's enjoyment. So, when gaming about sex stuff, you gotta talk about it before hand, and maybe pause mid-play if something is weird for you. Dan Savage always puts it best, to paraphrase, sex gets better the more you practice and talk about it.

A level of separation/veil between the player and what they say/do is like having a few drinks before talking to the pretty girl (or, in Japan, telling off your boss).<br/><br/>Anyway, your fade to black dial would not need to be as tuned with online play.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224685/#Comment_224685" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T09:08:05+00:00" title="August 14, 2009  9:08AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, I'm about to lunch meself. You're spot-on about communication, though--that would probably be the equivalent of the "what is role playing" section that used to be ubiquitous, for any modules released. (I use "module" as a discrete, stand-alone game setting and situation product using the common, underlying system I hope to bang out here and elsewhere... no pun intended. It was getting confusing in an offlist email exchange, talking about "a game" as a single product and then "the game" as the base mechanics; hence "modules" of the "Sex Role Playing Game" system.)<br/><br/>Yeah, ye olde Lines and Veils really, REALLY need to be hashed out, formally, before any sort of "risky" play in the module. Then again, part of my vision for modules is that they basically have built-in Lines, based on the particular situation (or kink, or orientation, or fetish) for the particular product. It should be a bit rare for (say) a Pirate and the Princess module to suddenly take a hard left turn into furry or bestiality play. But even with the "guard rails' of the basic situation and likely expectations, yep, ya gotta talk Lines. Hmmm... maybe Veils don't really come into play, actually.

A game where you could actually delve into your deepest fantasies, or make up situations that imitated the ideas involved in them, fetish, gender, or whatnot. That's dealing with sex without dealing with "Sex". Because whether your a "fetishist" (the biggest open-ended definition ever) or not, everyone's got fantasies.<br/><br/>When getting into mechanics, well, this gets more complicated. I mean, intrinsically, the idea is so simple. "Role-playing" is something we all do during sex, vanilla or not. We play the role of the woman, the man, the top, the bottom, the giver or receiver, the innocent, the kinky... we often adopt roles whether we realize it or not based on the societal norms for sexual behavior... many of which are based off of (which brings me back to the topic of this post) the porn we see. At least, in modern American behaviors. There's been an interesting twist in porn of recent years (not that I , ahem, well anyway) where there's a more realistic documentary feel to it. The popularity of plastic and glamour is becoming a thing of the past, and "real" couples are sharing how they do it with the world. This is kinda tangential, but I think the idea of it is relevant because if you were to create a tabletop RPG that was "simulationist" in a sexual context, I think at the heart of the game there should be something that gets to the real hearts of the players desires, and their communication of them. <br/><br/>Using the game as a tool for this communication is completely awesome, and I would totally play it just for that concept alone. I would be satisfied describing all the interplay, interaction, drama, and mindfucks involved up to the actual sex act, and then end there to either move into one of two things: 1. getting up from the table after getting all worked up and actually perform said act or 2. savor all those ideas to act out the next time things get hot and heavy with your partner(s). Mostly because, well, reading porn, watching porn, or listening to porn (phonesex) are fun, but describing it a game table might be, well, just kinda weird. <br/><br/>I guess if you were going to do <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> suggested above, what you would need is not a system for the sexual acts you were about to perform (eegad, a rules system to tell me how to have sex? that'd have to be damn good to try out) but rather a mindspace to remain in character while you were doin it. So all that tabletop you just did? Well, now you have the context, setting, and possible outcome of the sexual act that's about to happen, and freeforming from there just requires staying in that mindspace. I purposefully use the fetish lingo "mindspace" in this case because that's how they refer to it when they're totally in the mode of their role at the time, ie "subspace" being really submissive. Learning from how the fetish community defines these terms and roles is pretty applicable to this situation whether you include fetish or not, cause they've got years of experience trying to define what these roles mean to them and how they can act them out.<br/><br/>As to the actual game system I would use... it would totally be something like the LARP I described where there was a IAWA type rules. Loose enough to do what you want, and forces interaction which would be key, and can half be run by the players because they would all have specific goals that could be moderated by a gm. This would pretty much be like any other RPG, just with the context changed, and the ability for it to transition smoothly from the table to the bedroom.<br/><br/>I'm just throwin out ideas here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus" title="Antiquitus"><img alt="Antiquitus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus">Antiquitus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224705/#Comment_224705" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T10:49:37+00:00" title="August 14, 2009 10:49AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kira, I like the direction you're going with this.<br/><br/>I think that trying to separate sexual acts from sexual fantasy is practically impossible, so if you do make the choice to bar description of acts from the SiS, you've cut off a lot of territory that you could otherwise explore.<br/><br/>In other words, there are many meaningful scenes that I'd like to explore against the backdrop of characters engaging in explicitly sexual acts.<br/><br/>Also, breaking character monogamy and playing this as a story game with a cast of characters that we all tell stories about might help with navigating the difficult material.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224708/#Comment_224708" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T10:54:21+00:00" title="August 14, 2009 10:54AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I rather like the idea of having a mechanical solution to role-playing sex in game.

I personally am better at typing that kinda thing. Or, y'know, acting it out during sex. It's pretty voyueristic to do that at a table in front of 5-6 people, which seems like it would just fit for that elect group of voyeur/exhibitionists. And well, coming up with a system that moderates kinda leaves out the most interesting part, right? I mean, if you can't describe the sex, just cause you whip out a "Now i do the humping lotus style" power takes the enjoyment out of describing it. Unless that's what you want out of the game.<br/><br/>Having a non-monogamous cast of characters reminds me of those indie movies that are all about sex and relationships with like, 30 main characters all doin it on screen. Interesting thought, but still doesn't get you out of describing a one-on-one act of intimacy. Unless, you had orgies.

Kira, your IAWA idea is pretty good--that's about as complex a system as I'd want (but without the dice, of course--ever rolled over onto a d4?).<br/><br/>Best Interests fire up a situation--they're basically Bangs and Flags (though I might have that backwards; maybe they're Flags and Bangs). So if there's character creation (and I, too, think multiple roles is Teh Hawtness) and the module has some sort of situation inherent in it (remember: these are going to sell like DVDs, not like tool kits), then a concept of best interests would certain drive initial actions and narrations. I also think there could (should?) be a resource system, and clothes makes a good choice. Think about it: it's a natural sort of "escalation" in sex, anyway; but with the ostensible goal of being (mostly) nekkid and goin' at it, the desire to remove clothes could help drive the narration (e.g. I really want to get my shirt off, so I have to narrate two Facts about the current scene because base clothing is worth two). I think it helps if the system requires NOTHING that people don't already (usually) have: clothes, touch, sense, mouths, etc. No dice, no coins, no tokens, no spinners. (That is why I sort of call it a "LARP"--it's live, they are supposedly in character, and the system is unobtrusive, if existent at all.)<br/><br/>But, then again, not every situation leads straight to nudity (often quite the opposite--dress up just to get down). So the touch thing might be the "core" system, with clothing removal or donning representing some orthogonal element of the system, like scene transition or (again) narrative authority. So the touch element, then, would be more along the lines of the conflict (or task?) resolution system, with the clothing bit being more about overall structure and pacing (makes a sort of sense, put that way).<br/><br/>Hell, there's a lot to unpack, here. I reckon "a game that uses sex" isn't a sufficient design goal to close down the decision space. Maybe a step back is in order--after all, some folks in the thread are thinking Sim and Fade To Black, while others are thinking Nar and Get It On (Eventually), and still others are in more of a "widget for doing sex in RP" (if I read Michael right).<br/><br/>Me, I'm pretty squarely in the "Nar Game using touch and foreplay and even sex as both system and a way to inform the narrative." With a LARGE dose of "be able to churn these fuckers out like romance novels, to sell bucket-loads on Adam &amp; Eve's site." I've even already tapped a writer friend who, yep, works for them... and I am going to mention to the purchasing friend next time I see her at the pub (hmmm... or maybe she's involved in product photography, now that I think of it? I'm not sure; she just always seems to have stuff from work to give away). Could it be we actually might have to FORK this thread, if folks want to go in different agenda directions? 'Cause I'm wanting to get down to actual system and rules and techniques, so that i can present it as a fait accompli, when I meet the writer friend... who, hopefully, can provide copious fodder for module content, as he basically writes the blurb-reviews of all their DVDs (so, like, he's see it ALL, and I mean ALL of it. Yes, even THAT stuff *shudder*).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus" title="Antiquitus"><img alt="Antiquitus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus">Antiquitus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224722/#Comment_224722" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T11:42:19+00:00" title="August 14, 2009 11:42AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2009 11:57AM by Antiquitus.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kira,<br/><br/>You're right, of course. Describing sex, even with maturity and with the understanding that the sexual acts themselves are "not the point", can be very vulnerable at a gaming table. As gamers, we are much more desensitized to stories about explicit violence and death than to stories about explicit sex and romance. Personally, I would find it challenging to step up to a sexual story, but would be glad to give it a shot with an open group or partner.<br/><br/>Sorry, I didn't mean a "non-monogamous cast of characters". I was referring to players' 1:1 relationship with their characters. So you'd have 2+ players describing the actions of a few characters, the but all of those characters belong to the group, not to specific players.<br/><br/>I've found that such a set up can help with vulnerability and not taking things personally, while still allowing for really exploring the issues in a personal way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224724/#Comment_224724" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T11:45:06+00:00" title="August 14, 2009 11:45AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Multiple characters doesn't mean multiple participants, Kira! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I think a LOT of the modules would be built with a cast of at least four or five, intended to be played by a couple (or, you know, a small group of very close friends).

He's a once and future gamer, so he's not totally ignorant to system elements. But he's only ever "trad" gamed, so I will probably have to crash course him in things like scene framing, shared authority, resource mechanics, conflict resolution, and so forth.<br/><br/>(Yes, I am basically hawking this thread, today--I really, REALLY think this thing has some legs!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_224732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus" title="Antiquitus"><img alt="Antiquitus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus">Antiquitus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224732/#Comment_224732" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T12:09:56+00:00" title="August 14, 2009 12:09PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool idea that just popped into my head: A mechanic that brings together character monogamy and character MONOGAMY.<br/><br/>Clearly, that would make that module at least preoccupied with swinging or infidelity, but that could be interesting... when you switch a character, suddenly you're talking about a new sexual relationship as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_224733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/224733/#Comment_224733" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-14T12:09:59+00:00" title="August 14, 2009 12:09PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>Me, I'm pretty squarely in the "Nar Game using touch and foreplay and even sex as both system and a way to inform the narrative."

Players learn about each other RL through truth or dare and then apply that to the fiction to intensify it. They reward each other's narration when it arouses them. The game gives a slight disadvantage to male-gendered characters.<br/><br/>The key conceits of the game are:<br/><br/><b>Truth or Dare in the resolution mechanic</b> <br/><br/>While the game has a typical card-based Fortune resolution mechanic, it can be trumped by a player performing a "truth or dare" challenge. The (rotating) GM offers the player a challenge, and if the question is answered or the dare is performed to the group's satisfaction, the player just wins. The rules discuss careful brinksman ship because the goal is to actually get the player to do stuff -- the challenger wants to find the hardest question/dare that the player will actually answer/perform. <br/><br/>Players are never required to accept questions/dares. Ever. But if you care about winning enough, you can accept the challenge and win.<br/><br/>The rules discuss how players should use question challenges to learn more about the players and then work that knowledge into the game to make it more compelling for them.<br/><br/>I imagine that a group could play this without "going there" or getting very intimate. Really, the rules have a built-in safety valve because you never have to accept a challenge. If it's worth it to win, you will do it; if not, you won't. So tame groups could get by with "soft" question challenges: Describe your first kiss. When did you lose your virginity? <br/><br/><b>Fan mail for arousal</b><br/><br/>Whenever a player does or says something that arouse you, you draw a card and give it to them. Furthermore, you must give it to them without comment. That is designed to reward people for being sexy or interesting or whatever ("arousing," really, and I intentionally don't define the term) and at the same time try to keep it from getting too awkward.<br/><br/>The card just says, "I like that, hot," without anyone ever needing to explain why or interrupt play.<br/><br/><b>Trumps based on gender</b><br/><br/>If you play a male-gendered character, you are slightly disadvantaged mechanically: your trump card is a Jack. If you play a female-gendered character, you are at a slight [edit:] <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">dis</span>advantage: Queens are trump. If you play a character of a "atypical" gender/sex, then Kings are trump. Otherwise, if I remember right, the card order goes by face value within the suit (and out-of-suit cards lose).<br/><br/>I wanted to give an advantage to people playing women in the game. Really, though, I am tempted to change the rule to apply to the sex/gender of the\xa0<i>player</i>\xa0because that's where the help is really needed. I think that's what I really intended, anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_225125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus" title="Antiquitus"><img alt="Antiquitus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antiquitus">Antiquitus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225125/#Comment_225125" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-17T11:58:42+00:00" title="August 17, 2009 11:58AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Benhimself</cite><cite>Posted By: Antiquitus</cite>I purposefully use the fetish lingo "mindspace" in this case because that's how they refer to it when they're totally in the mode of their role at the time, ie "subspace" being really submissive.</blockquote>\nSorry for the OT, but after reading this sentence, I'll never watch Star Trek the same way again.

Yea?</blockquote>Well, again, maybe not quite so railroady or scripted. I can see a variety of playful encounters that don't necessarily go straight to sex. But, yeah, I'm thinking more of a "sex game" and not a "game about sex" or "sex as subject for typical systems." It would probably play closer to a "Sex in the City" PTA game than a "Debbie Does Dallas" 'dungeon crawl'. But, you know, where its stays on screen, so to speak.<br/><br/>That said, Adam, you game sounds pretty damned cool. And actually accessible to groups that aren't swingers, whereas what I'm imagining would at least take folks comfortable with nudity and displays of affection (the "climax scenes"--so to speak--could happen "off camera" in private bedrooms or areas, or it could build to a group orgy). But really, most of the situations would be pre-designed for a specific number of players, irrespective of the number of CHARACTERS (e.g "A two-player sensual game about four friends in a web of desire").<br/><br/>Annnnd... I think that's a wrap, unless folks want to continue withe examples and brainstorming. I think this is a bigger subject than one thread, given the different agendas, scales, and approaches. And I, for one, need to put time into an actual system and playtesting (first time it won't be a chore, I imagine) so I can present something as a prototype.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
