                    So here I'd like to follow up on <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1728" rel="nofollow"><b>"Intentions in Task-Based Resolution"</b></a> -- but I want to drop the whole question of task resolution.  It seems to me that there is more alike here than different, and so I'd like to concentrate mainly on examples from story games rather than traditional tabletop RPGs (like various arguments on the D20 social mechanics).  <br/><br/>My position here is that intent is <i>never</i> taken into account in game mechanics, per se.  Games only work based on declared game actions -- though note that I say "game actions" which is different than "character actions".  The game actions can always be done with different intents.  For example, I can take a game action in Polaris by saying "But only if his hand is chopped off".  There are many reasons why I could choose this as an in-game action.  I might be pushing the Heart to abort the action, or simply going for the stunned reaction, or whatever.  Usually, one declares a game action because one wants that action to succeed.  However, there are plenty of other possibilities.  <br/><br/>To go into more detail, I'd like to consider some of the examples from the earlier thread: 
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Let me try one more example:<br/><br/>Player: I want to try to get the key from that dude. I'll use Diplomacy.<br/>GM: Well, OK, you can use Diplomacy to make him ammenable, but only I know whether or not he has the key.<br/><br/>You see what's happening here? This is an overt example of the DM using "intent irrellevant" methodology. He's saying that the resolution system can't determine if the target character has the key. Which is what the player's intent is - to tag the target character as having the key.</blockquote>
Fair enough.  But, in the theme of this thread, I'd like to expand this to other games.  For example, suppose I'm playing Dogs in the Vineyard, using the Boxelder Canyon scenario.  The PCs suspect the Steward and pressure him.  The players want the Steward to be guilty and confess.  The GM can Give in the conflict and simply have the Steward say whatever he knows, but it's up to the GM (by using or modifying the scenario) what the Steward knows and/or has done.  <br/><br/>This is in principle overcome by using a strict narration system like Soap, Inspectres or Primetime Adventures, where the designated player can narrate whatever he wants, within broad subjective limits.  This reduces GM fiat, but opens up a lot of narrator fiat.  By having a direct channel of what is said into what happens in-game, generally the player will say exactly what she wants as long as what she wants is a particular in-game situation.  <br/><br/>But often, game actions are taken for out-of-fiction, in-game reasons -- like influencing the other players.  i.e. A GM might say something hoping to evoke a horrific mood in the players, but he doesn't succeed.   
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>Ergo, it seems like you're putting a lot of trust in the GM to be sort of a "divine clockmaker," i.e., creating the situation (either a "fair" one or a "realistic" one), and then letting that little virtual world start ticking away on it's own, reacting to the players as they take action... despite the fact that he typically has the power to stack the deck as much as he wants.<br/><br/>But... I dunno. Are indie games all that different? I mean, can't I be less than dispassionate when setting off "bangs", scene framing, or whatever? There's nothing, say, in BWr really stopping me from having the PCs turn the corner and bump into some white-shade uber-dragon.</blockquote>
There are indie games which don't have this to a degree.  For example, there is no concept of difficulty in MLWM.  The roll is the same regardless of whether the PC is trying to overcome an army or defeat a puppy.  So unlike in BW or Dogs, the GM can never just "beat" the PCs with an uber-monster or large crowd. However, a MLWM GM can control things long-term by what different types of scenes occur.  It's unclear how often a player can demand an Overture and get it, though.                </div>

I'm not sure what "intent for the character" means.  Do you mean what the player says the character intends?  That would be "character intent", wouldn't it?  <br/><br/>I would say that "Player intent" is what they're trying to do as a real person.  I think that in general, a player will have some intent outside of the fiction -- rather than only caring about the fiction for fiction's sake.                        </div>

                            Ah, yes - that's what i meant - that you, as a player, will do stuff to work out your character(s) and engage with the game fiction and/or to engage with the other players, "asking" them directly or indirectly to do something. Playing the game, you can and will do both, often simultaneously.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what point i was trying to make in relation to your essay, however.                        </div>

                            Almost any game with a role that is identifiable as the GM will be subject to some degree of GM-decision-making power. If what the players are trying to do and what the GM wants is so confused that it is extremely hard to identify from the in-game fiction and meta-game discussion, then the odds of a disconnect are higher than if it's somehow clear.<br/><br/>In games where the players are mostly in actor-stance, IME, PC-goals and player-goals will line up pretty obviously. In games where there are explicit stakes-setting points then, again, the goals of the players will be obvious. However, in both cases (task and conflict res) there will be conditions where it's less clear (a player working from un-announced author stance where the PC wants to succeed and the player wants to fail, for example. Or a case where stakes-setting is being 'gamed' as some kind of undeclared tactic to try to manipulate the game in an obscure way).<br/><br/>In either case, I think I agree: intent exists at a different level than mechanics. <br/><br/>Now: you could create a hypothetical rule that says you must ALWAYS state your intent as part of the mechanical process and if you lie then you are cheating/not-playing-the-game. I'm not aware of a game with any such rule, but that would seem to make stating intent part of the mechanics (and then, I'd say, assessment of the intent itself).<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>

Side question: Wouldn't obscurement of intent almost always indicate someone veering into a competitive mind-set in some sense? Not by any means PvP exclusively, but it certainly seems like a common competitive tactic and one that I can't see as terribly useful in almost any other context...                        </div>

I don't see that.  For example, it's fairly common to want to set up surprises which are fun for the other participants, but which you don't want to telegraph in advance.  This is most common for the GM, perhaps, but often applies to other players as well.                        </div>

I could see that falling under a kind of "gamist" urge, even in the case of the GM. I'm not talking about a GM trying to beat the players, I'm suggesting that the surprise is a form of the GM "steppin' on up" as it were.<br/><br/>Apologies if this is side-tracking.                        </div>

                            I think deliberate obfusication represents some kind of clandestine agenda by definiton. But the reasons don't have to be competitive per se. It might be embarassment (I want things to come out in terms of X--but that will make me a Mary Sue so I obfsucate my intent behind an appeal to "realism."). It might be surprise (if I get my way here, I can set up something really cool that will take people by surprise in the next scene). It could be that the player wants stuff to happen that others might object to--but which does not bring them directly into conflict with another player in the game.<br/><br/>But, yeah--some kind of hidden agenda, I'd say.<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>
