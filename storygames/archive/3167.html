This made it much easier to give feedback because you could mainly focus on the participants in your own group, and did not have to keep track of them all.<br/><br/>Recently there was a <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23822.0" rel="nofollow">discussion on the Forge</a> about how hard it is to give proper feedback in the First Thoughts forum, and I immediately thought of feedback groups and how they could probably solve some of the problems that were raised in that thread.<br/><br/>The idea is to have a site whereon people can organize themselves into groups, similar to the feedback groups from Game Chef. The people in a group will then be more familiar with each other's games, and will be to some degree committed to give feedback. The site is only to organize the groups; the discussions about the games will happen elsewhere, like on the Forge.<br/><br/>We (I and Lee-Anne O'Reilly) are thinking about making such a site, but before we go to far we really want some feedback on the idea.<br/><br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purposes</span></b><br/><br/>There are two purposes for this idea. The first \xe2\u20ac\u201c and most important \xe2\u20ac\u201c is to make it easier for people to give each other feedback. There are a few reasons why it can be hard to give proper feedback to a game design on a forum:\n<ul><li>You do not understand the silent assumptions that the person makes for his game.</li><li>You can't relate to the type of game the person wants to design.</li><li>You do not know if he is serious about designing the game, or if it is just his \xe2\u20ac\u0153cool idea of the week\xe2\u20ac\x9d.</li><li>You have limited time and resources to devote to feedback, and can't tell from subject lines where best to lend your efforts and interest.</li></ul>\nDesign groups should solve these problems in the following ways:\n<ul><li>A game should be presented from the first concepts, so the other members in the group have followed the game from the start, and therefore have a better understanding of the game.</li><li>People should form groups with like-minded people; people that can relate to the same type of games.</li><li>As a member in a group, you have more commitment to actually finish a game, so the other members know that the time they spend in giving feedback will not be completely lost.</li><li>By referencing the design group descriptions, even non-members can better guess which designs might benefit from their input.</li></ul>\nThe other purpose of the Design Groups is to get people more serious about finishing a game. This is not only a commitment to getting something published, but also a commitment to make a complete, playable-as-written game (another topic that has recently been discussed). Exactly how to achieve this last part is not really well established yet.<br/><br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The site features</span></b><br/><br/>This is an overview of how we imagine the Game Design Group site will work. These are just ideas. Everything here can be questioned and discussed.<br/><br/>The main function of the site is to arrange the members into groups. Each group will have a presentation page where they can have a short description of the games each group member is working on, and maybe some description about what type of game the members in this group are interested in. The basic function is sort of a "mailing-list". When a member wants to present something new about one of the games she is working on, she can notify the others in the group. The actual presentation and discussion will happen other places, like on the Forge (or on Story Game or on a blog - whatever seems more fitting). <br/><br/>If you want to become a member of a design group, you have to go through the following procedure: First you have to browse around the site to find groups that you feel you can relate to (in term of which type of games they are working on), and which have room for more members. Then you will write a form of application that you will post on a forum on the site, and the group that you are interesting in joining will get a notice. There can then be some open dialogue between you and the members of the groups you are interested in, so you can find the right group to join.<br/><br/>In the application you should answer some question about what game(s) you are working on, and what your plans are for this/these game(s). Your answers to these questions should show that you are serious about putting in the work necessary to designing a game.<br/><br/>We have no clear idea yet of how to form new groups, but it will probably also happen through the forum.<br/><br/>Part of the commitment when joining a group, is the commitment to make a thoroughly developed game. To guard against prematurely published games we are thinking about having a way of tagging the games, to show what state they are in, but also to show what still needs to be done. Following are some ideas for tags:\n<ol><li>"First Ideas": You just have some loose ideas about your game.</li><li>"Concept Stage":\n<ul><li>"Concept development": The ideas are structured in rules, and a system begin to emerges </li><li>"Concept playtest": The first playtests to see if the concepts are sound.</li></ul></li><li>"Alpha Stage":<ul><li>"Alpha development": More serious development where you flesh out the concepts and adjust the rules so they fit properly together.</li><li>"Alpha playtest": This is what is called "ashcan version" by some people. You think you have most of the rules nailed down, and the game should be able to deliver a somewhat complete gaming experience.</li></ul></li><li>"Beta Stage":<ul><li>"Beta Development": The rules go through final adjustments.</li><li>"Beta playtest": A last round of playtests just to be sure.</li></ul></li><li>"Final stage": You more or less have the complete text; you just want some last minute feedback before it goes to editing.</li></ol>\nThe "Development" and "Playtest" stages are iterative to put emphasis on playtest as a part of the development cycle. The members of a design group are encouraged to playtest each others' games when they are in alpha stage, and to playtest games from other groups which are in the beta stage. To do playtests is not a requirement, but we are thinking about a system where people get marks for doing playtests, so there will be some social encouragement.<br/><br/>There will probably be a number of other "minor" features. Possibility of uploading documents to make them publicly available. A chat function to have random chit-chat within a group. And probably a resource library with links to game design resources on the internet.<br/><br/>(Continues...)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Larsen" title="Anders Larsen"><img alt="Anders Larsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anders%20Larsen">Anders Larsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72232/#Comment_72232" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T17:01:08+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  5:01PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some last points</span></b><br/><br/>This service is for independent roleplaying games as defined on the Forge. That is: creator owned and self published. There are no restrictions on what type of game can be developed there as long as it fall inside a loose definition of a roleplaying game.<br/><br/>The commitments that have been talked about will not be strongly enforced. If a person wants to drop a game idea to work on another game he is more exited about, it is only the social pressure from the group that may stop him, not something that is hard-coded into the site. The intention is to have the commitment be of a social nature, to, hopefully, keep some flexibility.<br/><br/>We have no intentions of competing with other places (like the Forge or Story-Games); this is a complementary effort to create a better environment for game design.<br/><br/>The service will of course be free.<br/><br/><br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions</span></b>\n<ul><li>Most important: Is this a service that anyone would be interested in?</li><li>Game Chef participants: What about the groups worked well?

Everyones game gets a playtest by not the author group member.<br/>\n1 week to exchange playtest stuff and tweak the game with group feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen once the group gets 5 people that think they can do this you start it. Afterward your group ends and you probably go your separate ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nImagined site features:\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\n<li>Looking for group area with both informal anything goes and set schedule as above.</li>\n<li>Sign up into time slots or group sizes that activate when they have enough people.</li>\n<li>Some kind of scheduling on site.</li>\n<li>A reminder from the system for the schedule</li>\n<li>Feedback form people in the group on what point they are at. In the above you may be required to drop out if you can't keep up as a form of pressure to work at it.</li>\n<li>A system for posting and chat to cover mostly the group formation and organization</li>\n<li>Group management features</li>\n<li>A public made it/didn't make thing. Such as everyone can see your schedule and your progress reports.</li>\n<li>A way to track and link to stuff on other forums by person and project</li>\n<li>Online RPG support in the chat</li>\n<li>Feedback group histories for others to see.</li>\n<li>Perhaps an informal add a comment feature to go with the uploaded documents.</li>\n<li>Some sort of version control. My RPG v1 had these comments. My RPG v2 has these other comments</li>\n<li>Perhaps a ranking system based on successful feedback groups?</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\nThere are enough forums to post stuff to so it seems to me that just making/having a forum isn't that important.<br/>\n<br/>\nA plain wiki could handle all of this. It would allow people to add their names to a list (group singups), have a mode break people out of the lists into groups, have people just show up and make a group, and handle links between other locations as well as people working on the site itself.<br/>\nTo go with Shreyas Q and you A what this does is get people to know each other and make better use of the other resources already out there. It can be fairly self promoting in having people post a link back to it in their other forum discussions. A base of feedback from your site plus general feedback on other sites.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor what I haven't answered already of your Qs.<br/>\n* Most important: Is this a service that anyone would be interested in?<br/>\nYes, for those that want to be driven that little bit extra with some friendly peer pressure. Not sure if there will be enough people like that though.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Will open dialogue to help incomers find a group that fits be any more/less useful than the Forge's First Thoughts forum?<br/>\nTough call. Seems like we might have to wait and see on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n* How can we minimise handling time without sacrificing utility?<br/>\nA combination of automated/mod driven group formations (Put your name in a pool and see who you end up with), self organization (For feedback along these lines apply within), and letting people just show and start a group.<br/>\nPerhaps a work swap section fo the site. I'll proofread yours if you playtest mine?<br/>\n<br/>\n* Are the tagging stages a realistic description of the stages a game design might go through?<br/>\nI think this looks close enough for this project. People may have a number of iterations of a stage or loop back to previous ones, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72270/#Comment_72270" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T23:20:26+00:00" title="May 28, 2007 11:20PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you set this up, I'd love to tell people about it on my design podcast, Master Plan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72300/#Comment_72300" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T03:36:06+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  3:36AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Beat me to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72302/#Comment_72302" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T04:29:07+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  4:29AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 29, 2007 4:29AM by Matthijs.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Does this thread look totally f*ed in your browser?

If I put a post out saying that my "I Might Facestab a Dude" design challenge will start from X and end on Y, then you can manage that group as well.<br><br>But if I say "Hey, I'm looking for five folks to do a times design challenge with," and have to wait until that group's full, then you have to hope your window for being able to commit to that event might pass by before you can get people involved.  I know if I was in this situation, I would aggressively recruit folks so I could keep to the time I'm able to commit -- which means I don't think this site would help me in the way it would mean to.\n<blockquote>[*] Some kind of scheduling on site.</blockquote>\nYou mean, like a calendar of upcoming events?  It would also be cool to see design contents incorporated in this schedule, even if only a link to their site.\n<blockquote>[*] A reminder from the system for the schedule</blockquote>\nI dig this.  I'm also thinking that it would be useful for the organizer to personally ping folks who haven't been active.  In fact, that's part of one of my plans.\n<blockquote>[*] Feedback form people in the group on what point they are at. In the above you may be required to drop out if you can't keep up as a form of pressure to work at it.<br>[*]A system for posting and chat to cover mostly the group formation and organization<br>[*]Group management features</br></br></blockquote>\nI question the need for this.  More below.\n<blockquote>[*]A public made it/didn't make thing. Such as everyone can see your schedule and your progress reports.</blockquote>\nThis is a neat idea, but that also forces any such groups in your system to fit your paradigm.  If I didn't "finish" my Great American RPG, but I made a lot of progress, did I "make it"?  I also things that if groups have different goals (which is reasonable), this binary idea wouldn't really give us any useful data.\n<blockquote>[*]A way to track and link to stuff on other forums by person and project</blockquote>\nI question the need for this.  More below.\n<blockquote>[*]Online RPG support in the chat</blockquote>\nWhat do you mean, exactly?  Will you be able to support my crazy, custom playing card deck that everyone has?  I don't mean to be argumentative here, but if this isn't particularly robust, there would be little utility in not, say, using other chat channels that people already use.\n<blockquote>[*]Feedback group histories for others to see.<br>[*]Perhaps an informal add a comment feature to go with the uploaded documents.<br>[*]Some sort of version control. My RPG v1 had these comments. My RPG v2 has these other comments</br></br></blockquote>\nI question the need for this.  More below.\n<blockquote>[*]Perhaps a ranking system based on successful feedback groups?</blockquote>\nHonestly, I think this is the one feature I would be disinterested in.  That encourages the "game design as a popularity contest" idea.<br><br>So, on the "I question the need for this.  More below." topics:<br><br>It sounds like you want to create a social networking site.  Given that people are going off and doing things like creating Wordpress blogs for their groups, it seems like a site that collected these as a "design group network" is something that we might lack right now more than the infrastructure to get things done once we're in said groups.  Also, since you have a *large* list of wants &amp; ideas here, breaking them down in phases would probably help out your development (even if it's just customizing existing software), and having such a network as your first phase would make a lot of sense.  You could always integrate your own forum/blog/whatever software for individual groups if you see a need for it.<br><br>Also, it would allow for different sorts of groups, from the "Let's sit down and design something this month" to "We're a horror RPG group that welcomes new members all the time, and we don't have a particular deadline."  I don't think the former replaces First Thoughts, because that's about "Hey, I have an idea that I want to bounce off of folks" rather than "Hey, I'm going to participate in something right now."<br><br>That's my two cents right now.  I really dig this idea -- my criticisms are there because I'd love to see this succeed.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146562/#Comment_146562" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T21:26:57+00:00" title="May 28, 2008  9:26PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2008 9:32PM by Kuma.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>You guys know about the<a href="http://omegakitchen.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Omega Kitchen</a>,HQ Unicron, andSecret Wars, right?

I thought about doing this sort of thing (I called it Ludolab, back in the day), and my solution was to create an investment system that paralleled the collaboration system.<br><br/>You create a project, and it has a number of Shares attached to it (1000 shares).  You then assign bounties to various tasks: let's say you have a basic idea, but need help fleshing it out.  You set a bounty for Result X, and when someone fulfills that result (giving the game a thorough critique, for example, or 3 pieces of art), the collaborator gets the bounty.  When the project is finished and goes to 'print', whatever that means, the shares will generate income based on the percentage.  Shares could also be traded internally to purchase copies of a game, etc., giving them an internal value regardless of whether the project ever launches.<br/><br/>But the problem with these sorts of collaborations is simple, and so is the solution: Why should I invest hours of time on your project that may never see the light of day, when I could be spending that on my own projects?  It doesn't make any economic sense - so, incentivize participation and maximize the potential that these projects will come to fruition.<br/><br/>Edit, to address Ryan's post: A reputation system is key to any site like this.  But you're also right that the types of projects you're active in are a good data point.  I'd suggest a weighted system for reputation, with keeping up on more 'serious' projects weighing more in your reputation score than keeping current with your casual group.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
