But that would take a lot of work.  Like, right now, the ENies mostly focus on major publishers, the Indie RPG Awards handle small press stuff, and the Origins Awards suck.  The closest thing is the Diana Jones Awards nominees, which include a pretty diverse group of things, but there's only one award (and, like Game Chef, the winner doesn't really matter).<br/><br/>Another idea would be to reward people instead of products, like Time's "Man of the Year" bullshit, but really interesting.<br/><br/>Or you could do something really idiosyncratic, like Ken Hites's Outies, which gave out awards for like Most Idiosyncratic Game (The Roach won that one in 2006, I think).<br/><br/>Awards should do one of two things in my mind: 1) honor stuff that most people would agree is really good, or 2) pick some good stuff that most people wouldn't notice and bring it to their attention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146236/#Comment_146236" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T13:30:36+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  1:30PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham Walmsley,<br/><br/>Gencon wouldn't be my ideal. Let's say it's a local or regional convention, with 1-5 neighboring cities in attendance.<br/><br/>I would hold the "Play Awards", which would break down into the following:<br/><br/><b>Most Energetic At The Table</b><br/>This award is given to the most dynamic, tour-de-force, exciting person to have at a gaming table. This could be a GM or a player. The ideal candidate will involve others in a shared excitement, bringing the spirit and investment of everyone at the table up a notch.<br/><br/><b>Best Historical Gamer</b><br/>This award goes to the gamer who has best captured a real historical time and place at the table. This award could be for a GM or a player, for a one-shot scenario or a historical campaign. The ideal candidate will blend accurate historical portrayals with accesible support for other players in the game, making it possible for everyone to pay tribute to a real world situation or period.<br/><br/><b>Best Prep</b><br/>This award goes to the person who best tackles pre-game preparation. This award would likely be for a GM. Prep could be in the form of hand-outs, props, settings, scenarios, NPCs or tactical situations, dependant on the particular game(s). The ideal candidate would use prepared materials to kickstart a game and support it along the way, without confining or limited players with "the script".<br/><br/><b>Best Prep-less</b><br/>This award goes to the gamer who best tackles no-prep gaming. This might include teaching the rules, invention situations on the fly, improvising, and dealing with surprising or unexpected situations in a game. The ideal candidate would be able to run a game at the drop of a hat, improvise a scenario without any pre-planning, and carry out in-character dialogue without a lot of pause or scripting.<br/><br/><b>Best At The Table</b><br/>An all-around best gamer to have at the table.<br/><br/>I would have people nominate in advance of the convention by sending in a paragraph description of the person. If multiple nominations came in for a single name in the same category, I would pick the best one to put on the ballot. Con "loot bags" would include the voting ballot, which would list the nominations and paragraph highlights for each person for each category.<br/><br/>Any gamer that recognized a name and wanted to give it props could drop off a ballot by Sunday morning, 10am. The awards would be given out at the end of Sunday. There would also be a random draw out of all the voters, so that there was an added incentive to drop off a ballot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146240/#Comment_146240" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T13:38:30+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  1:38PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.

For that, you need to set up a formal means to nominate something (a web form is dirt-easy), rules for nominations (can you nominate your own stuff?  can you nominate more than one thing?), and a deadline.  Then you promote it.<br/><br/>Find three judges at most (and if you're one of them, that means just two people).  Set up some simple criteria and a rubric for scoring.  I repeat: set up a rubric for scoring.  Judges need to see examples of what you're talking about, rather than be told "rate on scale of 1-10."  What does a 5 mean?  And so on.  Give your judges the rubric and a deadline.  And, of course, whatever is being judged.<br/><br/>Now, the free stuff awards would be easy at this point, because you can easily get copies of the nominations to them -- all the stuff is free, after all.  If we're otherwise talking about products, then you need to get them donated by their publishers, and that's something of a hassle.  Especially for awards that are new and haven't been held before.  If you're talking about players or lifetime achievements, then you're going to have to figure some way to represent those players or lifetimes to your judges.  Good luck!<br/><br/>And then figure out when and where you're handing out awards, and do so.<br/><br/>Simple!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146307/#Comment_146307" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T20:19:02+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  8:19PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a perfect world?

Fourth, judges may decide to run any of these games that they want to.  Rank in order of "run first".<br/>5. Finally, any judge that ran more than one game may rank them, highest to lowest, in order of "I want to run this again".<br/><br/>Anyone can compete.
