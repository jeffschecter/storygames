"Don't worry about how to do X. It says so right here. You worry about fun stuff like names and descriptions." But that stuff starts to disappear from the playtest doc at the transition between the interlude and Action Scene 2. <br/><br/>So what I'd like to see here is a) what have you been doing for Scene 2 specifically, and b) what kinds of procedures could the game provide without being too restraining. <br/><br/>Have you created threats based on finding clues or questioning suspects, or sneaking around? How did that work? How many threats did you include in the scene?<br/><br/>One suggestion I have is to call Scene 2 something else, like the "Investigation Scene." Really establish it as something different from what happens at the beginning.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220766/#Comment_220766" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-26T06:42:20+00:00" title="July 26, 2009  6:42AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 26, 2009 12:54PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've played twice, and each session had an intro, and interlude, and a second scene, which wrapped up the adventure and the evening.

Each player narrated some kind of new twist or discovery into their Interludes and I used them to generate the action for the Mystery Scene.<br/><br/>P1 Interlude: The Detective caught wind of a missing biomatter container on a recent shipment to Rocket City, that could be how the Crimson Spy sneaked onto Mars. His Interlude ended with him on the way to the Dock 7.<br/>P2 Interlude: Investigating a rumor about a Crimson/Stygian alliance, the Explorer headed to a secret base on Pluto and found a Giant Ray Gun Pointed at Earth!<br/>P3 Interlude: The Professor was in his lab when his secretary came in with a message, "Someone named Victor Prime called while you were out, Doc. Said it was urgent."<br/><br/>The Mystery Scene started with P1 at the docks, P2 inside the base, and P3 at Prime's Pub. I set up some initial threats for each. P1 had an Obstinate Foreman and 'Where's the Spy?' P2 had to remove the Crimson Guards before he could tackle 'The Gun's Dark Purpose!' P3 was up against Victor Prime, Prime's Goons and 'Where's He Holding the Hostage?'<br/><br/>I wanted at least a bit of action in the scenes, or at least the possibility of it, but I tried to make the main crux of the scenes investigation. Danger started subtle at first with the players adding dangers like "the foreman's getting edgy, one wrong move and he may get tired of my questions" and "Everyone knows Prime's office is trapped, the kingpin doesn't bring anyone to his lair without keeping the upperhand." Of course, the danger spiraled into pulpy insanity from there. Seventeen elementary school kids lay dead after a building exploded on them and that was the lesser of two evils! :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson" title="Matt Wilson"><img alt="Matt Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dog-eared-designs.com/img/goaticon2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Wilson">Matt Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220812/#Comment_220812" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-26T13:34:23+00:00" title="July 26, 2009  1:34PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jarvis: Yeah.

You get through the rules and the first Action scene and have your Interludes.  Then you/the rules/the designer may want to "dial it back" for the second conflict/investigation/mystery scene in interest of pacing, but may run short on time, especially if the players are having some bad luck and are Stunned a lot.<br/><br/>One thing that will probably help is dialing back the recommended opposition in the first scene from what most people have been doing up to now.  If the players steamroll the opposition in the first round you can either decide that's okay or add in a couple more Threats.<br/><br/>I think 2nd or 3rd sessions with players that know the rules, along with a few more rules tweaks will (should?) eventually fall into a natural Action Scene/Interlude/Mystery Scene/Interlude/Final Action Scene arc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220816/#Comment_220816" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-26T14:06:42+00:00" title="July 26, 2009  2:06PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's dead-on perfect, Jarvis.

A character alone is vulnerable.<br/><br/>Which brings me to another possible suggestion.  I think it's good that there are hit defaults for the Threat Levels, but having 1-3 hits be Normal, 4-6 be Major, etc. might be a suggestion under Other Stuff.<br/><br/>When Rascal Jack is all by himself and he's telegraphed the next scene might include Clio Meow who we may already know is at least a Major Threat, and we also know he's dealing with his Fear of Being Captured, the current rules only allow for a minimum of a 3 hit Threat.  It would be nice, and add mystery/suspense, if a GM felt like they had the option of having Clio be a 5 hit Threat and his Fear be a 1 or 2 hit Threat.<br/><br/>This would give the GM more flexibility during conflicts.  A fight is spinning out of control and a newly introduced Threat has only received 2 hits from an unlucky character?  Decide that Threat was a 2 Hit Threat and take it off the table!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220878/#Comment_220878" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T04:18:28+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  4:18AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2009 4:24AM by Jarvis.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Wilson</cite>Were the threats for these scenes just level one threats?</blockquote> Yeah. Most of them were only level 1 Threats, but a few of them were timed ("Where's the Spy?" had a 1 round limit before she escaped) or staged (Crimson Guards made discerning the Gun's Purpose difficult).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>Clio Meow who we may already know is at least a Major Threat</blockquote> You know, that's the same mental trap I was in during the Action Scene. That's the brain mold from too many years of pre-Danger gaming gettin' you all befuddled. You gotta let that shit go man! Threats in Danger Patrol aren't constrained by archaic gaming logic. Threats are as free form and unrestrained as the Shapeshifting Bugbeasts of Cabarra 4!<br/><br/>Let me give you an example. I made the silly mistake of writing Victor Prime on the Threat Marker, making Prime himself the Threat and therefore only removed when Prime himself was 'removed'. I realized that necessitated Prime being a Master Threat since he was set up as a major underworld boss. About halfway through the Mystery Scene, I realized this was going to take a while and something clicked. <br/><br/>There was no reason the Threat needed to be Prime himself. The Threat could just as easily be Prime's Waning Patience, Victor's Bargain, The Professor's Resolve, etc and these could easily be Level 1 or 2. Sure the ruler of Rocket City's criminal underground is a Master Threat, but it's a good thing he's only mildly interested in kidnapping your girlfriend. :-)<br/><br/>Not only does this allow you to scale super villain scenes to what feels right at the moment, but it also allows the villain to make its escape since it was never actually a Threat at all. The Threat is really what the situation is about and the situation is rarely about this or that villain. It's almost always their plans or schemes!!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220913/#Comment_220913" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T07:19:31+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  7:19AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2009 7:19AM by Scott.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a quick thought, the GM and Player sequence in Mouse Guard may have some good ideas for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220949/#Comment_220949" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T09:25:51+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  9:25AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jarvis</cite>Not only does this allow you to scale super villain scenes to what feels right at the moment, but it also allows the villain to make its escape since it was never actually a Threat at all.
