It'd be a sort of proof of concept.<br/><br/>I'm wondering if I should do a shoot em up, or a game which can be played on a table top. I'm kind of inclined to writing a mechanic which could work on a table, should the proof of concept hit it's mark. But at the same time, space invader style shoot 'em ups are easy to make fun, while something that works on table top and has some type of fun factor isn't impossible, but it's harder (and this is a proof of concept). So, easy and makes the project more likely to be completed yet wont work on the table, or harder and the project might burn out, but will work on the table? Thoughts?<br/><br/>I was also wondering about the GM roll here. Initially I was thinking that there's the player, and he just calls over whoevers handy, describes his move, they give a number between the min and max, and that's it. But it feels kind of...I dunno, short changing the impromptu GM - they don't get anything out of it. I was thinking perhaps there's perhaps a few little nice graphics (perhaps semi cool scenery shots) and for rating the players move, they get to see them or get a chance at seeing them (gamble fun) or something.<br/><br/>Also I'm thinking there should be some random element to the number the GM gives. So perhaps the number he gives determines a number of dice, like 4 points = 4D6. The end number gives the moves power. That way the player doesn't just see the GM give a low number and go 'Eh, that's it'. Fate still has a hand even at this point.<br/><br/>Finally, the whole idea probably goes against just about everyones core roleplay values, hehe! I've heard people say 'The fiction should inform rules use'. Basically here the fiction of the guys described move determines only a number, not what rules are used, and then it ceases to be interested in the fiction anymore - just play out the pure mechanics of the game with that value plugged in. Heh, it'll probably be an abomination to most peoples aesthetic - but it was good to type out what I'm thinking about here, it helps <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158022">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158022/#Comment_158022" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-22T23:26:20+00:00" title="July 22, 2008 11:26PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See, I'm not all that talented. I do this stuff 'cause I think it's fun and I just hope to get lucky. So this question might be a little stupid:<br/><br/>Are you talking about pitting the GM's skill against the player's skill? I mean, are going to create some sort of engine where the GM manipulates, say, hordes of sprites while the player picks them off? <br/><br/>Or is it result vs result, with the GM picking a number from a range of values and the player hitting a button on his end which generates a random value to be compared with the GM?  It kinda sounds like you want to do this obliquely, hiding the actual values behind graphics. If so, you could just have a bunch of flat images which have random effects to show that SOMETHING has happened or NOTHING has happened. If you wanted to, you could have more spectacular special effects for something on a higher scale of SOMETHING. <br/><br/>For instance, you might have an illustration of a door, a machine, a monster or a smiley face for the GM to choose from. The GM toggles this and inputs a target value. On the player's side, the player can tick off skills that he or she wants to use in, oh, say check boxes or radio buttons. The player activates his or her form and your program generates a random number based on the dice that were assigned to each checkbox value. The program then compares the number to the GM's target number and both participants see a quick graphic representation. Perhaps the GM sees the actual scores compared.<br/><br/>Perhaps there's a small textbox underneath for chatting. It would be even weirder if you used abstract, semiotic-type symbols and special effects.<br/><br/>Will the GM need to create some sort of map for the players' sprites to move upon? Can the GM create the map as he or she goes along? Like, use the old idea of a chipset and just let the GM paint a cheesey landscape for the players to see. In other words, it would look more like an early Final Fantasy or Legend of Zelda or Earthbound or Disgaia kind of thing? Or is it first person POV?<br/><br/>If it's first person POV, is there any environment at all, or are there just things to interact with, like a black box set in theatre?<br/><br/>Also, I don't understand what proof of concept means in computer game lingo. I know what it means in regard to boring old logic, but I really don't understand what you're talking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158386/#Comment_158386" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-24T10:53:52+00:00" title="July 24, 2008 10:53AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'm having trouble following this, too, and I do computer game design and work as a professional software developer. <br/><br/>Callan, if you have something in mind for the interface, can you comp it up in Paint or PhotoShop or something and show us a screen shot and walk us, step by step, through an instance of play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158389/#Comment_158389" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-24T10:59:04+00:00" title="July 24, 2008 10:59AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, also check out Jonathan Walton's <i>Waiting/Tea</i> mini-RPG in <i>PUSH volume 1</i>.

Guy at the bottom shooting bullets up, baddies at the top shooting bullets down? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I was interested in perhaps making something that could be played on a table top, but I don't know what that'd look like. I don't strictly have anything in mind yet, except "a conflict that will resolve (and the way it will resolve is fairly uncertain during play itself)". Space invaders style play is one way to meet that goal. Not sure how to meet it on the table top easily, except in canabalising an existing game.<br/><br/>After setting up that base of conflict, then I'm considering how to modify it by adding a sample of imagined space. In terms of a space invaders style game, I was thinking of bomb style attack. You must have all played a shoot 'em up at some point, and apart from the fire key, it had a button for a huge bomb type attack?<br/><br/>Anyway, I was thinking that bombs strength, instead of being preset, would be based on the GM's rating of a move. Lets say rather than space invaders, it's the maverick good guy cop at the bottom shooting bullets up into suited 80's style goons at the top (who are shooting down)*. There are various, literally random bits of furniture graphics spread around the play area (cabinets, computer terminals, water cooler, fruit cart (there's always a fruit cart in the 80's action flicks!)). They are purely graphical and just colour. <br/><br/>BUT, when you first hit the bomb button, the game goes on pause and you describe to the GM how you would use those furnishings to do a super 80's action flick style move to kick ass. Or maybe it would be more practical, more methodical. You might appeal to genre, or practicality, or whatever - that's that whole SIS thing going between you and the GM. THEN the next step is that the GM rates it. <br/><br/>If I may briefly rant for a second, this isn't like so many games where the GM can supposedly set a difficulty number at any value, but in actual fact he sets it too high he's treated like a social pariah (and that's seen as comfortable gameplay, somehow, by thousands of gamers). Under my design goal, he chooses a number between a minimum and maximum - lets say he chooses a number from 1 to 10. That determines the bombs strength. If he says your move is a one, you don't judge his morals and the rest of the stuff that seems to happen in 'normal' gaming - you can chit chat in hope of moving the number, but he can call an end to the chit chat and at that point the number chosen is the number accepted graciously by all.<br/><br/>Hmm, I did rant a bit! There's some stuff I'm trying to get away from there, that I consider toxic - sorry if it made the description harder to read. Anyway, the rating determines the bombs strength - how many baddies the special move key will kill! Yay! Once you have that value, the shoot em up continues and releases that attack. There will be a recharge time between each use of the bomb key, but basically you don't ask the GM anything else, the game just uses the value plugged into it from now until game end/resolution of the play session. As you can see, the game only samples the imagined space just the once.<br/><br/>Hope that explains it a bit more. I noticed it wasn't easy to conceptualise, so I started coding a shoot em up. Pretty much finished the basic shoot 'em up code except for actually killing baddies or getting killed yourself, so far.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* Partly because that's what I've started coding already, but in a minimalist graphical style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158465/#Comment_158465" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-24T20:17:11+00:00" title="July 24, 2008  8:17PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, just finished coding the chassis, ie the basic shoot em up framework.
