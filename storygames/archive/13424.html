It's a bit of an info dump but can really help people understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Make sure the endgame rules are clear - at most one can escape into the night, everybody else either burns or repents, full stop.<br/><br/>Be prepared to help frame the introductory scene at the inn as facilitator - I've seen people be at sea about how to approach this, not really understanding the game's dynamic yet. Let them know the important thing is making a thematic statement about their character that they can explore, revisit, and challenge. How far will they go? What will they do? What moral lines will they cross? The ultimate outcome isn't particularly important, but these questions are.<br/><br/>Have fun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/R00kie" title="R00kie"><img alt="R00kie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/R00kie">R00kie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302559/#Comment_302559" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-29T05:27:17+00:00" title="November 29, 2010  5:27AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The sweet spot is 6 players. 5 is pretty good too.<br/><br/>Advice? Yeah. Make sure you print lots of copies of the relationship map (ideally one per player). Also make sure the players understand the significance of their primary and secondary character before they frame their first scene. <br/><br/>If there is a player with experience of the game allow them to frame the opening inn scene. I would be tempted to order the players so the most experienced players get to frame scenes early and those who don't know the game get to see it done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302561/#Comment_302561" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-29T05:30:48+00:00" title="November 29, 2010  5:30AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Excellent, I just did the scheduling for the minicon, and we'll be six when we play.<br/><br/>Noone has played Montsegur 1244 before, but we have some veteran indie gamers, I'll make them go first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frederik%20J.%20Jensen" title="Frederik J.

There isn't much for an Montsegur facilitator to do once things get rolling, and this will give you a chance to demonstrate the game's features in actual play.<br/><br/>Be sure to demonstrate the scene cards in play.  There's a lot of juice in their scene-stealing powers, but it's easy to overlook them.<br/><br/>I second Jason's recommendation about lumping the exposition.  It's important that the Cathar material come out as early as possible. The Cathars are weird and consolamentum can be a fun thing to bring up in early acts.  I usually just dispense with Raimonde's reading entirely and describe Montsegur simply as a near-impregnable fortress on a bluff.  This makes time for Cecile's and Bertrand's readings.<br/><br/>Because the Cathars are so alien and strange and the Perfects so isolated on the r-map, it is easy for the religious elements in the game to be disregarded, which seems a shame.  Except for the Perfects, the game doesn't specify who is really a Cathar and who is not.  I've had good times making this an issue in game play by having a character explicitly affirm or deny their belief, or challenge another character's beliefs.<br/><br/>Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_302607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302607/#Comment_302607" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-29T12:36:30+00:00" title="November 29, 2010 12:36PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>I usually just dispense with Raimonde's reading entirely and describe Montsegur simply as a near-impregnable fortress on a bluff.

You can still circulate the information cards for people to read during down time, of course. <br/><br/>If I implied that you'd facilitate without also playing that's my mistake - definitely, definitely do both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_302752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/302752/#Comment_302752" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-30T22:43:04+00:00" title="November 30, 2010 10:43PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2010 10:43PM by Wilhelm.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: Facilitating games, just a term I have used when I run GM-less games at cons.
