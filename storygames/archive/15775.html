In fiction, the characters have to struggle to get what they want.<br/><br/>If RPG rules force the characters to struggle, that's a game, right?<br/><br/>But hold on!  The players <i>want</i> their characters to struggle because RPG play <i>is</i> fiction!  So the rules are just giving the players what they wanted, <i>without</i> a struggle.<br/><br/>In order to turn an RPG into a struggle, the rules have to at least threaten to <i>not</i> give the players what they wanted.<br/><br/>Look at your RPG play.  Think about what you want out of the fiction.  I don't mean whatever you might want on your character's behalf at any given moment.  I mean, what kind of fiction do you want to come out of a whole session?  <br/><br/>Now, do you want to have to struggle to get that?  Do you want to fail, learn, and try again?  Do you even want failure to be a possibility?<br/><br/>Sometimes I do.<br/><br/>But often -- <i>quite</i> often, really -- I don't.<br/><br/>These different answers strike me as representing two very different activities!  I suspect their design considerations are similarly distinct.  More on that below.<br/><br/><b>A note on struggles, time, and conflict:</b><br/><br/>If you're used to thinking and talking about this stuff in terms of conflict, then when I say "struggle", just think "conflict that can't be quickly and easily resolved".  Many RPG rules are aimed at creating conflict, and many more are aimed at turning a conflict into a struggle by sustaining it against easy resolution.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357965/#Comment_357965" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T03:35:23+00:00" title="February  6, 2012  3:35AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2012 3:35AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The activity that's not a struggle</b><br/><br/>I think a lot of roleplaying groups don't want this kind of struggle.  Envision a Call of Cthulhu game.  Everyone there, players and keeper alike, want a certain kind of fiction.  They want anxiety, and creepiness, and discovery, and revelation, and horror, and madness, more or less in that sequence.  Do they want the characters to struggle?  Yes!  But do they want to struggle to tell a story of anxious creepy horrific maddening revelation?  My guess would be, no.<br/><br/>I think this is perfectly fine, agreeing to produce such fiction without struggling at it.  I think it's quite fun, taking some book content, and my friends' brains, and my brain, and seeing how our version of creepy maddening horror turns out.  Where exactly will we lead the tale, and what will we be inspired to contribute?<br/><br/>Heck, making up cool fiction in real time for an audience is already a struggle!  I'm going to be quite satisfied if I pull it off, even without some rules opposing me.<br/><br/>So, when we're playing that way -- whether you call it a game or not -- what do we want the rules to do?<br/><br/>We want the rules to only produce outcomes that accommodate anxiety, and creepiness, and discovery, and revelation, and horror, and madness, more or less in that sequence.  That's the baseline.  We probably want to aim higher and replace "accommodate" with "facilitate", but the absolute minimum requirement is that the rules don't interfere with us doing what we came here to do.<br/><br/>If the rules do interfere, we have two options.  We can either find a better ruleset -- which takes time, effort, and money -- or we can simply assert the true purpose of our activity on the spot, and say, "No," to the rule.<br/><br/>In this context, if made part of the social contract, Rule Zero is not dysfunctional at all.  It is in fact a quite practical way of dealing with an imperfect tool (the interfering ruleset) for the task at hand.<br/><br/>Now, suppose you think <i>most</i> roleplayers fall in this camp.  And suppose you want to design a product for them.  You are <i>not</i> going to give them what they want via traditional game design, which aims for real player struggle, or through traditional RPG design, which tends to conflate character struggle with player struggle.  What you really need to give them is a top-notch process for creative collaboration that frames and surrounds everything, and then maybe a subsystem for character struggles within that.  I think time has proven that stopping at "here's some inspiring setting content; one of you controls the world and the rest play characters; go!" does not qualify as "top notch".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357967/#Comment_357967" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T04:06:49+00:00" title="February  6, 2012  4:06AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2012 4:44AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The activity that is a struggle</b><br/><br/>Sometimes I am in the mood to take my love of roleplaying to a proper game.  I don't want my desires to come easy.  I want challenge, or calculated risks, or blind gambles, or competition with another player.  Or at the very least I want some suspense created by threats that at least seem credible.<br/><br/>Want to make a game like that?  Now you're doing traditional game design.  <br/><br/>You have to include some things that the player does <i>not</i> want to happen.  You have to find the right level of likelihood and the right level of unwelcomeness.  If bad stuff practically never happens, or isn't really that bad, it ceases to function as a challenge or threat.  If bad stuff happens all the time, or if your bad stuff is <i>too</i> bad, then your players may not be able to overcome their disappointment and continue.<br/><br/>Keeping with the Cthulhu example, imagine a game where you and your friends sit down together to <i>try</i> and tell a tale of creepy maddening horror, confronted by rules that threaten to hide the revelations, leave the characters sane, or kill everyone and end the game before the tale is complete!  Now there's something on the line here!<br/><br/>Maybe I pursue my preferred outcome with my full tactical faculties, or maybe I just await the face of the rolling die, or maybe it's a mix of both.  Maybe my opposition is the ruleset, or another player pursuing opposed goals, or both.  In any case, I'm engaged in a struggle, for real, as me, with true consequences on the line.<br/><br/>I'd like to note that the relationship between player struggle and in-fiction character struggle is wide open.  The two struggles can be unrelated or they can be one and the same.  Heck, if you can make a compelling enough game, maybe we shouldn't even assume that its fiction needs much character struggle!<br/><br/>Some thoughts on when the two struggles <i>are</i> aligned:<br/>- If you can simultaneously (a) strive for a real player goal and (b) embody your character striving for a much more dramatic goal, that's pretty sweet.<br/>- I think the player's game objective probably needs to be a certain character outcome, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357971/#Comment_357971" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T04:35:49+00:00" title="February  6, 2012  4:35AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2012 5:02AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Player versus player struggles</b><br/><br/>Above, I'm trying to distinguish between player struggles and character struggles.  I think that distinction is particularly important when it comes to player versus player and character versus character.<br/><br/>Let's say your character and mine are fighting.  I see 3 options:<br/><br/>1) If our game is not a struggle, perhaps we're both creating a story with protagonist animosity.  Maybe we can agree on which character wins!  The only rules we need here are direct communication rules.<br/><br/>2) But maybe neither of us want our <i>own</i> character to get beaten up right at this moment; we'd rather the <i>other</i> player's character go down.  <br/><br/>Similarly, if our game <i>is</i> a struggle, and we're on a team, both <i>trying</i> to create a story with protagonist animosity, then we could well differ on whose character ought to lose.<br/><br/>In both of these cases, we either need an rule that gets us an impartial and big-picture-suitable outcome, or we need a rule that gets us as players to agree on which character should lose.  Though neither outcome (your character gets beaten up, or mine does) is <i>severely</i> unwelcome (as both fit our overall goal), we still need a way to determine what happens.  Now we probably need rules that impact the fiction directly.<br/><br/>3) Compare that to if our game is a struggle and you and I are <i>competing</i>.  What we want the rules to do is make it so the best (or luckiest) player wins.  Either I beat you or you beat me, and the characters' fight is a vehicle for that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357979/#Comment_357979" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T06:29:39+00:00" title="February  6, 2012  6:29AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Now, suppose you think<i>most</i>roleplayers fall in this camp.

It's a matter of player expectation of story and genre versus what is supported by the design - and any game that sequences character events presents a genre of story, even if it barely resembles anything literary or cinematic. <br/><br/>Forcing Sorcerer to provide you a Harlequin romance between you and your demon* is just as much a discrepancy as expecting old school D&amp;D to provide an epic hero's tale. In both cases, you need to struggle against the system. What I find really interesting is the idea that this struggle may be a fully legitimate play style that can be very fun with the right crowd - that's a very exciting thesis.<br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/><br/>* Which is a reasonable expectation just looking at the main book's cover.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358019/#Comment_358019" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T10:08:41+00:00" title="February  6, 2012 10:08AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David,<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, you're assuming that the things that naturally happen during a game:<br/>\n<br/>\n-of the kind you bought and made PCs for, and<br/>\n-run with the group you chose to roll with<br/>\n<br/>\n...isn't automatically satisfying.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if not, that's weird. <br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, there's a difference between "Maximum Satisfying Possible" (which I don't think is any more plannable than The Best Ever Conversation In History) and "satisfying".<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously a storm of external and internal troubles can create an occasional off-day even for a well-oiled group but in general if just playing period with those people isn't satisfying I don't think the problem is game design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358025/#Comment_358025" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T10:25:53+00:00" title="February  6, 2012 10:25AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2012 10:32AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel,<br/><br/>Yeah, I wasn't thinking indie / trad / OSR / whatever at all when I started this.  Certain trad game play patterns just wound up making perfect examples.  I really think a lot of groups' games are hamstrung by not acknowledging that they don't <i>want</i> to struggle <i>as players</i>.  Having <i>not</i> acknowledged that, they wind up kind of half acting on it, mostly when it doesn't violate the other expectations they've been saddled with.  Like, when a certain thing needs to happen in order for us to all get what we want out of the evening, why are we rolling dice for it?  Does anyone realize that's a bad idea before it's too late?  If so, do they feel permitted to assert that?<br/><br/>As for enjoying struggle, I was thinking less of trying to force a game that's suited for one thing into doing another thing (although that certainly is <i>interesting</i>), and more of playing a game that subordinates fiction-oriented goals to (possibly competing) game goals.<br/><br/>Like, let's say you're playing Dogs in the Vineyard and you feel like you're building up to a dramatic showdown to determine the town's fate, but then another player decides your actions are immoral, shoots you, and the dice say you die.  Do you say, "Well, I knew I might not get the arc I wanted; it would have been all the sweeter if I had; I'm content adhering to the outcomes of the system, and I hope to do better next time"?  Or do you say, "Dude, don't shoot me; that's not cool, I'll miss the dramatic showdown!"?  Dogs works because it doesn't promise or rely on the fiction going a particular way beyond a very general "If you do nothing, stuff gets worse."  But I think a lot of games, like Call of Cthulhu, do promise and rely on more than that.<br/><br/>I'll admit, I'm having trouble drawing a firm line on this.  "We want a dramatic showdown" is probably not the best example of a metric for the success of a session's fiction, but I hope it's close enough to illustrate the point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358027/#Comment_358027" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T10:30:24+00:00" title="February  6, 2012 10:30AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zak,<br/><br/>That's why I specified "satisfying <i>fictional</i> outcome".

You've articulated your points in a good, and clear, way. I just hope you're OK with the thread turning into a rehash of a certain popular Story Games discussion (which it will, and has, since you didn't ask any specific questions). Of course, there's nothing wrong with that! <br/><br/>So, without further ado:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zak S</cite>Like, do you ever have an elf and a thief and a wizard and they go to kill a dragon in fake-Europe and it "isn't medieval fantasy"?<br/><br/>Or, to use your example, everything in a Cthulhu is going to be as creepy or funny, pretty much no matter what, that's not a "maybe" situation.<br/><br/>Put simply "the brand of game + the brand of players = a kind of story"</blockquote>\nIt sounds like your approach to playing a game (as described in these few words) is to pick up a game, play it, and have fun finding out what the result is like. "Hey, we made characters and confronted a monster and we all got killed! Cool!"<br/><br/>That's a very valid way to play games, I think. However, as Dave is pointing out, it's not the only way. Not only because people have certain preferences and certain interests, but also because games are marketed a certain way, and they make certain claims.<br/><br/>Have you really never seen a player or a group pick up a game that says, "Play larger-than-life heroes in your own fantasy epic!", only to roll a few dice and have the "heroes" killed by a rat's bite in the first room of the dungeon? <br/><br/>Some people love that. They go, "Cool!" They roll up new characters and they go at it again, looking forward to see how they'll die THIS time, or maybe to see if they can outmaneuver the rat somehow.<br/><br/>But other people, their reaction is: "What the hell? That wasn't anything like a fantasy epic at all. I didn't feel like a hero. I was supposed to be "a Wizard Hero!" and all I could do was cast one spell which could lock a door, which was completely irrelevant to the story." And, more importantly (since you might argue their disappointment is based on a misunderstanding of the game itself, whoever's fault that may be), they <i>have no idea what they can do to get what they want out of the game</i>, instead.<br/><br/>That's pretty frustrating! You sit there, staring at the books which proclaim a "Heroic Fantasy Epic", and you have no idea what you did wrong. Why didn't it work?<br/><br/>By the same token, for many people, saying "we're going to play a game where we investigate a Lovecraft-esque Mythos mystery!" does not mean "everything is going to be funny or creepy". To those guys and girls, "it is going to be funny" isn't a pleasant surprise but a failure. They signed up for the creepy, after all!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S" title="Zak S"><img alt="Zak S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zak%20S">Zak S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358045/#Comment_358045" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T11:25:16+00:00" title="February  6, 2012 11:25AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2012 11:29AM by Zak S.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Have you really never seen a player or a group pick up a game that says, "Play larger-than-life heroes in your own fantasy epic!", only to roll a few dice and have the "heroes" killed by a rat's bite in the first room of the dungeon?

It raises a lot of interesting points.<br/><br/>I think that the mechanical struggle - the struggle a player makes on a meta-game level - and the fictional struggle to create the game's narrative through the characters should be united. Roleplaying games are effective where the written rules act as a vehicle to tell the story. I say the written rules, because from the perspective of a general analysis of games, roleplaying games have two other kinds of rules. The first are the social rules of conduct established at a group level. These are important, but it's hard to say anything general about them - I think they play into the micro level design as expectations and preconceptions. The second are the hidden rules of the game environment in the mind of the GM. It's this set of rules (somewhat sociocultural also) that put roleplaying games in the narrow class of non-software games with hidden rules. Most pen and paper games have procedural rules of interaction that everyone knows. If they don't know the exact result of each move they control, they have the capacity to work out the rough probability distribution of the outcomes (such as in the case of drawing a card.) In software games, on the other hand, the rules are typically a highly secretive generative machine that processes information very quickly. The players explore the game world without knowing how it works or what will happen. This kind of software game does not require an electronic computer, but great density of calculation and reorganization of information is made possible by the use of one. In roleplaying games, the hidden rules of interaction are in the mind of a culturally-situated person with a lot of knowledge and a very very powerful computer on the other side of their skull. Since we can't simulate a person or enculturate a computer, this is what (from my perspective) separates roleplaying games from other sorts of games. The only game I know of that blurs the line is Sleep is Death, which is a software and roleplaying game that generates comics.<br/><br/>That was a bit of a wild tangent, so what's my point? To completely formalise the players' struggle and then overlay the characters struggle would almost transform the roleplaying game into a software game. It wouldn't prevent it from being a roleplaying game - what is a roleplaying is a social definition - but it does, I think, discard one of the more unique and interesting features of the form. To unite the mechanics in creating narrative, it's useful to have rules that integrate well with storytelling and evaluate quickly. It's also very useful to become able to discard plot in favour of giving players choice. This brings me to struggle.<br/><br/>The games where I've really struggled, and I think struggle is something our group has a tendency towards, are the games where I haven't known what to do. At the moment in our fantasy game, we're stuck in a really bad situation, two factions are going to war and we hold a key piece of the puzzle, which they're both after. We've been paid and could feasibly run for it, but we'd have the lives of a lot of people (both sides) on our hands. Both would probably rather like to kill us. The GM has no hints for us and has plans for pretty much all of our options. It's really grim and we have spent a lot of time just deconstructing the situation. It's helped by the fact that our system has made the world that much more tactile and the GM has built nuanced culture and relationships on both sides. Similarly, in another campaign, we were dropped into something like an alternate universe World War 1, shelled for 13 hours straight and then abandoned by command, even though we were told that our side was winning. In those situations, our thinking as players was about as good as our thinking as characters and in a certain sense contributed to character development even further. Because we run a lethal system, there is a risk of death or severe injury in most combats if we make a bad decision.<br/><br/>From a GM perspective, the way this works is that you create transposable encounters and set pieces as well as a few simple elements that you can combine to make encounters (e.g. enemies, environmental threats) for times where you're running on pure improv. It helps if you use rules that make it fast to construct a whole bunch of stuff. Basically, it seems that in the cases where I've really felt that I had to struggle as both a player and a character are the ones where the GM has abandoned plot and has instead engaged in an architecture of narrative - creating the space in which we collectively build the story. (Term borrowed from Henry Jenkins paper on the subject.)<br/><br/>So, uh, yeah. That's approx my thoughts on the subject.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358102/#Comment_358102" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T16:25:22+00:00" title="February  6, 2012  4:25PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 6, 2012 4:26PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Biggles, yeah, it's an interesting thing how that emerges, right?

Where 'right' is a very activity-dependent.  <br/><br/>Roleplaying may be unique in that the player and character's interests are often aligned to the extent that the player says "<i>I do this</i>" sometimes and "<i>my character does that</i>" at other times.  So the line between where the characters choices end and the players choices start is very blurry.  <br/><br/>But ultimately the designer is dictating the types of choices the player makes in his game, the character and when and why you roll dice etc... are just a means that end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biggles" title="biggles"><img alt="biggles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biggles">biggles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358144/#Comment_358144" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-07T02:44:45+00:00" title="February  7, 2012  2:44AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd suggest that there is an important difference between making a right decision in Guitar Hero and making one in Nethack. The ability to make big decisions is emphasised by Blizzard in many of their games - they want to make players feel powerful and increasingly so. They achieve this by continually increasing the player's range of positive options in any given situation. Farmville apparently uses a similar model. I would argue that struggle is defined by feeling unable to make big and game-changing decisions, but being forced to try by your beliefs or circumstances. It's not so much about the decisions themselves, but about how the decision making process plays out. In a complex struggle, the decision-making process will affect the players' (and their characters') goals and decisions. As I outlined in my post above, design can consist of specifying the space decisions play out in rather than the decisions themselves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358164/#Comment_358164" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-07T07:29:28+00:00" title="February  7, 2012  7:29AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite><b>The activity that's not a struggle</b><br/>[snippage]<br/>Now, suppose you think<i>most</i>roleplayers fall in this camp.

What you really need to give them is a top-notch process for creative collaboration that frames and surrounds everything, and then maybe a subsystem for character struggles within that. I think time has proven that stopping at "here's some inspiring setting content; one of you controls the world and the rest play characters; go!" does not qualify as "top notch".</blockquote>\nI think that a lot of times the type of play I enjoy falls into this category, and I agree that in terms of systems it's a bit under explored.<br/><br/>One thing that I think is helping me right now is understanding that I don't really consider this a game at all, and i'm coming to be really okay with that.<br/><br/>It's more like play pretend with a core idea for what we're doing together thrown in and explained/clarified, and the occasional odd-bit of game mechanic thrown in for seasoning.<br/><br/>I find it pretty damn fun actually.<br/><br/>I think we do see snippets of stuff (methods, approaches, mechanics) that do actually aid this kind of thing in other games, so it might be best simply to steal those ideas and mash them together. A good bit of stuff from Archipelago , for example, is emminently theft-worthy in that case. So are games that really re-examine what a GM even is exactly in context of that sort of play and how those kinds of duties associated with the Gm can be broken down and spread out.<br/><br/>Do <i>most</i> roleplayers fall into this category? Ooof! Tough call!<br/><br/>I do suspect a fairly large number of them do. Certainly it seems high among those I know personally, although it's always a bit dicey.I immediately think of the kinds of folks I've played with over the years who ate up fluff/setting, only vaguely understood any mechanics involved, and who were pretty trusting of the GM, but who also put in a fair bit of effort at the table "just playing" ( and often off the table,coming up with all sorts of odd/imteresting, no- during-session content).<br/><br/>I think a person could design to this mentality, or at least offer some kind of collected insight about it. What I doubt is that a person could make a sellable product geared towards an existing hobby market. ( I also doubt you could get it to reach a non-hobbyis- but-potentially-interested market, but for slightly different reasons...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358196/#Comment_358196" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-07T11:24:29+00:00" title="February  7, 2012 11:24AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2012 11:26AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve, agreed, meaningful decisions are key.  In a typical game, decisions are made meaningful by having a connection to the game's goal, with progress toward the goal being measurable and decisions affecting such measures.  When the game's goal is a clearly stated and measurable objective, this is relatively easy to understand and observe.  When the game's goal is less measurable and stated less clearly, though, connections and progress can be hard to spot.<br/><br/>Ask people about a decision to Go Aggro or not in Apocalypse World.  I suspect most people will tell you it feels meaningful.  Then ask them why.  They'll talk about the immediate fictional consequences.  But that's true whenever you make any binding die roll in any RPG.  Ask them to connect those consequences to the goal of the game.  I bet you'll get a variety of different opinions, and plenty of "I'm not sure"s.  Stick a bunch of thoughtful people in a room and I'm sure they could agree on some sort of answer, but that's quite different from apprehending it as you play.<br/><br/>In even the most aimless freeform game, at some level, there is something the participants hope to get out of it.  And if you can link their decisions into that, you can provide meaningful decisions.  At least, that's my conclusion.  <br/><br/>Whether the relationship between the decisions and the goal is a struggle or not, I would guess to be optional.  A decision that navigates between good and bad outcomes is obviously a struggle.  A decision that navigates between two good or two bad outcomes... well, maybe, maybe not.  A decision that navigates between awesome and even more awesome?  At that point, I ain't feelin' much struggle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358201/#Comment_358201" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-07T11:32:59+00:00" title="February  7, 2012 11:32AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            K-Bob,<br/><br/>Yeah, recognizing that it's not a proper game can save a lot of wasted design work.

Because the goals for some types of RPGs are hazy.  But nevertheless, people playing an enjoyable game will get satisfaction from making those decisions, whether it be from "and that changes everything" moments or "I see what you did there'  from the others at the table.<br/><br/>Supporting certain types of decisions is a clear design goal you can work towards.  Perhaps for an RPG that is enough of a game goal.  RPGs arent winnable are they? <br/><br/>I started a thread on different decisions a while ago, maybe its worth revisiting.

My closer-to-finished games have goals that are clear in my head but hard to articulate.  Take Delve, for instance:<br/><br/>Top level goal: Have fun with friends<br/>Within that: Have fun creatively collaborating with friends on a shared fiction<br/>Within that: <br/>1) Use your wits to maximize your team's rise from irrelevance/impotence/poverty to importance/power/wealth<br/>2) Experience the fiction as if you were really there<br/>3) Confront scary evil unknown monstrosities, face danger, learn magic secrets<br/><br/>So, to simplify, one could say that, for a player, the game goal is to improve your character's position in the world.  But that seems wrong to me.  Players can do that in a million games.  If they're picking up <i>my</i> game, it's because they want the combo of all 3.<br/><br/>The rules' intent is that (a) in order to play, you must do <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, and (b) in order to achieve <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, you must do <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>.  So <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> could be seen as givens, simply styles and methods of pursuing <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, which is the goal.  But I don't think it's that simple.  No matter how well I incentivize players to think in-character and go after monsters, they still have to bring the desire to do these things, and the will to put forth effort in that direction.  In a medium as complicated as group ad-libbed fiction, no game incentives are ever going to do by themselves what they can do in the hands of players who share their goal.<br/><br/>In fact, I'd say that if a player enjoys all 3, it doesn't even matter which one is <i>most</i> important to them.  If their <i>main</i> goal in sitting down to play Delve is to face and learn about evil magical weirdness from character POV, then great.  Maybe that's a goal <i>about</i> the game rather than <i>within</i> the game, and maybe that distinction matters... I'm not really sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358307/#Comment_358307" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-08T07:14:00+00:00" title="February  8, 2012  7:14AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>K-Bob,<br/><br/>Yeah, recognizing that it's not a proper game can save a lot of wasted design work.
