There's a fine line between a challenge and a nuisance..."<br/><br/>1. Not to be killed without warning<br/>2. Not to be given horribly unclear hints<br/>3. To be able to win without experience of past lives<br/>4. To be able to win without knowledge of future events<br/>5. Not to have the game closed off without warning<br/>6. Not to need to do unlikely things<br/>7. Not to need to do boring things for the sake of it<br/>8. Not to have to type exactly the right verb<br/>9. To be allowed reasonable synonyms<br/>10. To have a decent parser<br/>11. To have reasonable freedom of action<br/>12. Not to depend much on luck<br/>13. To be able to understand a problem once it is solved<br/>14. Not to be given too many red herrings<br/>15. To have a good reason why something is impossible<br/>16. Not to need to be American<br/>17. To know how the game is getting on<br/><br/>These sound like good tips for old-school GMing with fiction-based challenges.  For my own game in that category, I use 1, 2, 6, 7, 14 and 15 almost exactly as written, have my own tabletop equivalent of 8/9, always support 11 as best I can, give feedback which sorta covers 17, and attempt to provide for 13.  3-5, 10, and 16 don't come up as far as I'm aware.  So, trim that list accordingly, and you've got a good starting point.<br/><br/>Or, y'know, play some more constrained RPG where the rules and GM role kinda cover it, and then you don't need much beyond:<br/><br/>1.

Actually I can't think of a single item that applies to all styles.<br/>Like, I very much like the following for D&amp;D:<br/>1. The DM should first and foremost consult the prep. What's in that mage's pockets? Does the prep say anything?<br/>2. Failing that, the DM should consult mechanics. For example random tables of weird pocket stuff.<br/>3. And only as a last resort, make something up that seems fitting. Like deciding that her pockets are empty or have a couple of copper pieces.<br/><br/>Now, it's strange, but I'm kinda happy with this priority for many games -- but while I care very much about it, at the same time I think different games have a completely different weight to the priorities. Like in D&amp;D I try to have as much prep as possible, and as a fallback have random tables to cover most eventualities, and only as a last resort make something up (which I gladly do, if it gets to it, I like improvising, but it's a sign that the prep was insufficient, in this mode of play) -- but in other games, maybe the order is the same but falling down on it us done much more eagerly and the amount of prep and mechanics is way smaller. You'd make a front and a namelist at most, it'd almost be taboo to prep more.<br/><br/>And, in some games, like Archipelago, this list is completely unappropriate.<br/><br/>But OK. After writing all of that, I came up with something that I feel strongly about, that's often broken, and that's common to many playstyles.<br/>1. Dice shall be rolled openly and monster AC and HP shall be known<br/>2. DM should be expected to follow the rules if the players are. For example, in AW the Principles are rules rather than advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453807/#Comment_453807" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-11T19:11:55+00:00" title="June 11, 2016  7:11PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those who have long too successfully laboured to inflame players of RPGs by gross misrepresentations, and to infuse into their minds a system of opinions, repugnant to the true constitution of the game group, and to their subordinate relation to the Game-Master, now openly avow their revolt, hostility and rebellion. Many unhappy players may still retain their loyalty, and may be too wise not to see the fatal consequence of this usurpation, and wish to resist it, yet the torrent of weird theories and stupid advice has been strong enough to compel their acquiescence, till a sufficient force shall appear to support them.<br/><br/>On our part, though it was declared in 2003 that a rebellion existed, yet even those players we wished rather to reclaim than to subdue. The online discussions breathed a spirit of moderation and forbearance; conciliatory propositions accompanied the measures taken to enforce authority; and the coercive acts were adapted to cases of conspiratorial combinations amongst players not then in arms. I have acted with the same temper; anxious to prevent, if it had been possible, the calamities which are inseparable from a state of war; still hoping that my RPG players would have discerned the traitorous views of their leaders, and have been convinced, that to be a subject of a Game-Master, with all its consequences, is to be the freest member of any civil society in the known world.<br/><br/>The rebellious war now levied is become more general, and is manifestly carried on for the purpose of establishing an independent empire. I need not dwell upon the fatal effects of the success of such a plan. The object is too important, the spirit of RPGs too high, the resources with which God hath blessed us too numerous, to give up so many players which she has planted with great industry, nursed with great tenderness, encouraged with many commercial advantages, and protected and defended at much expence of blood and treasure.<br/><br/>It is now become the part of wisdom, and (in its effects) of clemency, to put a speedy end to these disorders by the most decisive exertions. <br/><br/>When the unhappy and deluded multitude, against whom this force will be directed, shall become sensible of their error, I shall be ready to receive the misled with tenderness and mercy ! and in order to prevent the inconveniencies which may arise from the great distance of their situation, and to remove as soon as possible the calamities which they suffer, I shall give authority to certain persons upon the spot to grant general or particular pardons and indemnities, in such manner, and to such persons as they shall think fit; and to receive the submission of any RPG player who shall be disposed to return to their allegiance. It may be also proper to authorise the persons so commissioned to restore such RPG player so returning to its allegiance, to the free exercise of their play and commerce, and to the same protection and security as if they had never revolted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453812/#Comment_453812" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-12T12:09:15+00:00" title="June 12, 2016 12:09PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2016 12:09PM by Rickard.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are some guidelines from Viola Spolin.

You phrased it in a way so that I can find words. So again, thank you WM.<br/><br/>I love some games where neither the players nor the DM have <i>any idea</i> when death -- even permanent PC death -- is going to strike. In fact, I see that as a huge plus with some game styles.<br/><br/>In the case of jumping through a fire. I think the DM should tell the players the chance of death. "You'll have about a 20% chance of dying" (or whatever the chance is, if it's easy enough to calculate, some games like Jason Morningstar's excellent <i>Fight Fire</i> have fires that consists of so many factors and dice rolls and points and aspects that it's not easy to calculate). I mean, I think it's polite to do so. But I don't think it's a strong enough requirement that it belongs in an inalienable list of rights.<br/><br/>It's a politeness at best, absolutely never a necessity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454059/#Comment_454059" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-22T17:39:42+00:00" title="June 22, 2016  5:39PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's ok to disagree, but I'd need to know on what you disagree. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Rob</blockquote>\nI missed this post earlier.

But then also, I'll admit to you that I'm talking here of a game style I believe you don't like too much, which is probably more like wuxia in the sense that characters are expected to jump right into a big group of minions and kick them all unconscious, or an old-comic book style where villains may leave heroes unconscious but never kill them. <br/><br/>There are so much people used to this kind of playstyle that I often have to make sure all players and the GM are on the same page about character death, because the references they may have for each genre are so varied that even when saying "medieval fantasy" it's different to say "old school", "tolkien-like", "Game of Thrones-like" or "historical accurate" death.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454069/#Comment_454069" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-22T18:19:36+00:00" title="June 22, 2016  6:19PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 22, 2016 6:21PM by 2097.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>A game where the entirety of the rules are not known.</blockquote>\nWe just wrapped up a long Pandemic Legacy campaign.

To have campaigns not suddenly end, that's... that's what games often do: "Art is never finished, only abandoned" as DaVinci put it.<br/><br/>To me this project is so far progressing like "Let's make an unalienable list of Important Things that All Players Always Need For All Games!"<br/>An it starts with like "OK, players must have at least 12 AC at starting level! In every RPG!"<br/>"Players must start with a full hand of cards in every RPG" "Players can not be asked to spend more than one fate point per 15-minute period in every RPG".<br/>It's like... guys, we're doing art here. You'll end up like Doesburg and Mondrian, cutting friendship because Doesburg committed the dual sins of using diagonals (the horror) and algorithmic composition (OK, that's more understandably contrary to Mondrian's aims).<br/><br/>Having a campaign specific list of rights that players can rely on against DMs is great and I can see something like:<br/>"Players have the right to have their character's lives be in real danger of death"<br/>"Players have the right that the DM shall never fudge"<br/>"Players should be given real choices"<br/>"DM shall follow the rules and not refer to Rule Zero"<br/>etc for a game of some types that I'd like to play in. That's a list I would gladly undersign and present to the DM. So far we're getting: <br/>A. Items that are kind of opposite of campaign-specific list; in that they replace danger and excitement with inevitability and dramatic structure<br/>B. Claims of universality (the Berg principle isn't nearly enough of a caveat) that go way beyond such a campaign-specific list.<br/><br/>Actually what I would want most of all would be a bill that was one sentence:<br/>"The table shall Play to Find Out."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi" title="rgrassi"><img alt="rgrassi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi">rgrassi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454108/#Comment_454108" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-23T12:04:18+00:00" title="June 23, 2016 12:04PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sandra, this:<br/><br/>"Playing arc (intended as the complete expected duration of an rpg game) should not be terminated suddenly without warning."<br/><br/>is just a formal way to say this.<br/><br/><i>(A group of people is having fun together...)</i><br/>"Great, come on!

It could be a great way to help everyone get on the same page, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454121/#Comment_454121" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-23T17:26:35+00:00" title="June 23, 2016  5:26PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2016 6:53PM by 2097.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It says <i>should not</i> happen. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Sudden ending may be funny sometimes but is it funny doing it "all the time"? :O<br/>Rob<br/></blockquote>\nWe do it several times per week.

Random death and random end to play are indeed things that can severely displease gamers.<br/><br/>I think points 3 and 4 from Nelson apply best to learning-demanding encounters in RPGs -- the monster you can't beat until you learn its weakness, but by the time you learn its weakness you're so low on HP that you're toast.  I assume Nelson's point is that it's a friggin' chore to start the game over from scratch (or from a distant save point) to repeat an encounter just because there was no possible way you were going to beat it the first time.  Personally, I think this is more a matter of degree than a hard line, but I think Nelson has a point -- I might phrase it as something like "players have a right not to have to <i>grind</i> in order to get anywhere", in the un-fun drudgery sense of "grind".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454127">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi" title="rgrassi"><img alt="rgrassi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rgrassi">rgrassi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454127/#Comment_454127" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-23T20:39:31+00:00" title="June 23, 2016  8:39PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2016 8:50PM by rgrassi.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/search?Search=%232097&amp;Mode=like">#2097</a>, one question.\n<blockquote>In our most recent game (monday three nights ago) literally right after a roll, someone said "Ok let's wrap it up" and the rest of us looked at our watches and said "Yes"</blockquote>\nBut will you continue that game in the next days?<br/>Because that's different from a "playing arc".<br/>A stop during play, for whatever reason, is absolutely good.<br/>What I'm talking here is to end suddenly a "complete game" without warning for players.<br/><br/>Such as you're playing at Cold Soldier and during the first Mission.<br/>"Ok.

That includes reminding or overriding the GM if necessary.  I also think, in the case where a group is playing a game that they don't yet know inside and out, a good Rights list defines the limit beyond which the group will cease to obey the rulebook or module.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454181/#Comment_454181" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-24T20:28:35+00:00" title="June 24, 2016  8:28PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2016 8:29PM by WarriorMonk.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Then the Bill of Player rights should actually be a checklist like the one Sandra wrote before in the thread, so every player can check what they want in their own checklist and then they make a unified one based on everyone's choices, discussing whatever item they didn't agreed on.

Of course, a game can always end if key people decide they don't want to play anymore. However, in some games character death could keep someone from playing *while they still want to* (and possibly while everyone else wants them to, as well), and that's something completely different, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Given a specific case like character death, we could formulate the right thus:<br/><br/>* If my character dies, I have the right to continue to be included in the game (e.g. rolling up a new character, becoming co-gm, etc).<br/><br/>It would be pretty rare (but not completely unthinkable!) for a GM to be sidelined in some fashion, as well. We once started playing before the GM showed up, and had a really fun session (it turned into something like a mini-LARP). I could imagine a group doing something like that and not allowing the GM to join in even if they did arrive. (I've seen groups take a whole session to carry out prep or planning for the next stage of the campaign, which could exclude the GM for hours on end, as well.)                        </div>\n<div

However, I feel that a much more fundamental right/duty would be:<br/><br/>* Each player (GM included) clearly knows what is expected of them: how long the game will be, how often they will meet, and what their responsibilities are during that time.<br/><br/>For instance, if I'm invited to play with some folks on Tuesday night, and I go, and have a good time... but then I find out that they've just been assuming that I would be able to come back every week and they've been prepping a campaign which would take two years to play out, and involves my character in an important role (e.g. the Chosen One of the campaign!), there's been a serious miscommunication.<br/><br/>Same goes - for instance - for knowing rules and/or bringing resources with you. Is a player holding up the game if he doesn't know the rules for his character's abilities, doesn't own his own dice, or didn't bring a rulebook describing his chosen feats/spells? What if he forgets his character sheet each week?<br/><br/>Will the players feel let down or misled if the GM shows up with nothing prepared for the session?<br/><br/>So that's just one example. The Rights so far are good, but only dealing with a narrow slice of what roleplaying is, I feel.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt

Not sure how useful that is to us, exactly.<br/><br/>I can think of a million things (like failing to communicate the length of a campaign, playing a game while using a module like Tomb of Terrors and trying to be a brutal and impartial referee, trying to screw over others while playing Paranoia, etc) which would never come to mind for a typical person when they think of the word "kindness". When I'm playing a game and it asks me how many tokens I want to bid in order to screw over my opponent so I can win the Objective by crippling his ability to keep defending himself, I don't think "kindness" is a natural place for the human brain to go.<br/><br/>If you're making a larger point - that all roleplaying is a social endeavour, and we do best at it when we are kind and respectful to each other - then of course you are spot-on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455296/#Comment_455296" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-26T18:39:45+00:00" title="July 26, 2016  6:39PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think any of these rules would produce a game I want to play in or run. To me, this seems like coming up with a list of 'rights' that is really just about enforcing a particular play style. Nothing wrong with having a play style and preferring it over others, but framing it as a moral issue of rights? For a lot of people the fact that characters can die without warning is what makes play exciting. For a lot of us, having a guaranteed story arch is the last thing we want (to me that just feels artificial). If it is possible for my character to die without warning, that isn't a violation of my rights as a player, that is my taste being catered to.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455308/#Comment_455308" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-26T20:31:28+00:00" title="July 26, 2016  8:31PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of course being mean in Paranoia is kindness!

I will typically explain this to players in my games, but when I am a player, and new to a group or GM, I generally respect whatever approach they take and don't get worked up if they do things differently. Something about framing this as a 'players rights' issue, just doesn't seem like a solid place to start from. If it is an issue of setting expectations, then it is a setting up expectations list. Otherwise,again it feels like a way of creating an 'ought' in discussion around play styles (i.e. the GM is morally bad for killing my character suddenly with no warning).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455324/#Comment_455324" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-27T02:05:33+00:00" title="July 27, 2016  2:05AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>(i.e. the GM is morally bad for killing my character suddenly with no warning). </blockquote>\nWell, I certainly don't like that, either. Frame that as a moral right and not only are you clueless, but you've just discredited a huge proportion of really fun gaming (as well as a good deal of its history).
