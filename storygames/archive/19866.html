I always bring something to the holidays to play with the family and this is this years game. Not sure if it's up to the genius of Lasers and Feelings, but I thought I'd share it for anyone who remembers Battle Born fondly.<br/><br/>Elevator Pitch<br/><br/>You are one of the few remaining immunes (from the Pacification Virus) and belong to the misfit Squad 76, known as the \u201cSpirit of Baltimore\u201d (of 100 squads with <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> being the best and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23100&amp;Mode=like">#100</a> the worst). Battle Born, part of the League\u2019s Military Assault and Combat Expedition (MACE) or as the troopers say, \u201cMost Anyone Conscious and Expendable,\u201d are equipped with an overly-complicated, mech-style battle suit. In a poker game, Sarge managed to win a Resolution Class dispatch ship, the Dauntless Perisher. Your job is to carry out the League\u2019s orders to the best of your ability (command\u2019s expectations are very low, very very low) while keeping the pacified and unarmored (affectionately known as squishies) safe (usually from your malfunctioning EE suit or poorly aimed kinetic shells).<br/><br/>How will you complete your orders?<br/><br/> Download: <a href="http://www.emptygamebox.com/empty/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/QuickandDirtyBattleBorn.pdf" rel="nofollow">Quick and Dirty Battle Born</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ArtPatient" title="ArtPatient"><img alt="ArtPatient" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ArtPatient">ArtPatient</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440125/#Comment_440125" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-15T14:59:26+00:00" title="November 15, 2014  2:59PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lots of good stuff.<br/><br/>In the G/Sol issue of Space Gamer, the Overkill results are usually (very) bad, so it's interesting that you turned it on its head for this game.<br/><br/>Of course, that's seemingly replaced by the dice bonuses (+2d if it\u2019s really stupid, etc.) which matches the original intent but gets there differently.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440169/#Comment_440169" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-17T05:00:07+00:00" title="November 17, 2014  5:00AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I originally wrote Overkill as a bad result, but it just felt wrong in the mashup. The questioning is central to L&amp;F, so I used that as Overkill. I always felt like Battle Born "trusted" the players to play their characters according to the setting, instead of rewarding play according to the setting, so it just felt right changing the Ignobles (Goals) and adding the dice bonuses for playing to the theme.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
