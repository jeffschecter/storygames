Braving many dangers along the way, to recover scrolls of Buddhist scripture, that are missing from the Chinese canon.The road through the wilderness is dangerous since all of Demon-kind has resolved to stop the pilgrims and the eat the Monk's flesh!<br/><br/>The game's simple rules, which use standard playing cards, allow for any sort of action that you can imagine, from fast paced kung-fu to heated debates.   <br/><br/>The main rule book contains all that you need to play, except two packs of standard playing cards (one for the players and one for the referee) and your imagination.<br/><br/>The kickstarter is to pay for the new art that the book(s) require, since the first edition was completely made up from clip art except the cover (which is also being redone), and the development costs for the new and expanded text.<br/><br/>At time of writing, a week on from its initial launch, the main rule book has been funded , along with two first two stretch goals. These were:  <b>If you see Buddha on the Road</b> an additional adventure in the main book, which will be the basis of a Quick Start Book as well, and an additional chapter called <b>Defenders of the Dragon Empire</b> detailing how to create and use mortal wuxia heroes with the game.  <br/><br/>Currently we are funding the next two stretch goals: The <b>Ministry of Thunder</b> a book of five linked adventures, involving the celestial of the title whose agents hunt down supernatural criminals on Earth, and the <b>Monkey Companion</b> a collection of short adventures and articles that expand the game further.  <br/><br/><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/645319106/monkey-the-roleplaying-game-of-the-journey-to-the" rel="nofollow">Monkey the roleplaying game of the Journey to the West on Kickstarter.com</a><br/><br/>More information about the game, rules previews, art examples can be found on the Monkey Blog as part of a series of posts called "23 Days of Monkey" that I posted in the run up to the Kickstarter opening: <br/><br/><a href="http://monkey.d101games.com/tag/23-days-of-monkey/" rel="nofollow">23 Days of Monkey, previews, rules explanations and art examples and loads of Monkey fun!<br/></a><br/>I did an interview with the marvellous Dan Davenport of RPG.net Chat, who is adept at pulling out what a game is about via his interviews.  <br/><br/><a href="https://gmshoe.wordpress.com/2017/01/17/qa-newt-newport-monkey-the-roleplaying-game-of-the-journey-to-the-west/" rel="nofollow">[Q&amp;A] Newt Newport (Monkey, the Roleplaying Game of the Journey to the West)</a><br/><br/>If you have any questions please feel free to ask.<br/><br/>;O) Newt<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/015/075/305/7c52ea161e78b0953750871f18bafdf6_original.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576&amp;fit=fill&amp;bg=000000&amp;v=1484827384&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=808badd826b369b801e41b0be28fc4bb"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459432/#Comment_459432" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-19T23:04:44+00:00" title="January 19, 2017 11:04PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm excited about the topic, but worried that the game makes use of "adventures" as a unit of content (which suggests something not quite to my tastes).

Most of them have come across the story quickly via one of the films or TV series.  So I've included a couple of quick one session scripted adventures  in the main rulebook to help get people started. <br/><br/>How I approach adventures is dealt with in this post, along with how the players can grab narrative control.<br/><br/><a href="http://monkey.d101games.com/2017/01/05/23-days-of-monkey-day-20-journeying-west/" rel="nofollow">23 Days of Monkey, Day 20 Journeying West</a><br/><br/>Hope that helps.<br/><br/>;o) Newt<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
