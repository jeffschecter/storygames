A few tweaks and it could handle most genres. If anything it might have played a little too fast, feeling like there's not enough game there, if that makes sense. <br/><br/>Nameless Streets was a great supplement, and I consider the author a friend, but the book really only added a few pertinent rules and an interesting setting. That doesn't speak ill of the writer or the supplement, rather it speaks well of Laws' original. HeroQuest 2 is generic and sleek enough to handle most genres out of the box.<br/><br/>So again, for HeroQuest 2 fans, what kind of tweaks would you like to see for a supers supplement and what kind of setting would you like to see to make it worth the price of admission?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PencilBoy99" title="PencilBoy99"><img alt="PencilBoy99" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PencilBoy99">PencilBoy99</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450991/#Comment_450991" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-30T22:26:54+00:00" title="January 30, 2016 10:26PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm... I agree w/ you that the big issue w/ HeroQuest II is it does seem to play sort of unsatisfactorily fast. Whether or not I like it, having mechanics that consume a bit of time and involve some strategy make things seem more satisfying. It's certainly possible, right - Heroquest Glorantha offers additional combat options.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451343/#Comment_451343" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-14T21:12:21+00:00" title="February 14, 2016  9:12PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            HeroQuest 2 removed some of the 'special rules' that crept into HeroQuest from Hero Wars. The principle was that the core mechanic for conflict resolution: ability + augment + situational modifiers (inc. broad/stretch) vs. resistance should be able to handle all conflicts. After all its not task based resolution.<br/><br/>The exception is an extended contest, which essentially decomposes the conflict resolution into task resolution. This adds some options such as resolution points, assists, etc. that become important when you decompose the conflict.<br/><br/>So I would be cautious on adding special rules, but if you had to reserve them for extended contest options that reflected your genre better.<br/><br/>Robin Laws gives some great advice in the section at the back of the book on how to handle ideas like powers, and it would have been great to see more people build HQ2 genre packs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper" title="Ian Cooper"><img alt="Ian Cooper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/733/nRK18K7505XHK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ian%20Cooper">Ian Cooper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451344/#Comment_451344" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-02-14T21:13:08+00:00" title="February 14, 2016  9:13PM">February 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PS I like Nameless Streets as it was one of the few attempts to do a genre book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
