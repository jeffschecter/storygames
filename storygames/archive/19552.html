I've previously had a hard time with setting-dense games and rules systems that don't provide a kind of explicit direction for gameplay (e.g. Burning Wheel). However, I've had some practice with games like The Clay That Woke, and I think a one-on-one game will keep the game focused and we can chase what the player is interested in without getting overwhelmed.<br/><br/>I wanted to set the game in Pavis since that's one of the classic Glorantha campaign spots, and I've gotten my mitts on a lot of the old Glorantha materials. The primary books I've been using so far have been Pavis &amp; Big Rubble, Pavis: Gateway to Adventure, Cults of Prax, and Cults of Terror. After character creation Carly decided to play a citizen of the Lunar Empire so I've also been using Lunar Imperial Handbooks one and two since I don't know much about the Lunar Empire.<br/><br/>The game so far has mostly just been me heaving out setting details to see what grabs her. Pavis is an extremely well-fleshed out setting, and the characters and cultures of Glorantha have all kinds of built-in conflicts. Her character is from a land conquered by an expanding empire and a convert to the empire's religion and a loyal subject. The character is also a scholar trying to unearth the history of Pavis. She also has two NPC followers that can generate conflicts too - a local who's a member of a death cult who's her PC's bodyguard and a trollkin (a small, not very smart relative of trolls) who acts as her PC's servant.<br/><br/>Here's what I generated for the first session:<br/><br/>- Carly decided her character was from Tarsh, an ally and province of the Lunar Empire far from Pavis, and a follower of the Lunar religion. Tarsh has traditionally followed a different pantheon of gods, and one of the relationships the HeroQuest rules gave her was a relationship to her ancestors. I decided her ancestors are upset that she's turned her back on her old religion and left her homeland, so she's been having dreams where they harass her. There's also a god in the setting called Daka Fal who is responsible for sending the dead to the appropriate afterlife, and I came up with this idea while concurrently thinking about ways to introduce members of his cult.<br/><br/>- I also looked at the Pavis encounters tables and came up with Adventurer and Townsfolk. I used the character creation rules (as inspiration, I didn't fully generate a character) to come up with an ex cavalryman Dara Happan for her to encounter. The townsfolk was just a generic mob of people that lived in the ruins of Old Pavis, that I turned into looters when she encountered them after a failed dice roll. They were still townsfolk, but they were in the process of plundering some ruins she had hoped to find some artifacts in.<br/><br/>- I dropped a tip to one of the predesigned adventures in one of the books. Most of the adventure didn't really apply to her, but the last part involving some trolls who had stolen a precious artifact was easily adapted and her character overheard it.<br/><br/>- Like a lot of old supplements, the book has a section full of rumors. I planted one, that the Pavis constable is looking the other way regarding anti-imperial meetings, as a way to set up some problems in the future. Probably a violent encounter with some anti-imperials!<br/><br/>- I looked at her character's profession, Scholar, and what I know she wanted to do (dig up old Pavis artifacts) and came up with a story about how the descendant of a historical figure fled into some ruins with an artifact fleeing the Lunar empire's takeover.<br/><br/>- I looked at locations in Pavis she might want to visit. There's a location listed in the sourcebooks - a magical art gallery that will occasionally spontaneously spawn artwork. Perfect!<br/><br/>- Every campaign needs a villain. I dipped into Cults of Terror and dreamed up a scorpion man with two heads who is a champion of Primal Chaos and commands these acidic slime creatures (called gorp). He doesn't really have an agenda, he's just a terrifying predator in the ruins that she'll hear about and one day encounter. I named him... SLIME SKIN.<br/><br/>- Finally, since religion and heroquesting is so important to Glorantha, I wanted to introduce a myth related to her character's religion and a possible heroquest. Her character is a member of the Cerisian church, which we've decided is a kind of fringe Lunar religion. It's technically legit and thought of as harmless, but a little weird. There is a very small church of Cerisians in Pavis for her to join up in, and I'm thinking that helping them and maybe bringing more people into the fold could be a campaign goal. She specifically follows a saint of this church, Saint Henshelek, who was an accountant turned wanderer and scholar who traveled Glorantha cataloging its wonders. So I made up a story about some faraway Lunar colony that was barely surviving and struggling to farm. Saint Henshelek went into the wilderness and spent time with the indigenous people and learned their ways, and returned and taught their farming methods and the crops they grow to the settlers. That's the full story, the myth version is that he went into the woods and came back with some magic seeds. But anyway, the churchgoers in Pavis are having the same problem and want her character to go on a heroquest to accomplish the same goal! This is waiting for her character the next time she attends church services.<br/><br/>We've played one session and so far so good. She's bumped into a lot of this stuff and is enthusiastic about the details of the setting. Maybe even more than I am! I kept wanting to jump into conflicts and she wanted to know what food the local taverns were serving! I've mostly been able to rely on my prep, though I had to improvise some stuff. For instance she dug up an old map of Pavis and asked about some possible locations (a library and university) that she wanted to fine. I said sure, but I don't know anything about them. The magic paintings in the art gallery were about Saint Henshelek which I'd planned but I didn't plan what was on the paintings. Whoops! I threw out a couple myths we knew (his enlightenment, the myth I said above about the seeds) and then improvised a painting where he had his hand on the head of a weeping man wearing human bones. I have no idea what that's about!<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to the next session. She wants to find an intact building in the ruins to study it and learn about the ways of the people who used to live there, so I'm thinking of some interesting things she could find there (a toy for sure, not sure what else). I also looked at the random encounters table for something else she might encounter. Bandits! Her bodyguard has magic that lets her detect ambushes though, so they'll know that a trap has been set outside. Her PC will just have to find a way around or through it.<br/><br/>Sorry about the wall of text. I figure if anyone's interested we can talk about and if not it will just fade away. I'm just excited about the game and wanted to talk about it and the way I'm prepping to handle a dense setting. If it seems like I put a lot of time into it, it's because I did! But that's just because I had two weeks between character creation and our first session. I don't think I can keep this up at this level! But that's fine - she'll focus in on those things and I can backburner the rest.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434622/#Comment_434622" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-30T13:10:43+00:00" title="June 30, 2014  1:10PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm curious about how to make one-on-one gaming work, so consider me interested.<br/><br/>Do you miss the party interaction?

So I wouldn't say we miss the party interaction. It's like sometimes we want to eat dinner with friends and sometimes we want to just be the two of us, and playing RPGs is the same way. If you mean has not having a party been an obstacle? Not really. HeroQuest 1st ed. in particular has some good rules for surrounding PCs with followers and other friendly NPCs to help them. Also, not to toot my own horn, but I've been told before I'm really good at playing a diverse cast of NPCs so I think that helps.<br/><br/>The first session was about three hours, but there's also a lot of playing when we're not officially playing. One night as we were falling asleep she was asking me a bunch of questions about Pavis and we talked about the setting and her character and fleshed out some details.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434624/#Comment_434624" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-30T13:24:39+00:00" title="June 30, 2014  1:24PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2014 2:27AM by AsIf.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some of my best games <i>EVAR</i>  have been one-on-one games.

And what don't cha?</blockquote>\nSo here's why I picked it for this game, and a lot of the "what I like" is in here.<br/><br/><br/>- Character creation informs you about your character and gives you material to work with. Kind of like Burning Wheel's Lifepaths, by the time you've picked your occupation, culture, and religion you're going to have a mess of abilities, personality traits, relationships, etc. that help dig you into the setting. Carly's character is a scholar from Tarsh who worships Saint Henshelek. While she originally imagined her character as a robed nerd, it turns out that if you live in Tarsh you know how to kill people with an axe. That's just who they are, and she was really excited about having her character surprise her like that. Also with a vast setting like Glorantha, it's helpful that character creation weaves the characters into it.<br/><br/>- You can play a huge variety of Gloranthan characters out of the book. A lot of the more recent Glorantha rulebooks focus on playing Heortlings, and since I wanted to set the game in one of the classic settings, Pavis, which is a city with adventurers and settlers journeying to it from all over, it was important to me that there was a choice there and other things to play. And also that those choices were written into the rules in a way where we wouldn't have to improvise them. You pick where you come from, you get skills and personality traits that tell you about that place. But there's also the flexibility to improvise if you have to! There's not enough machinery in the rules that if I had to improvise a culture whole cloth I couldn't.<br/><br/>- Anything is a character ability! I think this is really neat. When it comes time to roll dice for a conflict you could roll your Spear-Fighting ability of 17, or you could have a magical spear called Impaler with a rating of 17, or you could have a personality trait of Bloodthirsty at 17. Or you could have a bodyguard who's a spearfighter at 17 to fight for you. Mechanically they're all the same but they add a different flavor to the conflict and let the player tell you what matters to them about their character.<br/><br/>- Relationships are represented in a mechanically similar way, which is very simple and important to us in particular since Carly loves LOVES developing her PC's relationships with NPCs in games. Having that represented on her sheet, letting her dump points into improving her relationships with NPCs, letting her have a hand in developing who the NPCs are and what they can do seemed like something we would both enjoy. And so far it is - her death-worshipping bodyguard has resolved a lot of conflicts.<br/><br/>- Organic-ish character development. I love systems where what the character uses becomes who they are. I'm citing Burning Wheel again, but we once played a game where her character was a reclusive hunter. Her social skills were TERRIBLE but Carly was always angling for social conflicts and over time her character became amazingly persuasive. HeroQuest doesn't quite have that, which is a bummer, but it does have two levels at which you advance your abilities. If you used something during a session or it was relevant in some way, you improve it at a cheaper cost than something you didn't. So even if you spent the session sipping tea and discussing politics, you can still raise your Combat Wizardry, it just costs more than if you raised your Tea Sipping.<br/><br/>- Theoretically infinite character abilities. In a game of mythic heroes and gods, this is one of my favorite bits. There is technically no limit to how high your abilities can get. Like, it doesn't matter how difficult it is for one person to defeat an army by themselves, if you raise your combat ability high enough you can do it. Combine that with the fact that there's a sort of maximum penalty that your dice rolls can take, you can achieve this level of mythic/weird that really fits with the way Glorantha is entrenched in myth and storytelling. You could sink all your points into your Eating skill and eventually it doesn't matter how much of a penalty you have to your roll to eat a Troll, you're that epic and amazing and legendary that you can do it! (This last bit people might not agree with but that's MY take on the rules)<br/><br/>- Conflicts are easy and one roll and there's not extensive combat rules that I have to throw out in order to keep character mortality from being a huge looming danger. You can do extended conflicts like in The Shadow of Yesterday if you want more drama, but I mostly just stick with simple one-roll stuff.<br/><br/>- The rules provide a structure for heroquesting (a form of extradimensional dream questing where you can reenact the stories of gods and heroes to change reality) which is pretty core to the setting but poorly explained in a lot of the other Glorantha systems. This would be easy enough to graft on another system but I give it bonus points for this.<br/><br/>- It has three different character creation methods to pick from! Narrative where you write a story and pull scores out of key concepts, list method which is more the 'traditional' character creation setup, and as-you-go which I wish more games have. We used a combo of list and as-you-go, which gave us a good starting point but will let Carly add things as her understanding of her character changes in play.<br/><br/>Things I don't like:<br/><br/>- Some of the character creation stuff, particularly when it comes to religion, isn't super clear from the rules. So textual clarity as a whole.<br/><br/>- I'm not a big fan of the extended conflict stuff. Overly complicated involving bidding points and rolling over and over. Easy to ignore.<br/><br/>- Early Glorantha rules systems had more organic character development - use skills, increase them. I wish it had that! But that's not a big deal either.<br/><br/>- The cover turns off everyone I've ever shown it to. It looks like a football fan fighting a yoga instructor.<br/><br/>I'll probably remember more stuff later. But that's a good start right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434789/#Comment_434789" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-03T11:26:21+00:00" title="July  3, 2014 11:26AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steven" title="Steven"><img alt="Steven" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://sjhhanlon.wordpress.com/files/2007/10/tinyphoto.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steven">Steven</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434843/#Comment_434843" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-04T14:09:41+00:00" title="July  4, 2014  2:09PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it fair to assume that you're using 1ed Heroquest because you prefer it to 2nd?

Garrath found a more intact house in Pavis and explored it, checking out the frescoes and the architecture and trying to figure out how the people of Pavis lived. I ask Carly for a lot of this information because she knows about it more than I do, so often I'll describe a scene and then we kind of retcon it as she clarifies some things and tells me about different historical architecture styles and why they did certain things.<br/><br/>That night Garrath was haunted by his ancestors who shouted at him with voices like howling winds about how he abandoned his homeland and religion, and the howling alerted some bandits to their location. They did some parkour, jumping from building to building to escape them (though they had to throw Gnorrash to each other, he was too short/afraid to jump). Then they made it to the Real City, which is Jokata's home. They paid their respects at the temple of Pavis and Garrath asked around for information about some of the artifacts he was looking for, finding out that the chalice is rumored to be in a nest of scorpion men. That sounds a little out of Garrath's league at the moment, though, so he's going to move on to Mani's Fort before returning back to New Pavis for the weekly services at his church. We ended there!<br/><br/>I'm thinking sometime soon that he's going to be approached by a heroquester of Daka Fal (a sort of psychopomp of the native Praxians) who want him to take on the role of the Haunted Man in their quest. They'll offer to placate his ancestors and then maybe try to get him to join them to accomplish some other tasks. I need to think about what the myth is and what it involves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435547/#Comment_435547" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-21T08:36:56+00:00" title="July 21, 2014  8:36AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last night Garrath ran into a Lunar patrol. He had thought of journeying into Mani's Fort, but the Lunar patrol was headed back to the gate so rather than risk more journeying through Big Rubble alone he traveled with them. They walked and talked and he became friendly with the patrol leader, Amena. <br/><br/>When he got back he shared his findings in Rubble with his patron Manalaketh. Manalaketh's daughter has been afraid of Garrath during his visits, so Garrath decided to craft a doll based on one of the ones he found in the Rubble. Carly got way into this conflict and spent two Hero Points to make it a perfect recreation of the doll as it existed in the days of Old Pavis. This was a pretty big deal, and one of the neat things about HeroQuest is that you can do "as above, so below" stuff and make the followers of gods follow in the footsteps those gods. But since the myths of the game are sketchily written you can also take things the PCs did and then come up with god myths based on them kind or retroactively. So there might be a "Henshelek teaches the children" myth incoming. Since Carly spent two Hero Points on it, it's a big deal and it's flagging her relationship with the girl and the stuff surrounding it as significant.<br/><br/>After that he traveled to his church for services and for advice on being haunted by ghosts. The liturgist told him that the ghosts were manifestations of Sedenya (the Red Goddess that Garrath and his church worships) and that they are lesson for him. Something to be learned from, not driven away. The farmers of his church than asked him if he could go on the heroquest of Henshelek finds the Seeds, and he agreed to though he is going to need time for planning on research.<br/><br/>As he headed back into New Pavis from his church, he was approached by three llama riders who called him Haunted Man and asked him to sit and share a meal with them. He could sense strange magics around them, and realized they were heroquesting. The leader of the trio, an old old man, told him he would teach him the secret to keeping the dead from harassing the living.<br/><br/>And we ended it there! Garrath is getting swept up in some HeroQuesting, and the llama riders are on a HeroQuest of Daka Fal. The full quest is for Daka Fal to call upon the ancestors to protect the people from the Darkness, and Garrath is going to be dragged along as a companion on that quest (if possible) and there will be some strange and dangerous stuff that happens. Carly also intends him to heroquest for his congregation, and we're going to collaborate on what the myth of St. Henshelek finds the Seeds was and what happened during it. I have some ideas but I want to see what Carly thinks Henshelek was about and what sort of story events interest her.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437644/#Comment_437644" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-22T12:53:16+00:00" title="August 22, 2014 12:53PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2014 12:56PM by Bret_Gillan.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played a little bit more but it was a short session. I'll tell why in a second.<br/><br/>Garrath made camp with the Llama Riders and did the HeroQuest for Daka Fal. The old man who led the riders had Garrath smear ash on his eyes, drink some sort of alcohol mixed with blood, dance in a circle with the ghosts of his ancestors standing on the outside, and then walk away from them with his eyes closed. After that the ghosts had left, and they told him he was no long Haunted Man, but was now Peaceful Man. All along the way Garrath was kind of fumbling the ritual, and the young companions of the old priest of Daka Fal kept getting wide-eyed and gasping when he did things not in accordance to the ritual.<br/><br/>The ritual continued, and dark clouds moved overhead obscuring the stars, and trollkin and one enormous troll appeared around the edges of the campfire. They began pelting the group with stones and Garrath protected them with his shield. The priest called upon Garrath to ask his ancestors for help, and Garrath ran away from the fire, trying to lure the troll away. He succeeded, and the troll pursued him, swinging its enormous club.<br/><br/>We stopped here because Carly was getting really frustrated. The situation was that Garrath was stuck in a myth that he didn't know, so he was fumbling and getting some things wrong. Carly felt like that meant <b>she</b> was doing things wrong. I explained that wasn't the case, but she still felt frustrated so we took a break there. We might play more this weekend and find out what happens to Garrath and the troll.<br/><br/>Also, even though the young companions were surprised by what Garrath was doing, the priest wasn't. There are many myths about the gods, and many versions of those myths. So what I say, in a kind of retconny way but not really, is that those things that Garrath did that don't line up with the popular version of the myth are actually things that Haunted/Peaceful Man did in alternate tellings.<br/><br/>In my imagined version of the myth, drawn from the books, the events of the session that they were reenacting towards the end are when Daka Fal taught humans how to survive the Darkness. He taught them to call upon their ancestors for protection. However, instead of doing that, Garrath ran off to lure the troll away and fight it on his own. So I'm thinking there's an alternate version of the myth where Peaceful Man went into the Darkness and sacrificed himself to give the others time to call upon the ancestors for protection.<br/><br/>I'm way more interested in the ways that myths have layers, and how in Glorantha people can rewrite the myths, than in going YOU DID IT WRONG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
