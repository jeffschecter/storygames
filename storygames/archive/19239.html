We want to make something that is more specific to story games, and more searchable, but without all of the review/rating/forum features that RPG Geek has. We already have some ideas about the kinds of attributes we would like to add beyond what is available in RPG Geek and what we would like to not do, but I would like to ask a general question to everyone:<br/><br/>What problems do you have using RPG Geek? How could it be organized better for story games? And what kind of information about games would an ideal story games database include?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428662/#Comment_428662" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-23T14:10:34+00:00" title="February 23, 2014  2:10PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 23, 2014 2:11PM by James_Stuart.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey there! This is a project I've thought about a lot, in the "more than just a passing fancy, so I might as well register a domain name" type of way, but not an actual work way. I fully support you making something awesome.  Maybe I'll work on something too down the line, maybe we'll work together. Who knows?<br/><br/>Just from my thoughts and conversations I've already had on this:<br/><br/>1) The most important thing, by far, I'd want this to do is answer questions like:<br/><br/>"I've got five people and we want to play a freeform."<br/>"I've got five players plus me and we want to play something with no prep."<br/><br/>I often just find myself sifting through my games folder over and over trying to remember which games fit which setups.<br/><br/>2) One major hurdle is to think about what your inclusion criteria is: being encyclopedic is a lot of effort, and makes search more difficult (see #3) But once you start to limit down what's part of it, you get to all the fun (by which I mean, drama) of what is a story game? Do you accept playtests? Do you list every Game Chef game?<br/><br/>In the end, I don't think there's an easy answer here.<br/><br/>3) Search relevance rankings is actually really important. If I do the second search, and a nice picture of Lady Blackbird isn't in the first few images, then that's a bit weird. If GMless four player games don't include Fiasco near the top, also weird (not unjustifiable, just weird). But, coming up with search orders for searches is actually tricky. There's a lot of things you could do here, but it's an important thing to note that as the 'database' part gets more filled, the 'search' part gets harder to do well.<br/><br/>4) I'd want browsing to be seamless and fun: other than that RPGGeek is hideous to look at it, it's also very poor at just promoting discoverability. If I was putting on my web design hat, I was thinking about search/profiles as a SPA (Single Page Application).<br/><br/>Anyway, feel free to ignore all my advice. But that's my current thinking.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428663/#Comment_428663" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-23T14:17:07+00:00" title="February 23, 2014  2:17PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A wiki-style editing feature would be handy, and reduce your workload.

So if a lot of users likes Fiasco and Dogs in the Vineyard, and I have given Fiasco a high rating, then the database will suggest a high rating when I look at Dogs in the Vineyard.
