I was was wondering what other folks thought as well.<br/><br/>What behaviors does D&amp;D reward (specifically pre-2nd edition)? <br/><br/>My initial thoughts: In the 1974 edition it seems to me that it's pretty much stabby and acquiring treasure. But some games focus on exploration, puzzle solving etc.. which are not rewarded or rather rewards are not tied into the reward cycle. <br/><br/>*I am running Grinding Gear and thought about Death Frost Doom but D&amp;D doesn't seem to have mechanics to support either of these types of play. <br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>ara                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244752/#Comment_244752" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-02T22:26:31+00:00" title="December  2, 2009 10:26PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 2, 2009 11:08PM by whiteknife.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm running a Labyrinth Lord game right now (which clones some variant of 1st edition). <br/><br/>The setting is a huge old school multi-level dungeon that I found in my garage, written all the way back in the actually 70's by someone I know (not me). <br/><br/>So far rewarded behaviors I've seen include: <br/><br/><i>poking things with a ten foot pole, use of hirelings as bait, and general paranoia</i>- traps are everywhere and anything can be lethal<br/><i>getting loot at any cost</i>- gold is XP so loot is more important than later editions, as well as pretty much every other game I've played. Also there's no magic shops and basically no intrinsic rewards for level advancement unless you're a spellcaster, so loot takes on the role of character advancement as well. <br/><i>Fighting harshly and quickly</i>- If you don't start combat with the deck heavily stacked in your favor you may be just a few rolls away from a dead character, so be careful!<br/><br/>I've actually found the "loot as XP" thing to be my favorite part of early edition D&amp;D. Since there's no grand heroic plot (at least in the game I'm running, but the system isn't really supportive of that format from what I've seen, at least not until higher levels) loot becomes the driving force for exploration, puzzle solving, and all that. Put some gold and a magic item behind whatever you want the players to engage with and *BAM* instant reward cycle inclusion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244753/#Comment_244753" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-02T23:16:44+00:00" title="December  2, 2009 11:16PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2009 7:22AM by komradebob.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: akooser</cite>What behaviors does D&amp;D reward (specifically pre-2nd edition)?<br/></blockquote>\nIf my understanding of very early 0e D&amp;D is correct, it rewards playing regularly, because playing regularly means your characters will reach the end game quicker and , be able to whip the shit out of the other PCs in a series of tabletop miniatures battles once you've accumulated enough XPs + gold to found a kingdom, build a base, and support an army.<br/><br/>Edited to add:<br/><br/>Mind you, that's the social hobby context that 0e exists in around 1974. That context does seem to have changed rapidly, but my understanding is that those Biggie Sized game groups that some of the Ur-grognards mention ( 20 + player campaigns), really were working like that. And, in very early campaigns, the adventuring was more like a side activity that gave you benefits in the main, actual, core activity ( the table top miniatures wargames between armies).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244762/#Comment_244762" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T01:02:45+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  1:02AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ara,<br/>\n  Well, I have seen two modes of play, each has different reward cycles I think:<br/>\n1) Uninformed play - this is the typical kill things and take their stuff mode. I think there is a  swath of gamers (myself included) that read the rules, didn't fill in the blanks and played it by the book. It seems like Basic D&amp;D supported mercenary behaviour as well as paranoia.<br/>\n2) Informed play - There also seemed to be a large portion of gamers who had some insight into the design intent. For those players, the game was about having fun with riddles puzzles and optimized play (for instance the fact the wandering monsters provided no treasure meant lallygagging around searching every foot of the dungeon was a lethal idea). The rewarded behaviour here seems to be outthinking the GM and efficient use of resources.<br/>\n  I know a lot more about the uninformed play, so feel free to ask any questions about that that come to mind...<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244814/#Comment_244814" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T07:38:43+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  7:38AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whiteknife:<br/><i>poking things with a ten foot pole, use of hirelings as bait, and general paranoia</i><br/>Other then not having your characters resources depleted how is behavior reward? <br/><br/><i>getting loot at any cost</i><br/>I like this part it's been fun as the ref and I think the players are having fun with this too. <br/><br/><i>Fighting harshly and quickly</i><br/>We are using the simple initiative from Spells and Swords coupled with d6 hit points makes combat somewhat grim.

The group I played with (MITSGS, bunches of GMs with linked games) did the wandering around the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Outdoor Survival</span> board with a small army for maybe a couple of months, top, before switching over to dungeons embedded in moderately realized fantasy worlds (at least a couple of the GM's plundered their trunk novels for settings).  Then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greyhawk_(supplement)" rel="nofollow">Greyhawk</a> came out, and the localized MITSGS style developed: OD&amp;D + Greyhawk, magic rules that made magic weaker and more frequent (spell preparation, klutz factor and/or spell points and a modified spell list), and a deemphasis on, and later a removal of, experience from treasure.  But magical treasure continued to be part of the reward system, since good magic items could improve your character as much or more than leveling.  (Magic inflation became a problem, since humanoid opponents needed good magical equipment to face the player characters in battle, and if you made all of it evil, it broke suspension of disbelief something fierce.  And the players almost always won.)  Of course, with realized fantasy worlds, it became possible to obtain political rewards, too, and a lot of players went for those as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244843/#Comment_244843" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T09:14:07+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  9:14AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't been playing old D&amp;D by the rules lately, but my own houseruled version has a lot of similarities - at least the way I see old D&amp;D, anyway. The primary reward in how I play is always in-fiction; whatever the characters are trying to accomplish, that's what they get (or don't get), and the consequences are are whatever they are. Specifically, XP is not a reward, it's just a pacing mechanism for how the overall situation in the campaign changes. Treasure is solidly part of the in-fiction reward state; it is not usually tracked carefully in abstracted gold pieces, and generally speaking what you can do with the wealth is much more important than how much you have.<br/><br/>To put it simply: the reward in saving the princess is that you saved the princess. Players choose adventures where they find the stakes rewarding.<br/><br/>As for whether this matches old D&amp;D, that's a tricky question. It's very personal, we've all had to form our own attitudes towards the ideas D&amp;D has. Many elements of the rules are fulcrums with radically changing roles depending on your overall agenda. Experience points, for instance - if your version of D&amp;D includes clearly level-dependent stages of play (you get your own castle at level 9, for example), while you might also lose experience points by dying and having to start up a new character, then experience points might well be interpreted as a reward. But then, there are many styles of play in which those ideas are not involved at all, so it's not a given that xp has this role.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244934/#Comment_244934" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T14:00:28+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  2:00PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: akooser</cite><br/><i>poking things with a ten foot pole, use of hirelings as bait, and general paranoia</i><br/>Other then not having your characters resources depleted how is behavior reward?<br/><br/><i>Fighting harshly and quickly</i><br/>We are using the simple initiative from Spells and Swords coupled with d6 hit points makes combat somewhat grim.

So yeah, no resources depleted. However, since I personally come from a background with lots and lots of 3rd and 4th edition play, often among optimizers and at high levels, the lethality is standing out to me as I play the earlier editions.<br/><br/>As for how stuff outside of looting and killing stuff fits: <br/>NPC interactions can lead to them helping you kill stuff or they can help you get loot, so there's a reason to do that.<br/><br/>Building up a castle or whatever for yourself can lead to more power, but it also has a huge "cool factor" to it: often the reason for getting loot and killing things is to show how awesome you are, and having your own personal castle does that just as well.<br/><br/>Other than that nothing is explicitly rewarded (at least in text, some GMs give role-playing or quest XP or whatever), but a lot of it can just generally be fun so people do it out of intrinsic motivation, but it's not always a given.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244961/#Comment_244961" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T17:24:11+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  5:24PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Peter: Can you tell me more about MITSGS?

I don't think so, but then I think that the whole concept of character effectiveness is an analytical dead end to begin with. We might as well discuss perceived player satisfaction. In my experience the fictional rewards influence the context and content of challenges, but does not make them "easier" to resolve. For example, if you have an army thanks to how well you've played so far, that just means that now you're facing army-type challenges. Those are not necessarily easier or harder than before, just different. Similarly rich characters and poor characters, or characters well-connected in the society vs. loner types. All of those things affect the direction of play, but do not directly translate into power. Magic items are a type of wealth that <i>does</i> become power, but then I view those pretty much as just another form of character experience - and as I explained before, experience means that things which used to be challenges are not anymore, and things which used to be insurmountable facts now become challenges.<br/><br/>Let's see if I can clarify this with an example. Let's say that we have the Dragonlance campaign, which begins with the entire homeland of the heroes becoming under the attack of evil dragon armies. The low level of the characters in this situation effectively means that the assault of the dragon armies is not and cannot be characterized as a challenge for the party (this is partly by convention, I admit; the GM won't entertain other options and the players won't try them); it's just a background fact for their real mission, which involves the challenge of avoiding and fighting small scouting parties of evil humanoids. Later on, as the characters grow in power, this balance turns upside down: fighting scouting parties of evil humanoids becomes a non-issue for high-level characters, and thus should not be characterized as a challenge, while stopping the war itself becomes the real challenge (a thoroughly scripted one in case of Dragonlance, but let's imagine for a second that we're playing a real game within the context here). In this way the accumulation of experience points and mighty weapons has caused the focus of the game to shift; I view this as the primary role that experience points and magical equipment have in D&amp;D-style games. By having an arc of character development these games enforce a changing challenge environment, ensuring that adventures do not repeat the same old situations for ever and ever.<br/><br/>(Of course, there's plenty of gaming material out there that does its very best to actively counteract these shifts in the challenge environment. The classical idiocy involves a game designer who first introduces a powerful spell or such into the campaign environment and then spends his time trying to figure out ways to annul the significance of that spell in resolving situations. All sorts of anti-magic fields are a fine example of this, the GM doesn't want to accept the fact that the characters have moved on from the challenge environments of the past, so he does his very best to pretend that the characters can't scry, teleport and instantly kill everything they know about.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244984/#Comment_244984" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T19:12:42+00:00" title="December  3, 2009  7:12PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero: Thanks for the clarification and example!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245011/#Comment_245011" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T22:06:45+00:00" title="December  3, 2009 10:06PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ara,<br/>\n  Well, the way we played, two things informed my play. I preferred to play a magic user, so that meant I wanted to level up BAD. I mean 1d4+CON HPs is exactly something to sneeze at. Honestly I wasn't that excited about magic items, except those that improve AC. Um, I resisted the urge to be greedy, but the XPs for GPs conundrum meant I tried to be careful to get my fair share once there was honest money to be had. In fact, those were the most tense moments in the game. determining how to divvy up the treasure. WAY more tense than the fights.<br/>\n  I think some elements of the game did not make sense to us. For instance, Henchmen. The GM did not want to deal with that many NPCs runnig around, so we generally did not use henchmen. XPs for GPs, we did not use this rule consistently, I mean, it was obvious that the XP table considered GPs for XPs i their values, but it didn't make sense to get XPs for making money. Building castles didn't make any sense ot us either.<br/>\n  So, our rewards were saving the good guys from the bad guys and leveling up. Magic items, money, followers and castles were just incidental events for us.<br/>\n  I rambled a little, but I think I answered your question, no?<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245021/#Comment_245021" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-03T23:12:17+00:00" title="December  3, 2009 11:12PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: akooser</cite>Peter: Can you tell me more about MITSGS?

Just for background, MITSGS stood for MIT (like in Massachusetts Institute of Technology) Strategic Games Society.  Oddly enough, somewhat less than half the members were actually MIT students (I started showing up there in junior high school).  A bunch of hardcore wargamers, who got a hold of white box D&amp;D at, or maybe slightly before publication.   Maybe 40-50 people, maybe half of which played D&amp;D (later there were more, but not at the time of the transition).<br/><br/>But really, the wilderness phase, was, if I remember correctly (this <em>was</em> 35 years ago!) very brief, and was a result of early readings of the rules.  Also, Kevin Slimak, who had shown up with the rules after a trip to Lake Geneva, probably had been exposed to a dungeon there, and once he started running his Hellsgate dungeon, it was widely copied.  Also, dungeon encounters were far more survivable than wilderness encounters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245175/#Comment_245175" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-04T14:50:48+00:00" title="December  4, 2009  2:50PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Peter: Totally separate question.

I'll keep an eye out for it, but no promises.  I am not aware of any it being scanned, however.

Alas, issues are about impossible to come by, and the rights to scan or reprint them would be ... complicated (many of the major contributors have been out of the hobby for decades and at least one is dead).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245200/#Comment_245200" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-04T20:07:02+00:00" title="December  4, 2009  8:07PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometime I need to go through the bits I saved from The Wild Hunt (sometime in college I gave up on storing the whole collection and pulled them apart, I have most of Glen Blacow's zines from whenever my TWH collection started).

I remember several items that came with envelopes with information about the item that the player didn't know, to be read by the GM of any other game that they played in.<br/><br/>For people who weren't there: a bunch of the older MITSGS D&amp;D games had territories distributed around a world map that Mark Swanson (the co-editor of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Wild Hunt</span>) drew up one day.  Others were connected by interdimensional nexi.  The rules between games were, while not identical, were generally similar, and characters were allowed to move between games, although magic items were subject to "customs".  Most players had a mix of low, medium and (eventually ) high level characters (it took <em>years</em> of regular play to get to higher than 12th level), and would pull out a character of the appropriate level and alignment to match the adventure the GM had prepared (sometimes a GM would prepare more than one).  People sometimes also transferred characters from other games, but the more the rules varied, the harder it was.<br/><br/>Later founded MITSGS games also practiced a large amount of inter-game character hopping, but I know less about that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245205/#Comment_245205" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-04T21:11:33+00:00" title="December  4, 2009  9:11PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience, there's basically been two modes of play:<br/><br/>1.
