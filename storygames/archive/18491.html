Not issues with the game itself but ones that rise from my lack of knowledge of the genre. I don't read or watch paranormal romance or teen monster anything. Recently I've started - after talking to a friend who is more familiar with the genre and things I have read here - to change my point of view to more accurately reflect the genre. This has solved a lot of my issues (save that I don't like the direction of the Vampire or how every player of the Queen I have seen - in my games - is as dramatic out of character as in) but it has resulted in a question I never had before.<br/><br/>Gazing into the Abyss. Where does it come from genre wise? Is it a staple of these genres that everyone has psychic visions? It just doesn't seem to fit or make sense to me.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416186/#Comment_416186" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-13T12:52:32+00:00" title="June 13, 2013 12:52PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not really an expert on the genre, but I believe the intent is for <b>gazing into the abyss</b> to represent those moments when the PCs struggle with their (non-literal, mostly) internal demons. So yes, some of them may  make contact with something deep and dark and powerful when seeking answers, but I've also seen characters who just went for a ride through the woods on their bike in order to "get away from everything and think" or who make a video diary of their inner-most feelings. It's whatever works as a way for your characters to resolve their issues through introspection.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416188/#Comment_416188" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-13T13:15:45+00:00" title="June 13, 2013  1:15PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a good question for Mcdaldno since I also don't know where it comes from genre-wise, but here's me hazarding a guess: It's NOT a show convention, but an element to make it function better as an RPG, and a holdover from Apocalypse World. ApW, if you don't know it, has this thing called the Psychic Maelstrom, and every character can innately tap into it to get some answers. It acts as a tool that a lot of players can go to when they don't know what to do and need some MC guidance. The move lets characters drive the plot forward without just straight asking the MC where they should go next.<br/><br/>That's kinda how I've seen it. James is probably right about the idea of internal demons, but even with that I have a tough time with literally getting visions as a genre convention.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416190/#Comment_416190" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-13T13:38:35+00:00" title="June 13, 2013  1:38PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gazing into the Abyss is the research move, and needn't be psychic to get visions.

It is often research-oriented: consulting occult tomes that are inexplicably lying around the school library, the infamous google montage. It is often navel-gazing: dropping ketamine in your basement, flipping through old photo albums while sobbing mascara all over your bedspread.<br/><br/><b><i>The Google Montage</i></b> is the most notorious and awkward example throughout the genre. It happens in Twilight, Buffy, The Vampire Diaries, Ginger Snaps, and several others. A character (almost always a girl for some reason) has overwhelming suspicions about the True Nature of a mysterious friend. They plug some innocuous phrase into Google, like "pale skin" or "hair growth." Through a series of close-up shots of their shocked face and their computer screen, displaying hackey purple-and-black rudimentary-html-skill websites,  we see them learn the truth about Vampires/Werewolves/Witches/Themselves/Whatever.<br/><br/>There are a lot of different gazing into the abyss variations in Buffy, but "No Place Like Home" (S5E5) is perhaps the most clear and textbook example. Buffy learns that her sister Dawn might be a figment. She takes some weird magic drugs and enters a slowed state of awareness where colors flicker and things are revealed to be what they truly are. She looks at a family photo. Dawn's face quickly fades out of it. <i>Dawn isn't real!</i><br/><br/>Finally, watch this music video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtOToiIDNRA" rel="nofollow">Hollywood Forever Cemetary Sings</a>. <i>(trigger warnings: drug abuse, murder, blood, possible kidnapping.)</i> When she smokes that apple &amp; gets wasted while searching for meaning? Gazing into the abyss. Out in the woods, when the fog rolls in and shows her both what she wants and what she must do?

Not even from reading actual play reports of the game. I get the whole basic idea of the move but just saying make a roll and have visions strikes me as a deus ex machina move. It's out of place with everything else I have seen. All of the other moves are social. They create conflict and drive scenes. Gazing into the Abyss takes you out of social interaction to have "visions".<br/><br/>Things like the Google Montage don't need a roll, I feel. Its an info dump. Nothing interesting there mechanically for a game like this. It doesn't even come close to being in line with the Dark stat as it's described - which is all I can go with as I am learning a system. <br/><br/>And if it sounds like I'm arguing here I'm not. I'm just trying to make sense of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416197/#Comment_416197" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-13T14:13:51+00:00" title="June 13, 2013  2:13PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2013 2:22PM by horn_head_o.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I think in my interpretation it's less for laziness and more for genuine confusion (and you can't <i>just</i> do it, there has to be some kind of fictional actions going on of course, so it's not always that easy). In AW yes it's a setting element, but not only a setting element, it has game purpose (esp. since it establishes a thing that's not really common in post-apoc movies in a game about the archetypes of post-apoc movies). But like I said, I was just taking a guess, and Joe's answer here is definitely way better.<br/><br/>EDIT: you posted out from under me, give me a sec<br/>Maybe you haven't seen it used that way, and I've never used it as a research (usually as visions) but I think it still works. Not every move needs to be social necessarily. Hold Steady isn't really social either a lot of the time  (in my experience). And I think it CAN drive scenes, it just drives the <i>next</i> scene. Getting visions is adding more stuff into the narrative that you may not have had the tools to figure out otherwise. And sometimes, on rare occasions, it's created scenes all of their own - I have this one memorable use of the move where I (the Hollow) interacted with the Infernal's Dark Power directly.<br/>I definitely see your point though. I've also used the move several times in ways that had me in solitude. I just think that's okay sometimes - in the genre, characters sometimes spend time alone, reflecting.<br/>And an info dump isn't a bad thing. It's not mechanical, but it can fill a gap. If your character isn't really in the drama between other characters, a single vision can throw you into the thick of it in a natural way. And sometimes all the clues just aren't there or you as a player really are lost. These are the times I go to Gaze Into The Abyss.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416198/#Comment_416198" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-13T14:17:39+00:00" title="June 13, 2013  2:17PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>First off I appreciate you posting here and trying to answer my question.<br/><br/>What you are describing is not how I have ever seen the move used. </blockquote>\nOkay.<br/><br/>So you can inform the people you play with that this is how it's meant to be used.<br/>Or you can remove or replace it.<br/><br/>Either way, I hope your games are fruitful and rich.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416203/#Comment_416203" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-13T15:03:24+00:00" title="June 13, 2013  3:03PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Gazing into the Abyss is the research move, and needn't be psychic to get visions.

In Apocalypse World, characters can open their brains to the psychic maelstrom. What is that psychic maelstrom? How does it all work? Totally up to the players. What it does is serve as a tool for infodumping, with some interesting consequences. You can certainly consider it a deus ex machina, but it's one that's baked in, just as it is in the plays from which the term comes. You go to see one of those plays, the deus ex machine's just one of the conventions used in the play.<br/><br/>I agree that you don't need a roll to use Google, but that's not what Gazing Into the Abyss means. It means finding the information on whatever topic you're gazing into the abyss about.<br/><br/>In other words, there's the mechanic, and there's the chrome. The mechanic is: roll dice when you try to find out something, and it doesn't have to something your character has any logical way of knowing. What you roll lets you know whether you find out anything and what the consequences are. MCs can veto requests that seem off to them, but should err on the side of saying yes.<br/><br/>The chrome is whatever you want it to be. It can be googling, because this isn't about using the computer the way we do in real life. It's about using it to find out stuff that has no business being online -- but suddenly, because of that roll, it's online. The player's decision made that part of the world -- and remember, the player is the one who decides what the chrome is. (Once it's part of the world, maybe other people know about it too. This makes absolutely no logical sense. We're in the realm of psychomachia, of dream logic, of books I've read where, once the protagonist learns something, everyone seems to know it, even though no one seemed to know it before. Or maybe no one else knows about it until there's a logical in game reason.)<br/><br/>If it makes your head hurt less, maybe the PC did some serious research, not just googling, but a montage of searching out ever more obscure websites, finding ways of getting passwords to even more obscure ones, maybe even going to a library or crawling through used bookstores, and the key thing is correlating all the data no one's put together before.<br/><br/>Like I said, the chrome can be whatever you want it to be. Player choice, and if you're the MC, you can encourage your players to come up with descriptions that are more interesting than "I google it".<br/><br/>But the deus ex machina element is baked in.

With your assurance that it isn't though, I'll try to read it as charitably as possible.<br/><br/>I think a big trouble is yes, you're latching onto the literal words used. Apocalypse World and its hacks often use singular words as metaphors for whole types of things. The metaphor is chosen to enhance the elegance and genre-feeling of certain moves. ApW has Act Under Fire, but it triggers any time you act while there is active pressure on you. However, Act Under Fire sounds more fitting than Act Under Pressure, so it was used, with "under fire" being used as a metaphor.<br/>Visions, similarly, are a metaphor for obtaining information on a personal level that you would not have been able to figure out on your own. That's how I'm narrowing it down right now at least, and probably isn't exactly the meaning, but it's close.

If I have a question I just ask it. Any frustration I have at the moment is due to being accused of things.<br/><br/>Onto the metaphors... this is a tricky thing. Metaphors have to be used carefully. Act Under Fire - while being phrased somewhat oddly - is an easily and immediately understood metaphor. Barring English not being someone's first language the meaning is clear. Same for Turning Someone On, Shutting Them Down, Lashing Out, Running Away, and Holding Steady. All are easily understood simply from reading the name. They are clear and evoke the nature of the Move. They give you the spirit of the law as well as the literal.<br/><br/>Then we come to Gazing into the Abyss. This is a term usually used to refer to coming face to face with horror and it's impact on you. If a philosophy student or a psychologist uses the phrase that is what he means. Thematically it's what this phrase has been assumed to mean for many years. From reading the name virtually no one would read it and say "Oh that must be how I get information". The logic doesn't flow. Then we get to the actual phrasing of the Move in which it says to have visions. It gives no alternate examples like what people have been given here but that flows into the comments of me "latching" onto definitions.<br/><br/>If I cannot use the definitions of the words in the description how am I supposed to understand it? Even metaphors must make sense in context. Even if it requires someone to explain it to you. Language only has meaning in the definitions we give it. <br/><br/>So - in my thoughts - if this Move does not represent dealing with horror and your reaction to it then it needs to be rewritten. Re-Skinned as it were. Something to make it clearer what it's purpose is without losing what it is meant to be. Allow me to attempt to do so.\n<blockquote><b>Seek the Light</b><br/><br/>When you seek the light roll with dark and ask the MC a question. On a successful roll it answers your question.

Now here is how I would do Gaze Into the Abyss based off what the phrase means to me and what it means to most.\n<blockquote><b>Gaze Into The Abyss</b><br/><br/>When you gaze into the abyss roll with dark. On a 10+ choose one:<br/><br/>- Breakdown; give a witness to your breakdown a String on you and take one on them<br/>- Harden your heart; remove one String on you but gain the condition Flinty<br/>- Wall yourself away; give up one String you have on another to remove all conditions on yourself<br/><br/>On a 7-9 choose one:<br/><br/>- Give a witness a String on you<br/>- Go numb; replace a current condition with the dazed condition (or gain it if you have no conditions)<br/>- Flee the scene crying  <br/><br/>You gaze into the abyss whenever you face the darkness in your life. If you express horror at finding your murdered teacher you are gazing into the abyss. If you break down because your boyfriend slept with your best friend you are gazing into the abyss. If you see the Infernal give someone to the Dark Power and you express horror you are gazing into the abyss. If you are the Infernal and your Dark Power makes you give someone to them and you express guilt you gazing into the abyss. If you have done something and you ask yourself "What have I done?" you are gazing into the abyss. <br/><br/>This Move is all about pain and fear. It's about dealing with all the shit life throws at you like a fastball and it's about sharing it with the world. Just like every Move it should move the action forward. Preferably by complicating an interaction or driving an interaction. It's a mechanical reason to react like a real person.</blockquote>\nThat Move is rough but I did just come up with it while writing the post.

I personally don't have much trouble seeing it metaphorically there, but it's totally worth it to just re-skin it if it works better for you, cuz your Seek The Light is totally a fine move to use instead.<br/><br/>As for your new Gaze (which it might be worth renaming, at least temporarily, just to prevent any confusion between the book's and your's since both are in this conversation), my big question would be: Is this stepping on the toes of Hold Steady? Mechanically it's quite different, but every circumstance you list as a trigger, I would usually jump straight to Hold Steady. Is this the more extreme version of Hold Steady for special situations? Is it when these terrible things are happening and you intentionally keep looking in at them? That's my biggest concern. My other worry is that the 10+ is always still partially negative, it's always some kind of failure even when you succeed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadmanshand" title="deadmanshand"><img alt="deadmanshand" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadmanshand">deadmanshand</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416257/#Comment_416257" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-14T00:42:06+00:00" title="June 14, 2013 12:42AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2013 12:44AM by deadmanshand.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not the same as Hold Steady. It doesn't even fall into the same territory. Hold Steady is literally holding on the face of terror. It's all about dealing with fear in the present tense. It's the MC looking at you and saying "The werewolf is charging you Hold Steady to see if you keep your cool".<br/><br/>My Gaze Into The Abyss is the aftermath of dealing with the terror. It's when you internalize everything. Actually take everything in and start to freak out. It's that wrack and purge when the tidal wave of shit finally comes down on you. When everything gets too much and all the walls come crumbling down. It's about coming face to face with all the crap inside of us and how waht we experience changes us.<br/><br/>The whole design for this is based off of my studies into PTSD and other stress related disorders.<br/><br/>In a manner it's the internal version of Hold Steady. It's how you deal with all the angst. As for the results of the 10+ I intentionally made them partly negative. Breaking down is narratively good as it creates tension and drama but it's not generally good for the person doing it. At least that's my thinking right now and I am awfully tired.<br/><br/>I guess I could ask how would you do it?<br/><br/>Edit: Almost missed your post, Lisa. On a 6 or less... depends on how hard a move the MC wants to make but trying - and failing - to deal with these kind of things can get really messy.*<br/><br/>*I really tried my hardest not to grin while typing that.

For example, your examples of finding the murdered teacher and seeing the Infernal hand someone over to their Dark Power are both instances that you would Hold Steady in. I see you used "express horror at" in those examples, and now I see kinda what you were going for (that when they settle in and the fear hits them on a personal level), but I think expressing horror at those situations is also an in-the-moment thing that triggers Hold Steady. Other cases from the examples that DO work for me are "when you break down" over the trauma, when you "express guilt," and the last broad one. So I think the dual possibility of how to use "express horror at" threw me, so consider rewording that bit to something obviously not "in the moment". Maybe even keep "express horror" but specify "after the incident" or some such to clarify.<br/>However, I think that if it's Gazing (as a phrase), it'd be in those moments of terror that you see the Abyss and freak out, and <i>that's</i> kinda like Hold Steady. So I love the idea of the move, of that breakdown moment, but I'm not sure that a breakdown and Gazing Into The Abyss (as a phrase) line up for me. Mind explaining that further/clarifying it for me? Cuz I think it's interesting, and just don't see it personally.<br/><br/>I agree that those breakdowns usually aren't good for a character, but if the move is DEALING with a breakdown then success should be succeeding at dealing with it. I feel like "Flee Crying" and "Go Numb" aren't really succeeding at dealing with it at all and that those would be more like failures. Comparatively, the Witness/Hardened Heart/Walling Away all have good and bad elements but still are somewhat dealing with it, which makes them sound great as partial successes. That would leave you without rules for "what happens when you successfully deal with your breakdown" - something ON TOP of "you hold your shit together."<br/><br/>Those are just the sort of impressions I get running over the text. Am I doing more misinterpreting or is the wording just kinda messed up? I like the intent and ideas and such, it's just in the wordings that I'm getting all tripped up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416274/#Comment_416274" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-14T09:07:28+00:00" title="June 14, 2013  9:07AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think, for the reworked Gaze Into the Abyss, it would work best if you specifically made it an "aftermath" move.

After having all these conversations, I've come to the conclusion that the vagueness is potentially a good thing, or a feature: like Hold Steady, it can be applied to all kinds of different situations and used as a tool with different applications. <br/><br/>I like the direction this thread is going in:<br/><br/>Your rewrite of "seek the light" is a good re-interpretation of the move, and Joe clearly agrees. I don't know if I like the implications of the wording as much (it sounds very positive, whereas gazing into the abyss is sometimes more self-destructive), but it helps me understand the move a little better, which is always a good thing.<br/><br/>I always thought that Dark gets under-used in Monsterhearts games, and could use either more clarity, a more active formulaton, or some additional moves. It might be interesting to use *both* of these moves together, making Dark a stat that's attached to two different moves.<br/><br/>However, I would add that, if we're going to deal with the "aftermath" as a process, I would want to structure the move as much as possible so as to include other characters/players. I would want the structure of the move to lead to new interactions: maybe the character makes themselves vulnerable to someone else, or needs someone else to recover, or they must shift the blame to someone and lash out in some way... something which creates further situations and drives the characters to seek one another out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadmanshand" title="deadmanshand"><img alt="deadmanshand" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadmanshand">deadmanshand</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416390/#Comment_416390" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-15T21:52:01+00:00" title="June 15, 2013  9:52PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2013 9:58PM by deadmanshand.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul_T: Light can blind - all the self destruction is still there.

I just like this write up because it feels a little more focused to me.<br/><br/>Making Dark more active is part of my plan with Seek the Light and my version of Gaze Into The Abyss. Make it less of a solitary or largely passive stat and give the players something to run with. I feel like the Monsterhearts move set in particular works better as an engine than as a framework. Make everything provide impetus - forward motion - in all activities. That way there is no wasted action. No wrong move to make. No getting lost. Make every Move feed off of each other till everything explodes in a maelstrom of hormones, angst, and blood.<br/><br/>Incidentally the same mindset I had towards my prom.

I feel as if Joe's original intent behind Gaze may get focused by your deeper understanding of the human condition rather than the original teenage gut reaction.<br/><br/>I like Gaze as is, as a montage, a means to be overwhelmed and revel in it... As Paul astutely points out: a means to be narratively vague and explore that dark vagaries that lurk there. <br/><br/>And for me? Gaze was always about wanting to have an intense scene of enlightened hedonism with no regard for the consequence.<br/><br/>I like your custom moves and re-wordings, and the intent behind them, I just prefer the metaphorically amorphous nature of the original and the resultant jejune yet ambiguously abstruce scenes it seems to evince.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadmanshand" title="deadmanshand"><img alt="deadmanshand" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadmanshand">deadmanshand</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416469/#Comment_416469" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T07:16:40+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  7:16AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My Gaze is not based off of a gut reaction. Nor do I believe the original was about enlightened hedonism. It was meant to be a get in touch with your dark side and learn something. It never had an element of hedonism to it. Not from the examples in the book nor examples I've been given. That is what it says in the book and how I have seen it used in the actual plays I've been reading.<br/><br/>Gaze Into the Abyss - for all games I run - will be replaced by Seek the Light. Effectively Seek the Light and my version of Gaze split the original intention of Gaze into two separate but - in my opinion - fuller and more active actions. Seek being a heedless search for answers. That self destructive urge to know the truth at all costs when the world tells you you don't need to know. Sometimes the world is right. That's where Hard Moves come in.<br/><br/>My Gaze is based off of my studies and it makes sense in the light of teenagers. The whole point of this game is about not having control and dealing with the aftermath of that. It only makes sense to have a move representing that breakdown in the wake of all the shit. Call it a Cathartic Move. When it works you come through the stress a little bit steadier but when it fails that's when teens have breakdowns. When it really fails... I would imagine a Darkest Self is not so far behind. Depending on how I word the Move I have the feeling it could be one of the darkest moves in the game. <br/><br/>Part of me - correct me if I'm wrong about this Mcdaldno - feels as if Gaze was originally intended partly as a carthartic move. Or at least that would have been a viable interpretation of it. Under the base rules if someone broke down I would certainly say "Sounds like you're Gazing Into The Abyss". I just wanted to make the moves more active. Generate a little more impetus and clear up what actually constitutes the moves. As well as provide another option for player driven emotional chaos.

Where does it come from genre wise? Is it a staple of these genres that everyone has psychic visions?</blockquote>\nTo answer the OP, visions of some kind are relatively common in the genre. Buffy, I recall, had the occasional supernatural dream or vision; one of the Charmed girls had glimpses of the future; ditto Cordelia in Angel. I think there's someone similar in the Twilight series.\n<blockquote>Gazing into the Abyss is the research move, and needn't be psychic to get visions. In fact with about half the skins it's better if it isn't; the Queen should do a bitchy backstabbing phone-around montage.</blockquote>\nI agree you needn't be psychic, but I really disagree that it's the "research move". It's not just about the provision of information; it's also about the character connecting with the supernatural part of themselves. It might be appropriate for the Queen (and only the Queen) to have a phone-around, but there should be a supernatural element to it. If their abyss is entirely normal and benign then how is the MC supposed to herald the abyss as a hard move?\n<blockquote>The AW Move sounds like a setting element. If it is what you say in MH it's just a lazy Move for players. "I don't want to work it out on my own. Let me roll some dice so you can tell me what to do."</blockquote>\nIt's definitely not that. MH isn't an investigative game; there's nothing necessarily for the players to work out on their own. Apart from other things, I use Gaze into the Abyss as a means to communicate between the MC and the player through the game (without having to meta-game it). If I'm the MC and I want to point to a particular aspect of the PC that I think would be interesting to explore then I'll use a vision of that. Alternatively, depending on the question, I'll allow the player or another player to create part of the vision, which gives me a feel for what they're thinking.<br/>\n<blockquote>What you are describing is not how I have ever seen the move used. Not even from reading actual play reports of the game.</blockquote>\nTry my ones:<br/><a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=15239" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=15239</a><br/>and<br/><a href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=162&amp;t=13122" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ukroleplayers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=162&amp;t=13122</a><br/>"Georgia and Chase are left alone together, but events do not transpire as the Ghoul might have hoped as Chase rebuffs her advances. She tries to provoke his darkest self, but for first time in a long time he's calm. He is about to be cured. Deep within himself, however, he feels a knot of anxiety. He feels the wolf-spirit buried deep down within his psyche, it is howling a warning. Within his mind, Chase sees two different futures - one, where he is human, only human, once more and his friends are dead and the town of Purgatory is burning to the ground - and a second, where he is the wolf-monster, but he is a warrior fighting alongside others to defend what he holds dear. <br/><br/>Chase emerges from the vision exhausted (Chase's player rolled a partial success in Gazing into the Abyss and chose to have lucid visions, but leave Chase drained) just as Tracy the Scooby return with the wolfsbane cure."\n<blockquote>I get the whole basic idea of the move but just saying make a roll and have visions strikes me as a deus ex machina move. It's out of place with everything else I have seen. All of the other moves are social. They create conflict and drive scenes. Gazing into the Abyss takes you out of social interaction to have "visions".</blockquote>\nI don't see a problem with that. None of the other basic moves address the supernatural nature of the game either. You could lift them all and put them in a Beverley Hills 90201 hack. I've got no problem with a move that specifically references the supernatural part of the game.<br/><br/>And I don't see how Gaze into the Abyss doesn't have the potential to create conflict and drive scenes. In my first linked AP above, the Ghost gazes into the abyss and discovers that his good friend and fellow PC was responsible for killing him. Plenty of conflict and scene driving there.\n<blockquote>Things like the Google Montage don't need a roll, I feel. Its an info dump. Nothing interesting there mechanically for a game like this. It doesn't even come close to being in line with the Dark stat as it's described.</blockquote>\nI agree. I wouldn't say that googling something is gazing into the abyss; there needs to be a supernatural element to it otherwise the abyss could never gaze back.\n<blockquote>Onto the metaphors... this is a tricky thing. Metaphors have to be used carefully\u2026 snip\u2026 Then we come to Gazing into the Abyss. This is a term usually used to refer to coming face to face with horror and it's impact on you. If a philosophy student or a psychologist uses the phrase that is what he means. Thematically it's what this phrase has been assumed to mean for many years. From reading the name virtually no one would read it and say "Oh that must be how I get information". The logic doesn't flow. </blockquote>\nI agree that the designer doesn't use 'gaze into the abyss' as it would be regularly understood, but all understanding must come from context and - placed in the context of its subsequent description and the effects of the move - I didn't have a problem understanding the designer's meaning.<br/><br/>I think a fundamental difference of perspective here is my understanding of the relationship of the PCs and the abyss. You see that the abyss is symbolic of horror; I agree, but I also see the PCs as part of that horror. They are monsters. Teenagers, yes, but also monsters. They are creations/children of the abyss and so, for me, them gazing into it is them connecting to the horror/supernatural that spawned them in the first place. The Nietzsche quote that philosophy students and psychologists would recognise is about monsters and becoming more monstrous. I think actually knowing more about the quote brings it closer to its Monsterhearts' usage than just knowing how it is colloquially used.<br/><br/>(And actually I'd dispute that Shutting someone down is easily understood (as we've had a lengthy thread around that confusion on this very forum). While the name of Gaze into the Abyss is more confusing than Shut Down, the short description in the PC handbook makes its purpose far clearer than Shut Down.)                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard" title="EpistolaryRichard"><img alt="EpistolaryRichard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">EpistolaryRichard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416502/#Comment_416502" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T14:39:40+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  2:39PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2013 2:45PM by EpistolaryRichard.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Even metaphors must make sense in context.

Language only has meaning in the definitions we give it. </blockquote>\nI agree with the sentiment, but I think the game adequately defines what 'gaze into the abyss' is meant to mean in this context.\n<blockquote>Seek the Light\u2026 </blockquote>\nFor me, "seeking the light" has a heavy religious connotation, which isn't what the move is about and isn't what the game is about either. <br/><br/>You write a lot about the importance of logical flow, and I'm afraid I don't get the logical flow of rolling with dark to "seek the light".<br/><br/>I understand why you're replacing "visions" with "information" based on what some others in this thread have posted, but - for me - it strips a lot of the atmosphere from the move. Information could be the phone number for the local pizza place; it could be what my homework assignment is. Confusing and alarming visions I can understand; confusing and alarming _information_ I struggle with. <br/><br/>As I've said above, the move has to have something of the supernatural about it. I'd be fine with the Queen having a 'more-than-natural' phone-circle if that was what their abyss was. But if I had a werewolf who's previously established a connection with a greater wolf-spirit as his abyss and then he decided decided to call up some friends then I wouldn't be down with him rolling that. That really would just make it into a lazy research move which gazing into the abyss really isn't.<br/>\n<blockquote>Gaze Into The Abyss<br/><br/>When you gaze into the abyss roll with dark. On a 10+ choose one:<br/><br/>- Breakdown; give a witness to your breakdown a String on you and take one on them<br/>- Harden your heart; remove one String on you but gain the condition Flinty<br/>- Wall yourself away; give up one String you have on another to remove all conditions on yourself<br/><br/>On a 7-9 choose one:<br/><br/>- Give a witness a String on you<br/>- Go numb; replace a current condition with the dazed condition (or gain it if you have no conditions)<br/>- Flee the scene crying <br/><br/>...what does everyone think about my version of Gazing Into The Abyss?</blockquote>\nI think my main problem with this is that you're trying to include a very complicated thing into a game with a very limited toolset. You don't have much mechanically to work with in the *World games and I think that this undermines your intention.<br/><br/>To use your first example, that of expressing horror at finding your murdered teacher:<br/><br/>- 2 of the 6 options require a witness, but in this situation there needn't be one.<br/>- Harden your heart, I get 'removing a string' but removing any string seems arbitrary. Why - if I discover my teacher murdered by the Infernal - would I remove a string from a Ghoul who was entirely unconnected with the incident? Also I would say something like 'hard-hearted' was more commonly understood than 'flinty'.<br/>- Wall yourself away and Go numb, I don't understand the logic here. How does expressing horror remove conditions?<br/><br/>You talk about PTSD and stress related disorders, but this move seems too light, too easy to fix mechanically, to represent them.<br/><br/>There may well be an opportunity here to explore developing a different kind of 'aftermath' move or mechanic - something like PTSD that has a long lasting effect and that removes a portion of agency from the player.<br/><br/>For myself, under the current ruleset, I would want to get the player's buy-in that this was the kind of material that they wanted to explore (especially if it dealt with removing any player agency). Then, they could build it into their behaviour and I could build it into my Hard Moves.<br/> <br/>\n<blockquote>Gaze was always about wanting to have an intense scene of enlightened hedonism with no regard for the consequence. </blockquote>\nI'm confused. Are you meaning hedonism in the sense of self-indulgence?<br/>\n<blockquote>I always thought that Dark gets under-used in Monsterhearts games, and could use either more clarity, a more active formulaton, or some additional moves.</blockquote>\nI was cautious in using Gaze into the Abyss in my first session - even to the point of buying special 'dark dice' to remind people to use it. After that, though, I became a lot more comfortable using it and calling it as MC. As I say above, I find it a useful too to communicate with the players through the game as well to have PCs interacting without being in the same space. I use Gaze into the Abyss far more often than Hold Steady, for example.<br/>\n<blockquote>Part of me - correct me if I'm wrong about this Mcdaldno - feels as if Gaze was originally intended partly as a carthartic move. Or at least that would have been a viable interpretation of it. Under the base rules if someone broke down I would certainly say "Sounds like you're Gazing Into The Abyss".</blockquote>\nI don't see a cathartic effect. The base rules seem pretty clear: you gaze into the abyss, you have questions, it provides answers through visions. And as a hard move, the MC can herald the abyss and have the abyss reach out to start the conversation on its own.<br/><br/>As the MC you're looking out for people doing something broody and introspective, breaking down doesn't sound like that.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadmanshand" title="deadmanshand"><img alt="deadmanshand" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadmanshand">deadmanshand</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416510/#Comment_416510" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T15:04:24+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  3:04PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm at work right now so I cannot reply in full but I do not think you actually understand what the base Gaze Into The Abyss is supposed to be.

For a lot of people (especially those not familiar with said mining roots), seeking the light holds some heavy religious connotation, even if that isn't what the words originally were used for. I mean, if you google "swastika" you get all of its nice Buddhist peace symbology and history, but that doesn't mean that we don't think Nazi when we see it. Connotation is just as important as history.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416513/#Comment_416513" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T15:18:16+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  3:18PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm at work right now so I cannot reply in full but I do not think you actually understand what the base Gaze Into The Abyss is supposed to be.

What I had said was:\n<blockquote>It is often supernatural: witches and infernals setting up pentagrams in their bedrooms to summon forth demonic knowledge, fay convening with will o' wisps at the edge of the murky wood. It is often research-oriented: consulting occult tomes that are inexplicably lying around the school library, the infamous google montage. It is often navel-gazing: dropping ketamine in your basement, flipping through old photo albums while sobbing mascara all over your bedspread.</blockquote>\nI am glad you are replacing the move in your game with something that works better for you. "Seek the light" is a fine move. It is more research-oriented than "gaze into the abyss" with its wording ("information" instead of "visions," etc), but that is just fine. Roll with it!<br/><br/>But maybe stop telling other people they're wrong and they don't understand? There can be multiple understandings and interpretations. The move is intentionally cloudy in its definitions to allow for that. You opened the thread with a mention of your "issues ... that rise from my lack of knowledge of the genre," so when folks like EpistolaryRichard reach out and share with you <i><b>their</b></i> knowledge of the genre, it's going to be helpful to listen to them and believe that they know what's up.<br/><br/>Before going further with this thread, it might be useful to talk about genre &amp; source material. If you're unfamiliar with the genre, familiarity might breed a wider and richer understanding of the game.

I can see in this and other threads people being a little more liberal with usage of Gaze than I would. Through other discussions people have shared different thoughts about Shut Down, Turn On and Sex Moves. Some of other people's views I've taken onboard and adopted, others I've decided aren't for me. Everybody's game is their own and they can run it how they and their group like.

I agree that there are two skins that do not have overtly supernatural moves, but it's fundamentally a supernatural game so all the PCs should have a connection to an abyss of some description. At the very least, all skins can choose moves from other skins, showing that they all have supernatural potential. <br/>\n<blockquote>By the by... seek the light is not a religious term.

Before we get there, I know that the abyss also has religious connotations, but as you mention it is also well-known as a metaphor for looking into horror and for being a philosophical comment about monstrousness, which are both aligned with Monsterhearts' themes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416517/#Comment_416517" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T16:21:41+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  4:21PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I agree you needn't be psychic, but I really disagree that it's the "research move".

To quote from the guidelines:<br/>}} Blanket the world in darkness.<br/>}} Make monsters seem human.<br/>}} Make humans seem monstrous.<br/><br/>A "mundane" abyss speaks directly to that last.

Or Secretary.  And those were pre-existing perfectly mundane films - and I wasn't even trying to gaze into the abyss when I watched them.<br/><br/>And the gaze using the internet isn't just a google montage.  It's 4chan.  It's chatrooms you probably shouldn't be in, looking for information - and finding people.  It's seeking out the wierd and dark fringe of humanity and looking there for information.  Because those are the places you'll find what you need.  The nice safe areas - google, wikipedia, national newspapers won't find a thing.  But if it exists there is porn of it.

communicated to you that it is "the research move," and that this is somehow mutually exclusive with what EpistolaryRichard is saying, then I misspoke.</blockquote>\nIt is a research move as you have all described it. You do something and then learn something. I have not heard a single example where it did anything other than give information. That is from this thread and the links provided. If all of the supporting evidence supports my stance that it is a research move what conclusion must I come to?\n<blockquote>But maybe stop telling other people they're wrong and they don't understand? There can be multiple understandings and interpretations. The move is intentionally cloudy in its definitions to allow for that. You opened the thread with a mention of your "issues ... that rise from my lack of knowledge of the genre," so when folks like EpistolaryRichard reach out and share with you <i><b>their</b></i> knowledge of the genre, it's going to be helpful to listen to them and believe that they know what's up.<br/><br/>Before going further with this thread, it might be useful to talk about genre &amp; source material. If you're unfamiliar with the genre, familiarity might breed a wider and richer understanding of the game. I provide a solid mediography at the back of the book - have you taken any of it in yet?</blockquote>\nI told him I didn't think his version was correct. I still don't. He doesn't seem to care that I disagreed with him and I meant no disrespect in doing so. Just as I have not meant any disrespect in any of my disagreements here. It is my belief that the vagueness of the Move hurts it rather than enhances. Maybe that is not true for everyone here but I prefer my narrative style to be sharp. Concise. Focused. Vagueness in the mechanics muddies the process for my style.<br/><br/>I live by a maxim - <i>to each their own.</i> If he wants to use Gaze that way - awesome. If he doesn't think my interpretation is correct - cool. Being disagreed with is not a bad thing in my book. People disagree with me every day and some of them probably rightly so. As long as everybody is cool with how they are doing it that is all that matters. There is no wrong way to play a game.<br/><br/>I understand the Move to the extent that I need to if I play in another's game who uses it. My games will use my Moves. Neither are wrong. <br/><br/>Now on to knowledge of the genre... Epistolary mentioned nothing that I was not already aware of. I watched Buffy religiously as a teen. I have seen more than I really wanted to of Charmed. Angel ran hot and cold as a show. Much to my dismay I have seen every last Twilight movie - if only for the Rifftrax. And I don't believe any of his examples actually count as Gazing Into The Abyss. Buffy's visions were involuntary and happened at random. No intent or special action or state of mind necessary. Same for Charmed and Angel. Only Twilight might count because the characters are always moping and brooding but I really don't want to base anything i do ever in an rpg or life off of Twilight. <br/><br/>This - of course - is a matter of opinion. I simply don't seem them as that move.<br/><br/>I did look at the mediography after you posted. Many of the movies and shows I am unfamiliar with or know of but haven't watched. There are several that I know very well. I haven't played AW yet but I have played Vampire the Masquerade for the better part of 20 years. The Craft came to mind the moment I read the Witch. I saw Jennifer's Body but managed to block the movie from my mind thankfully. Let the Right One In is one of my favorite vampire movies of all time as is the Lost Boys. I've seen Buffy, Misfits, and the first season of Roswell.<br/><br/>Let me finish this by saying if I am coming off as hostile or dismissive you must forgive me. I am not meaning to. I am simply having a conversation but I am very direct. I truly mean no offense nor have I taken any offense. Maybe been mildly irritated earlier but never offended or hostile. Just very, very blunt.<br/><br/>And before anyone asks - yes I do actually talk this way. Only with more jokes because I don't have to write the tangent down face to face.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416537/#Comment_416537" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T20:24:11+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  8:24PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2013 8:26PM by Paul_T.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's what I was getting at above, when I mentioned that it's interested to think of the Gaze Into the Abyss move as a sort of Sanity Check: it describes a character's encounter with the beyond/supernatural/incomprehensible, and whether the character manages to make sense of it and glean something useful or loses something in the process.<br/><br/>I think Joe's list of three elements in his last post (above) is the best possible guide: you're either engaging in some supernatural vision quest, seeking for information on something you're completely unprepared for or unfamiliar with, or engaging in some kind of hedonistic, personal pursuit to escape reality. <br/><br/>What all three have in common is that they're some form of relatively anti-social*, personal <i>ritualistic activity</i>: it's the attention of the self turned inward through some form of ritual. You may learn something new, or you may lose a bit of yourself in the process.<br/><br/>That's a very helpful list, I think. (Thanks, Joe!)<br/><br/><br/>*: You could do it in a group, yes, but ultimately the goal is always to lose yourself in it.<br/><br/>[Edit: cross-posted with deadmanshand, above.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416538/#Comment_416538" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-17T20:28:29+00:00" title="June 17, 2013  8:28PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/EpistolaryRichard">@EpistolaryRichard</a>,<br/><br/>It sounds like you've learned, over time, to trigger gazing into the abyss as an MC move.

I think it limits a move to categorise it by <b><i>type</i></b>. Since Vx started muddling about with the framework of moves I loved the idea of the narrative maxim that 'to do it, you do it'.

I haven't played Monsterhearts yet; I got it from a recent Bundle of Holding. When I read "Gaze into the Abyss", I think of Dante's "Divine Comedy", especially the start of it, and "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here".<br/><br/>The way I understand it is that yes, it is a research move, because using it increases the body of knowledge available to a character (although that knowledge doesn't necessarily have to be easy to interpret). However, the name conveys to me that this knowledge comes from the Abyss, and is gained by gazing into the Abyss (the Abyss being defined appropriately to a character). Consequently, both the method of research and its results should be tainted, and this taint should then hopefully spread onto the character doing the research. Monsterhearts is (partly) a horror game, and this is a horror research move. Anything non-horrific I'd either say yes to, or solve in a different way.<br/><br/>So just googling for info isn't enough; you have to google unhealthy topics and you end up on websites where people answer your chat and describe you as if they were watching you right now. If trying to find out whether someone likes you or hates you, you won't end up with a snarky post on Facebook; instead you'll find evidence of them tearing apart a poppet dipped in blood (the poppet being adorned with your stuff they absolutely should not have had access to, as it was locked in your secret drawer).<br/><br/>Does this make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadmanshand" title="deadmanshand"><img alt="deadmanshand" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadmanshand">deadmanshand</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416574/#Comment_416574" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-18T07:28:51+00:00" title="June 18, 2013  7:28AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Maybe MH (or other *word games) aren't the games for you?

Let me make sure that I understand you correctly. Because I want to use my own style while running this game I should play other games? Or that if I don't care for the original Gaze I don't want a "rich tapestry" of roleplaying experiences? Because if that is honestly what you meant to say then it is pretty much a direct attack upon me for wanting to put my own stamp on a game I am running. <br/><br/>Every GM makes adjustments to a game to better suit their style of storytelling and the kind of game they want. I don't want a Move that has a trigger of "You seem to be brooding or listening to music or smoking a joint... so are you Gazing Into The Abyss?" I don't want to encourage scenes like that in my game and I wanted something more focused than that. I wanted an active Move that could provide guidance that had different thematic triggers. For my games and my style of doing things.<br/><br/>If you and the others really enjoy the Move and what it brings - great. Those are your games and your characters. Don't attack me because I don't.

I'd love to hear more about that!<br/><br/>What does it typically look like, in play? What makes you decide when a good moment for it might be? Are there certain player actions which invite it, or do you pick moments which suit your agenda as the MC, instead? <br/><br/>What kind of information do you find it helpful to exchange, whether MC-to-player, or the other way around? Thinking of Gaze as a meta-communication tool is interesting stuff, I think.<br/><br/>When you do so, do you ask the player to roll the dice, or do you just bring on the visions as an MC move?</blockquote>\nI would definitely like to hear more about this as well, and how to cultivate this at the table. I would suggest, though, that this is less triggering the move as an MC move, rather just being alert as an MC as to when the narrative is triggering the player move. As it says in the Gaze move description:\n<blockquote><br/>The MC should always be listening for a PC to do something brooding and introspective, so that they can spring forth with the question, \u201cSo, does that mean you\u2019re gazing into the abyss?\u201d<br/></blockquote>\nAs to Gaze being a research move, I think it is more appropriate to think of it as an <i>exposition</i> move. What is revealed is often not what the characters are looking for, but it is always an opportunity to show or grow the world and entanglements.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_416604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416604/#Comment_416604" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-18T16:06:24+00:00" title="June 18, 2013  4:06PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wasn't trying to insult you, so please accept my apology.

These are for my game to facilitate my style of play. I don't want scenes of people brooding out in the woods so I re-write the move to have different thematic triggers. All I am doing is writing down my preferred brush strokes as it were. \n<blockquote>I wasn't trying to insult you, so please accept my apology. I wasn't attacking you at all.

It just came off as harsh but if you say it was not then I will believe you.<br/><br/>I enjoy the game thematically and mechanically - though I have run into issues with some of the players around my parts. No it is the Move itself that bothers me. It's vagueness and ill defined nature and purpose work against it's use in game.

Bella's been missing Edward and now she's going on her first date with Jacob. She ends up hanging out with some bikers and the danger in the situation ends up psychically connecting her with Edward.<br/><br/>I can easily see a player in my game saying "I totally miss Edward but there's no way I can ever see him again. What the hell am I supposed to do?" A Gaze into the Abyss move would give her clear visions of Edward and tell her what she has to do to make the visions continue (keep putting herself into danger).<br/><br/>But I was profoundly influenced by the text about Gaze into the Abyss that Joe cut from the playtest draft (that Paul linked to earlier):\n<blockquote>there\u2019s this thing called the abyss. you know where to find it. it knows where to find you.<br/><br/>it\u2019s the shit that\u2019s too awful to wholly exist. it\u2019s where kids get their nightmares, and schizophrenics get their delusions. it\u2019s where monsters get their power. the abyss can make offers, and demands. it can cast visions and prophecies. but without you, the abyss is weak. it needs a partner with which to tango. your relationship to the abyss is your own. like a terrible mirror, everyone sees something different.</blockquote>\n[<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/17927/joe-mcdaldno-writing-monsterhearts#Item_26" rel="nofollow">Paul's link from earlier</a> ]<br/><br/>Thinking about the Abyss as something that's out there, that wants to make contact with the characters, and wants them to fall into their Darkest Selves totally informs ever time I run the game. It makes me very willing to let players trigger the Gaze into the Abyss move on the flimsiest of pretexts because I love the momentum that it adds to the game.<br/><br/>The key for me, though, is what Joe wrote (in the playtest draft) here:\n<blockquote>each Skin has a different sort of relationship with the abyss. some of this is hard-coded into the options fo reach Skin, but a lot of it is left open to interpretation. ask about it. ask, \u201cso, how do your kind deal with abyss? is it responsible for the way you are?\u201d ask leading questions, and let the answers imply a sprawling mythology about the world. <br/></blockquote>\nSo for the Mortal in my current game the Gaze into the Abyss move is triggered a lot by her looking deeply into the eyes of the people she's meeting in this strange town she's just moved to. The Ghost has a fractured memory of her death and doesn't exist in an-entirely-linear timeline, so for her Gazing into the Abyss is like recovering memories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_416625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/416625/#Comment_416625" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-19T01:06:46+00:00" title="June 19, 2013  1:06AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>As an example, there's a 20 minute section of the Twilight: New Moon movie that I really like.
