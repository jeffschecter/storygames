<p>I was in my hotel in Atlanta this morning, shaving in front of the mirror and pondering over D&amp;D.  I was thinking about how I'm often dissapointed with the magic of the system &amp; setting, just because it's so pervasive.  I was thinking about how the magic looses it's luster when everyone and their brother has a +1 short sword, and you're not possibly cool 'till you hit +3 or better.</p>
<p>Then it hit me...</p>
<p>In the 3.0 and 3.5 versions of D&amp;D, anyone with a better than average intelligence and a few years of study can manufacture magic items.  Staying strictly by the book, with very few exceptions, the manufacture and use of magic items is reliable and predictible.  It's effects are repeatable, testable, and measurable.  Damn!  That's not <em>magic</em>, that's <em>science</em>!</p>
<p>One could argue that the Divine Magic of D&amp;D remains magical and not technological, because it's defined as originating from a diety.  But that just doesn't hold true for any of the wizardry bits.  I suppose you could argue that, in the Forgotten Realms setting, it was Mystra who supports the Weave for all those wizard-guys, and therefore it's supernatural, but that line of logic would also support the claim that gasoline makes cars go fast because the god of fast-things put the oil in the earth for us to refine.</p>
<p>Oh yeah!  D&amp;D Magic = Science, baby!</p>

                            I think you need to suspend disbelief a little there Eric, because that line of reasoning, taken to its logical conclusion, completely demolishes all the hard-wired fantasy tropes.  <br/><br/>Who will use lightning to smite enemies when it is such a bitchin' way to recharge Leyden jars?  What do you base your economy on when transmutation is an everyday chore?  Swords look quaint when you can mass produce fireball guns.  Muscle power &lt; levitation.  And so on.<br/><br/>Or did I miss the point?                        </div>

                            I don't know, that seems to really stretch the 'conventional' definitions of both magic and science.  Think about the magic item in D&amp;D--it doesn't just cost money and stuff to make, but a little piece of your soul (mechanically--experience points).  <br/>
<br/>
That soul sucking element should make the whole deal quite a bit less replicable--unless you are regularly engaging in death defying feats, you just don't have the 'soul' to spend creating magic items.  An 'average' crafter isn't going to have more than a minor magic item or two in them.  That doesn't seem very techy and replicable, except in the most abstract use of the terms.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, that does beg the question as to why there are so many danged magic items...Eberron had a nice idea with the magewright and artificers getting craft points, but that only pushes back the question a little. <br/>
<br/>
*sigh* (I'm just going to keep telling myself it's a game and I can let that go.  Inhaling tranquility, exhaling disbelief, inhale, exhale...I will not create a new item creation mechanic...)                        </div>

                            I dunno.  Just because something isn't mass producable, that doesn't make it magic (unless you want to say creativity itself is magic, which is a bit poetic for this discussion I think).  <br/>
<br/>
How many products of technology (engineering, physics) exist in our world that could only be made once or rarely, which more or less killed the person or person's who created them?  Some great mathematical theory, a great work of art, a giant building project, some brilliant invention. <br/>
<br/>
Dedicating or sacrificing many years, marriages, friendships, health, personal fortune, etc to a project is close enough to XP for me.                        </div>

                            I had the opposite reaction to the epiphany, which is "Ah, yes, I remember when I came up with that too...1988, a good year for me, kissed a girl behind the temporary classrooms, drove to my dad's work at the community college every night...good times, good times..."  I don't think anyone who's played D&amp;D extensively hasn't thought of a magitech setting for it, and, indeed, magitech-type stuff has made its way into many, many supplements over the years, from continual light globes as streetlights in big Forgotten Realms cities, to Eberron's lightning trains.<br/>

You can get a lot more cool ideas for magic-as-technology from anime (and their adjunct, Japanese console RPG) sources as well, concerned as so many are with the impact and implications of technology.                        </div>

                            Eric, yeah, magic and technology function almost identically in most stories.  That's why a lot of science fiction is properly a flavor of fantasy.  After all, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."                        </div>

<p>Actually, I feel like D&amp;D is strongly resistant to changing the social situation by the presence of magic. Magicians can make lots of things, but in the world of everyday life, precious few of them (wands of Tenser's Floating Disc?) actually matter.</p>

<br/>
:)  I only got into D&amp;D 3.5e a few months ago, prepping it for a Medieval Europe style game.  I really wanted to preserve the feel of Thirteenth Century Europe, and worried that high-power might completely skew everything.  <br/>
<br/>
But after looking at the "arcane" spells, I was flabbergasted that magic would have almost zero application to everyday life.  Having a wizard around might be handy, but even high-level wizards aren't very useful.  It's all tactical combat, with incidental application.<br/>
<br/>
Caveat: I stopped looking at spells higher than 6th level, and concede that some "divine" spells would make a very big difference both in every day life, and in the larger culture.                        </div>

                            Hi there, welcome to ancient Rome, where poisoning is such a common form of murder that Cicero mentions it specifically in his speeches in the first century.  Professional poisoners such as "the sisters" Canidia, Martina and Locusta were famous. Many emperors (Vitellius, Domitian, Hadrian, etc.) and dozens less conspicuous nobles were poisoned on a regular basis. It got so crazy that Juvenal put in one of his satires that you really weren't anyone important unless someone had poisoned you.<br/>
<br/>
But now we have the 0th level spell Detect Poison...<br/>
<br/>
(Heck, we even have the 0th level spell Resistance, which will let the poisoners do their work with a little more skill and a little less worry about accidentally poisoning themselves...)<br/>
<br/>
Hello, by the way, and welcome to the ancient theater!  You know, we perform out here in the sunlight and daylight even for night-time scenes, and carry unlit lanters on stage to indicate it's night...<br/>
<br/>
But now we've got this 0th level Light spell..<br/>
<br/>
(What's more, we used to have to content ourselves with sounds made by people, imitators of wildlife and so on...now, with those great 0th level spell Ghost Sound, we can have wolves howling at the heels of our heroes, we can have the wind rushing past their mountaintop retreats...)<br/>

Hi, welcome to the pre-industrial age, where fixing machinery is a complicated and difficult task usually done wrong because of the lack of widespread education. We can't have very complicated locks on rivers, bridges, or simple pressure-driven locomotion in any great quantity not because we don't know how to make them but because it's so very costly to keep them running...<br/>
<br/>
At least until we learned this 0th level Mending spell.<br/>
<br/>
And man, if you can't make money with Prestidigitation, you haven't even HEARD of Las Vegas...<br/>
<br/>
And that's just 0th level spells...<br/>
<br/>
And that's just arcane spells...                        </div>

<p>Although some implimentations of the D&amp;D world may not have applied magic to the everyday world, there have certainly been attempts in <em>Dragon</em> articles and various products. Stones with Continual Light cast on them should be pretty common, at least for non-peasants. Various books have talked about how to create a private room in a world where scrying is common. There was one very early article about Merchant cantrips to check for counterfeit coins or create an alarm for their shop.</p>
<p>But to me the most science fictional aspect of D&amp;D is the way all the spells and magical beasts seem to have mechanistic explanations on how they work. Instead of just having a spell that makes things vanish, you have ithe vanish spell moving things into the ethereal plane. The various planes are used as explanations for loads of other effects, too  Monster entries talk about how the animal reproduces, as if this is necessary to know for monsters.</p>
<p>Plus, things get science fictional names in some cases instead of down-to-earth names more in keeping with a pseudomedieval setting. We have telepathy and ESP spells, instead of "Hear Thoughts"; we have pyrotechnics; we have teleportation.</p>

The problem with that is that the duration for most of the low-level spells is short enough to make them pretty useless on daily-life timescale, but very useful on a dungeon-crawl timescale. <br/>
<br/>
For example, Light lasts 10 minutes/level, so unless your theater has a 12th+ level mage on hand, every single light source in the theater is going to need renewing two or three times over the course of an evening. That's a lot of Light spells. You could get some Continual Flames, but they're 50gp a pop plus labor cost of a level 3+ Mage, which is non-trivial.<br/>
<br/>
Scanning the arcane spell list, a much smaller proportion of 1st-4th-level spells would be useful outside of a dungeon-crawl/artillery context, even ignoring issues of duration. A D&amp;D wizard trying to make his way in the world without Adventuring will probably be doing the majority of his casting from that 0th-level list. In fact, I would posit that the only real reason why so many 0th-level spells seem to have broader applications is because their dungeoneering applications are pretty limited and small in scope.                        </div>

                            Pff, a 1st level adept can cook off a 10 minute light spell 3 times a day (4 if they don't cast any first level spells). For a nice 2 hour performance, all you need is four of them.  Looking at the rules, you can expect to see that in any settlement of more than 800 people. You wouldn't see any large-scale theatrics in a settlement below that size anyway, probably! And don't forget that in bog-standard D&amp;D there can be cities of populations reaching a million.<br/>
<br/>
Even a short duration spell is sometimes better than a long, tedious mundane method.<br/>
<br/>
Mending is instantaneous. As opposed to sending for an engineer, which could take months.<br/>
<br/>
Let's shift the goalposts a bit. Are not approximately the same, or larger, percentage of spells in other d20 fantasy supplements useful outside of combat? Even assuming my EXTREMELY limited reading of an extremely narrow portion of the spells on the list, it looks like we could be looking at vast changes.  If we incorporated some third party supplement, that could mutliply dramatically. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, let's shift the goalposts further. Is not combat a big piece of many real-world cultures' lives? Think about a hunter-gatherer civilization with True Strike (a first-level spell), now think of one without it.                        </div>

<p>JD,</p>
<p>Previous versions of AD&amp;D were somewhat more concerned with, uh, the "reality" of the mileau. This is one of the major changes in 3.5. Note that stones of <em>continual light</em> are a thing of the past, and many spell durations have been shortened, which assumes you were only using them in combat anyway. This is an intentional shift in the focus of the gameplay, and for the better. Also intentional: the divorce of appropriate technology or society from any historical counterpart.</p>
<p>Let's <em>not</em> think about such-and-such civilization unless it exists inside the context of a particular game that somebody's playing.</p>
<p>I totally get what Ben is talking about with "mass-murders."</p>
<p>Talyman raises probably the best argument for calling D&amp;D sci-fi, or at least "not fantasy." There's something very non-magical about a predefined set of spells which operate on very deterministic principles. Pretty out-of-genre for fantasy.</p>
<p>So, uh, yeah, I pretty much concede to Eric's original point. If magic were reliable, predictable, and non-mysterious, we'd call it science.</p>

Understand I'm writing from a place of loving D&amp;D a ton.<br/>

But it's basically very hard to advance to any significant level without doing some killing of sentient creatures.  I imagine those who are willing to do that (for reasons of conscience or personal safety) are pretty rare.<br/>

                            I don't think that's true for NPCs, who will always make up the most significant part of society, and that's what we're talking about - after all, 91 percent of society is commoners.  NPCs don't follow the same level advancement schema as PCs, if they did it would be ludicrous. No, NPCs levels come from an entirely different concern than PC levels.  What you say is only true for the "adventuring" class characters such as the PCs are assumed to be - they are also assumed and game mechanically directed to be outliers (at the very least) in the demographic scheme of things. So no. Still untrue. And I haven't even started moving the goalposts yet with the alternate advancement systems given in the DMG. So let's just agree to disagree.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, I am a practical guy. I am of the view that deciding "I don't like XP for mass murder, thus I won't give out XP for mass murder" is no different from deciding "I am going to play a rogue this time...and he is going to be rad."<br/>
<br/>
And perhaps a thread for another time is why you felt the need to preface your remark with the statement that you love D&amp;D a ton...and why others didn't. (Including myself.)                        </div>

<p><em>Me?</em></p>
<p>Why would I want to stop this?  This is awesome.  That's one of my favorite things about D&amp;D; You can go out and say pretty much <em>anything</em> about it and a dozen people are guaranteed to jump up and shout about what you said.  Agreement, disagreement, twelve-page essay about the socio-policitical state that must certainly erupt from an excessive use of spells that summon food... it's fucking awesome.</p>
<p>Please continue.</p>
<p>Or, better yet, lemmie stoke this here fire...</p>
<p>I no longer feel that the XP requirement is something that would prevent D&amp;D magic from being defined as technology.</p>
<p>XP in D&amp;D 3.x comes from <em>overcoming challenges</em>, which include, but are not exclusive to, murder.  In fact, the chapter "NPCs in the Community" on p.p. 139-140 of the 3.0 DMG presents us with the idea that a Small Town will have a minimum of one 4th-level Commoner, while a Small City would have a minimum of two 10th-level Commoners.  Now, you may read this as meaning that the commoners have plenty of Dire Chickens to combat, thus raising their ability to do um... common things (that's what commoners do, right?).  Therefore, I assume that these commoners are coming to their levels by means of overcoming challenges other than the gizzard-eating variety.  Furthermore, I posit that the larger the community, the greater the challenges a Commoner has to overcome.</p>
<p>So, with the idea firmly in hand that XP for NPCs must totally be available by means other than mass murder, let's take a look at the XP requirement to achieve 10th level.  That's 45,000 XP!  Plenty enough to spare.  I mean, WTF is a Commoner gonna use them for anyway??</p>
<p>Ok, so Commoners make up, like 91% of the population at 1st level, right?  Sure, that's what p 140 in the DMG says.  But!  In that Small City, what's to keep that up &amp; coming commoner from taking a single level in Wizard?  Money?  Well, a 2nd level NPC has 2,000 GP worth of <em>something</em> to sell.  What else?  Time?  Well, according to the PHB 3.0, p 93, a human Wizard's age is 15+2d6 years.  If we assume the worst possible luck that's 12 years of school.  So, damn!  What were talking about here is <em>highschool</em>.  Ok, ok, if we assume that there's work, maybe apprenticeship built into the 15 years, then maybe we're talking about a Master's Degree.  I can go with that.  What else?  You can cast spells of a level equal to your INT-10.  So, if yer a bit thick-headed, no Wizardry for you.  But, fuck, if you beat out the other 99% of Commoners out there to make it to 2nd level, then you're probably at least a half-point above average human intelligence.  An 11, let's say.  That's good enough to cast 1st level spells + Cantrips.</p>
<p>So, what keeps a Commoner from being a wizard?  A little luck, some cash, and lots of devotion.  Doesn't sound any different from trying to become a scientist to me.  Just because 91% of the population is content to live in a shack and farm dirt doesn't make the sciense any less of a science.  Demographics have nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>Wait!  Commoners can't use Scrolls!  Well, shit, just because a hillbilly can't use a technical manual doesn't mean that it isn't technical.  There are -potions-, you know....</p>
<p>Let's look at potions and our Hillbilly turned Devry Graduate... er... Commoner turned Wizard.</p>
<p>Our recent graduate can brew potions at 3rd level, so, he's got some work to do before he can get onto his mass-production workshop.  But, there's at least a couple 7th level wizards around.  Maybe even as good as a 10th level wizard!  Oh yeah, there's totally already a market here in Small Cityville for some low-level wizards.  Hell, there's gotta be a guild, right?  So there's his stack-o challenges to bring him up to 5th level (2 COM + 3 WIZ).  Cuz guild-rivalries totally produce challenges.  Like trying to get the dirt on the other guild to make sure that your guild gets the new Detect Poision contracts for that merchant caravan.  Usual stuff for the world, but totally challenging.</p>
<p>Right, so now we've got our dude set up to manufacture potions, right?  He's gonna make bank off of manufacturing Detect Poision potions.  You know how it goes, you're an important magistrate, you're eating with some people who may want you dead, if you're feeling ill after dinner it'd be nice to have a potion to determine if you're poisioned, or just got a bit of gas.  It doesn't matter what level Detect Poision is cast at, so the DeVry grad can totally cast it at 1st level.  A 0-level spell, cast at 1st level, costs 1 XP (pg 80, PHB 3.0).  So, if he overcame just one 1st level challenge every year, even as part of a 4-person 5-th level party... he'd have 300 XP to play with.  That's a potion a day, taking two months vacation off to travel somewhere warm in the winter (which he'll be able to afford to do, with all that extra GP you'll have floating around).  Heck!  If he takes up some dangerous rock climbing during his two-month vacation, BANG!  There's his 300-XP <em>inspiration</em> for another year's worth of cranking out Cantrip potions.  Dang, he rocks.</p>
<p>So, not only is the amount of mass-production a moot point (it doesn't matter how many rockets you can make in a year, it's <em>not magic</em>), but also a non-issue.  Anyone in the D&amp;D world with the time, devotion, luck, and half-a-brain necessary to become a wizard can mass-produce items of 'magic' which are reliable, repeatable, and have effects that are measurable.</p>
<p>That is so technology.</p>

                            Actually, despite some very detailed religious stuff to plunder from, very rarely is there a good depiction of conservative or reactionary religion without making it a caricature in most d20 stuff...<br/>
<br/>
I'm actually a little dissatisfied with the religious stuff done in most D&amp;D supplements - I don't know why, maybe it's because in your typical Canadian, whoops, I mean Forgotten Realmsian pantheon, there's never really all that much at stake. <br/>
<br/>
That's one reason I like City of the Spider Queen, in which your high level PCs must basically take on a crazed demigoddess with an actual, concrete, "I will do X, then Y, then Z, and nobody better fucking get in my way" agenda.                        </div>

                            Hmmm, I tend to assume that those 10th level commoners are also old--namely, that they have just been around long enough to nickel and dime their way to the top.  You have to have a real hotbed of challenges to keep a steep xp curve up--about a dozen a level equal to yours.  Beating out a rival for a contract is almost never 'at your level' unless there are some pretty fancy challenges wrapped up in them.<br/>
<br/>
One of the big ways to get non-combat xp is simply to engage in social challenges that would avoid a combat situation--which means, again, tons of xp are off the table.  Also remember that you can only burn xp down to the bottom of your current level, which means if you do a lot of regular item creation, you simply don't level.<br/>
<br/>
As for whether that alone disqualifies the tech talk...well, there is a lot of semantics that needs to be taken care of.  If you think of magic as defined by its non-reproducibility, you will have some tough problems discussing magic in places like Le Mort d'Arthur--where it is explicitly and frequently linked to craft.  <br/>
<br/>
The line here is blurry in our vocabulary, but I tend to start calling things science when the results are a property of the objects and not their makers.  In other words, not just any schmoe can add three drops of wolfsbane to ivy and get a potion of dog itchiness.  The same cannot be said of chemistry.  It isn't possible to mechanize D&amp;D magic--you need a soul of sorts to invest in the object.  My robot mixes wolfsbane and ivy and just gets a salad, not a magic item.<br/>

                            Eric is essentially correct - magic in a by-the-books D&amp;D campaign is at least quasi-scientific.  From the OED, science is defined as:<br/><br/><i>A branch of study which is concerned either with a connected body of demonstrated truths or with observed facts systematically classified and more or less colligated by being brought under general laws, and which includes trustworthy methods for the discovery of new truth within its own domain.</i><br/><br/>You can quibble about whether spells and their ingredients are 'trustworthy', and whether new research will proceed obviously from extant spells - but the framework is pretty much there.  Magic can be taught to anyone with the requisite intelligence, the effects of spells can be altered with relative precision, and so on.  It doesn't matter that there's a 'soul' involved - because the soul is a very knowable (and therefore fungible and scientifically accessible) quantity in D&amp;D.  Hell - even things such as morality are concrete.<br/><br/>However, just because magic is quasi-scientific doesn't make D&amp;D a sci-fi game.  The impact of magic on society is very rarely discussed and haphazardly applied to the game world.  Even if magic is applicable to non-violent, non-adventuring ends, its not a focus of the game, or even a topic of discussion.                        </div>

<i>that wouldn't count as technology, it would be craft? </i><br/><br/>No--I'm not making a distinction between craft and technology (although I would), but assuming that the two have a lot in common (namely, repeatability).  Second, I'm noting that many canonical texts (including Medieval arthuriana) don't make a firm distinction between craft and magic.  So, if tech can be collapsed into craft based on repetition, then you have to say a lot of what defines magic ends up being technology.  <br/><br/>Craft defines a region of work that is repeatable but does not provide a 'built-in' ladder for the invention of new truths (which science and its ancilla technology do).  A shelfmaker has a lot of know-how, but they don't have firm rules for the discovery of new truths.<br/><br/>As to the definition of science from Kuma--let's push the pseudo terminology hard.  Exactly how does magic (as stated in D&amp;D) secure any means for progress (discovery of new truth)?  There is nothing in the magic system that really secures a path for discovery and invention (or implies it exists in any robust sense of the term).  Even epic magic (the most 'innovative' for its spell creation) only allows you to mix ingredients, not discover new magical 'theorems.'  Innovation is so rare that it occurs as much by happenstance as intention.<br/><br/>--Ian                        </div>

                            The D&amp;D magic system, in my opinion, always seemed far less "magical" and much more "Sears catalogue".<br/>

It's a system with clearly defined cause-and-effect, structured in such a way that magic feels like a commoditised technology.<br/>

Be it magic items, spells or what-not, all can be bought in a world where hyperinflation is yet to be invented.                        </div>

<br/>
The thing that makes it not science fiction is what Larry said: it "can't be used in any industrial capacity". That is, despite its implementation being essentially naturalistic (and therefore subject to comprehensible natural laws), it has no effect on its society. It's a good example of D&amp;D's strategy game essence.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, it also points out how little D&amp;D has to do with the epics, Tolkein, Vance, LeGuin, or any of those respectable fonts of fantasy. It's a strategy game with fantasy color. My understanding is that 3.5 fixes the brokenness of its strategy  game essence by giving the GM some rules about how to build an adventure, decreasing the effects of the conflict of interest that mar its design otherwise. But those came at the cost of the "role playing" parts that many folks like so much.<br/>
<br/>
Science fiction is a way to address premise. Since D&amp;D doesn't help you address premise (and its color is almost totally ignorant of premise anyway), it's not science fiction.                        </div>

<p>Okey dokey... There's a thread not too far from here that's all about discussing what SciFi is and isn't.  If anyone disagrees with anyone else's interpretation of what SciFi is, then let's go over there with it.  This thread was just supposed to be a tongue-in-cheek observation about how <em>not magical</em> the magic system of D&amp;D is.  For here, let's stick with that, kk?</p>

                            So here's a question - is it possible to have a magic system for a game that really seems magical? It seems to me that a fundamental problem is that a game needs rules, or at least "system," for magic, and that codification of magic renders it less magical.<br/>
<br/>
In one sense, I find D&amp;D magic more magical than Cold Iron magic because Cold Iron perhaps over systemized the magic (and threw in formulas with scary, scientific looking, things like logarithms).<br/>
<br/>
Now as a GM, I have come to prefer "fantasy" games to SF games, mostly because as GM, I can introduce funky stuff just "because," which makes the fantasy aspect more real. But unfortunately the players in GMful games usually don't have the same power.<br/>

<p>Frank, I think it's possible!</p>
<p>One way to accomplish this might be to strictly define what's going on at any given moment, such that you know certain entities <em>can't</em> substantially affect that situation using normal means, and give them mechanical tools to affect the situation anyway. Clearly, they must be doing magic! (i.e., Hello Kitty and Pochacco are otherwise alone in a doorless, windowless room. Yet Badtz Maru can interact with them mechanically. How?)</p>
<p>Probably there are other ways to make magical-seeming-magic; this is just one that's in my head because I used it recently.</p>

<blockquote>So here's a question - is it possible to have a magic system for a game that really seems magical? It seems to me that a fundamental problem is that a game needs rules, or at least "system," for magic, and that codification of magic renders it less magical.</blockquote>
There was a <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=14536.0" rel="nofollow">Forge thread</a> on that topic a while ago.  I think the consensus was that if magic is supposed to evoke wonder, then the necessity to systematize it in a game prevents such evocation, and so the problem is a tough one.  But other ways of thinking about magic might get around the problem.  For example, if magical effectiveness depended on one's ability (as a player) to invoke symbolic correspondences between one's own actions and the effects that one desired, then you might get something that felt magical but could still be systematic.  Chris Lehrich's <i>Shadows in the Fog</i> e.g. uses the Tarot to do something like that.                        </div>

                            There are those who say that magic only seems mysterious and "magical" because we don't understand it.  To one who is a practitioner, it is indeed just another tool for making changes in the world.<br/>

So if you want magic to seem magical... play a nonmagical character and don't read the magic rules.                        </div>

                            In Vance's Dying Earth + Eyes of the Overworld, the strongest original inspiration for D&amp;D's magic system, the power is primarily in the words/symbols of the spell, not in the caster. It's strongly hinted that magic is actually a form of mathematics. <br/>

I've always liked this notion (which supports the science/ tech thesis of the thread.) Of course with divine magic and inherent sorcery mixed in the premise gets diluted                        </div>

                            OK, dig, here's what I think one should do. This is material for Absinthe, but it's abstract, so it's probably applicable here.<br/>
<br/>
I like this definition: Magic is the process of using social rules on natural phenomena in order to have an acausal effect on a phenomenon.<br/>
<br/>
Piece by piece:<br/>
<br/>
Magic is a process. In that sense, it's gamable. Anyway, the point is, it's something you do.<br/>
<br/>
Social rules are rules that use things like words, gestures, bargains, names, and other symbols, as opposed to "I hit it and eat it" or 9.8m/sec/sec.<br/>
<br/>
Acausality is to differentiate it from our naturalistic viewpoint of the billiard ball universe. We've all felt this: you wish someone ill, (and maybe feel a little bad about it) and then something bad happens. You didn't do anything causal Ã¢â‚¬â€ you didn't crash their car, they did Ã¢â‚¬â€ but you feel guilty because you wished them ill. That's magical thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Effects means that something changes in the world. Magic without effects obviously doesn't need rules, but there are lots of schools of magic, particularly in the realm of theurgy, that are concerned with knowledge, as opposed to thaumaturgy, which is making stuff happen. Theurgic magic can be dealt with by whatever system you have in your game for determining cosmology. As soon as it has an effect Ã¢â‚¬â€ say, a demon tells you something you can't otherwise find out Ã¢â‚¬â€ it's thaumaturgy. You're performing miracles.<br/>
<br/>
Phenomena are the stuff that's tied into cause and effect. People, rocks, books, high school graduations, chimneys, oil changes, rain.<br/>
<br/>
So, starting from that perspective, imagine a magic system like the system in Polaris, where you're bargaining for stuff to happen until you can't take what the other person's going to say next. You lay out each of those things, then your opposition (another player) tells you what it will take to get that.<br/>
<br/>
VoilÃƒÂ¡! Magic is dangerous, with unpredictable results. You've negotiated with symbols the phenomena that take place in the world, unconnected by chain of events to your character (if you wish).                        </div>

<i>I like this definition: Magic is the process of using social rules on natural phenomena in order to have an acausal effect on a phenomenon.</i><br/><br/>Oooh, I like this quite a bit, Joshua.  It captures how orderly magic is for those who actually believe in it (hermetic or not) and provides a nifty frame for using it in a game without yet descending into the mechanics (which means that it can be ported about for different games.  As long as you keep 'social' broad enough, you get a really nifty result.                        </div>

<p>Damn. Looks like that Joshua AC Newman guy will also be cleaning house in the area of RPGs about magick. Somebody stop him!</p>
<p>I liked the general idea behind the <em>Mage: The Ascension</em> magic system, that magic which can be written off as a coincidence is easier to pull off than magic which blatantly violates the laws of "reality." That seemed properly magical. (I can't speak to how well this system was actually implemented in gameplay, however.)</p>

<p>The systematic nature of magic as well as the mysteriousness of magic can both vary a lot, depending on what kind of magic you need in your game. I like Joshua's suggestion for some kinds of magic, specifically the more shamanic, demonic, or religious kind: you've essentially got someone playing the role of the spirits you are trying to propitiate.</p>
<p>I've had a couple different magic systems, each for a different feel. Sometimes, I just want magic to be like any other action except for its description, so I just use a "magic" skill, maybe with a rule that it lets you do anything you could normally do, but violate one restriction, like "persuade someone, but without speaking" or "open that door, without touching it". Or, alternately, magic is a bonus effect to ordinary skills, if you roll an extra target number, or have unusual manifestations occur whenever specific numbers are rolled on the dice.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I want magic to be very subtle, sort of like "realistic" medieval magic instead of zaps and pows. So, I define a small number of bonuses or simple effects (heal, harm, change weather in next few days) you can potentially get from magic and have a requirement that magicians need to perform some kind of physical act that is symbolically linked to how they are applying the bonus.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I want magic that's more like super powers, maybe just a few kinds, like Glamour, Turn Ethereal, and Shapeshift. Everything a magician can do has to be done with that small list of powers.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I want a more mechanistic kind of magic, one with simple lists of components that you combine to create a wide variety of effects. In this case, I may link specific material elements, gestures, or behaviors to specific modifications of the base spell. This is a pretty standard Chinese Menu approach that you see in things like Ars Magica or GURPS Improvised Magic.</p>

<p>ACTION Joshua, I like your definition.</p>
<p>Conveniently, you can generalise it in a fairly elegant way, in order to broaden the effects you get out of it - Magic is the process of using the rules of one set of phenomena on another set of phenomena. So, you could for instance use CROPS/WEATHER:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has not rained for many days, so I fly kites with many metal hooks attached, to rake the sky.</li>
<li>The clouds are obscuring the sun, so I build a scarecrow out of water and fire to frighten them away.</li>

                            Shreyas, that's nifty and evocative.<br/>
<br/>
But are you doing it because you know it'll work from experience, because you understand the underlying principles and expect that it will work, or because you have faith it will work?<br/>
<br/>
The first is practice (aka craft), the second is theory (aka science), and the last is religion.  All three can be the basis of "magic" depending on the meaning of the word.<br/>
<br/>
Another meaning of magic that you find in some places boils down to psychic power; that one can awaken telekinesis, telepathy, precognition, etc. by performing certain rituals that cause a person's mind to enter an altered state of consciousness; the ritual does not cause the effect, but rather allows the magician to cause the effect directly from his will.                        </div>

                            Fred, find me a magician who doesn't speak in paradoxes and I'll show you a scientist. The point here is that there's no causal link between your desire and the eventual effect <i>from our naturalistic standpoint</i>. If I have a demon make someone's crops wither, the demon might be invisible and the bargain incomprehensible. But I wanted something to happen, and it happened, and my schÃƒÂ¤denfreude is enough to convince me that the demon wants me to pay something in return. But that doesn't mean I know the mechanisms by which it happened.<br/><br/>Shreyas, what you've done in both those instances is make a compelling symbol. Your raking example doesn't work like a normal rake, but it <i>looks</i> like a rake, and that's good enough Ã¢â‚¬â€ maybe better. Your scarecrow is actually interacting with the clouds like people, or at least animals.<br/><br/>Symbols that produce the effects of the things they represent to a conscious mind.                        </div>

<p>Well, let's look at this from a naturalistic standpoint:</p>
<p>This guy, let's call him Phil, he's a jerk to me. So I have this dream in which I punch him in the eye.</p>
<p>The next day, he gets in a car accident and gets a black eye.</p>
<p>I feel guilty about it: as far as I know, with my (very normal) magical thinking, I played some part in the outcome of hurting someone.</p>
<p>Training that kind of coincidence is the domain of the magician. When you "measure" those effects, you could do it scientifically (hypothesis, test, revision ...), or I can do it by other means (tell all my friends what happened, then they believe I can control things with my mind, then I believe it, then I notice the extraordinary coincidences that happen in my life and believe it myself).</p>
<p>So, let's say a particular culture believes that the world never changes. Everything's cyclic. Now, everyone knows that your ancestors were done wrong by my ancestors. Now, everyone knows it's time for payback: you've gotten into a good position politically, and it's put me in a bad position. Significantly, I believe that my ancestors did your ancestors wrong. So your wise man says my karma's due (or whatever our culture calls it) and proclaims it. Then my firstborn son gets pneumonia and dies. Obviously, it was karma, it was a supercausal (I don't like the term "supernatural") phenomenon.</p>
<p>(Except, of course, when we look back as naturalistic archaologists a millenium later, it turns out it wasn't my ancestors at all, but another family altogether with a similar name, and it turns out one of your allies poisoned my son without telling you.)</p>
<p>The fact that there <em>are</em> causal links has no effect on our belief that other phenomena were at work. If we examine it scientifically, we'll approach the facts of the situation. If we rely on magical thinking, we probably won't, but we'll sure figure out what the events <em>mean</em> to us.</p>

                            Just because you say the pneumonia was supercausal, doesn't mean it is.<br/>
<br/>
In a game, as players, someone around the table knows that the pneumonia was "caused" by SOMETHING.  It was either the karma, or the poison, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Are you suggesting that in order for in-game magic to feel mystical, that the players themselves must engage in magical thinking?  That seems to me to be a really, really hard thing to do, given that the dice/tokens/cards/whatever are right there on the table, and we KNOW what the true causes of the events in the game are.                        </div>

                            So much of this debate rests on what I think is a fundamental ambiguity in the language we have to talk about these things.  Dictionary definitions aside (remember, those are just extractions from actual use), terms like magic and science have very broad and fuzzy application.  This fuzziness is built in--at various points in their history, they shared the same turf, with varying degrees of civility.<br/>
<br/>
I like the rough and ready distinction between fact and meaning, but that goes to hell if we try very hard to deliver on it.  Science is all about meaning (what do these results *mean* not just look at these results) and magic is all about facts (Velma looked at me and I recently made fun of her pointy nose not just Velma gave me the evil eye which means I will get sick).  <br/>
<br/>
Both Magic and Science do these sorts of things: they provide us with a schema of things that qualify as meaningful (manipulatable) objects, they provide us with relationships between those objects, and even give us some idea of how we might incorporate (or reject) new objects into (or from) that system.  The idea that magic is inherently mysterious seems problematic--for most 'traditional' believers of magic, magic is no less mysterious than quarks (which is to say, superficially banal but amazingly mysterious in depth, once you scratch that surface).<br/>
<br/>
I don't know, it seems like the question of calling D&amp;D magic technology rests on the assumption that banality and transparency=technology whereas the distinctions at work are not so clear cut.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking--what would happen if we did say it was technology and see where that went?  I suspect it would start to feel a little silly and forced pretty quickly, partially because while it may push the definitions of magic, it mose definitely would screw with any expectations we have for a 'scifi' game.<br/>
<br/>
First and foremost--what the heck is the vehicle of causation for magic?  We don't have a clear causal chain that links the actions of a wizard to the effects of the spell.  We can describe what happens, but not why it happens (there isn't even pseudo-science 'ether' to work with).                        </div>

<p>The word "technology" comes from "techne", which means something like "craft," or "technique".</p>
<p>So a magical technology has to be <em>craftable</em>. That is, the results are predictable and a direct function of the mechanisms that go into them.</p>
<p>However, if you read older magical texts (Talmud being a good example), you see all <em>sorts</em> of stuff that are warnings without instruction. That is, the people involved directly, in the unlikely event that their behaviors didn't destroy them in some fundamental way, they were unable to communicate anything meaningful about the experience.</p>
<p>When your spells are "fireball" and "walk through walls", and it costs you x magic points to do it, that's a technology.</p>
<p>When you bargain for each of those with a person who knows what you want, well, maybe that's akin to statecraft, but it's sure far from blacksmithing or printing.</p>
<p>So, Fred, what I'm saying is that players should be drawing connections betweeen phenomena, so it's obvious to the players that thinking magically is the best way to a) get what you want and b) anticipate the costs. Because you're telling a story, something that the nonconscious world doesn't do. Only humans tell stories. Fortunately, you're playing with humans.</p>
<p>That the pneumonia has a naturalistic cause is irrelevant to our discussion here. Bronchial infection leading to mucus in the lungs isn't a story. A karmic grudge match is. Even given that the magic caused it, you're interacting with the world like it has a choice, like a person. But people make choices, unlike nonconscious phenomena. Arguing a rock uphill is magic. Pushing it is not. Even using a lever isn't.</p>

<p>That's interesting. Because I'm assuming that the causal relationship is variable and subject to the whim of whatever beings and sentient phenomena are involved. Since we're looking at a paradigm where humans and other beings have souls and are therefore not subject to causality (ignore the philosophical conundrum this causes Ã¢â‚¬â€ free will is a prerequisite concept for magic), <em>will</em> and <em>causality</em> are actually a duality.</p>
<p>JD: All stories address premise. Science Fiction is a particular way to do that. So is biography, history, magical realism, and the political thriller.</p>

Just to drive the nail into the coffin, 'real world' causation is simply perceived causation as well, since the actual mechanisms of most causation is unobservable and/or non-obvious.                        </div>

<p>Kuma, it's a good point. Nonetheless, what we see as causation is a reliably effective way of predicting phenomena in the world, where what I'm talking about is a system where natural forces act capriciously and out of will.</p>
<p>Of course, Hermetic magic evolved into today's science, so there's overlap, but I think we're talking about where there's not.</p>

<i>The word "technology" comes from "techne", which means something like "craft," or "technique"....When you bargain for each of those with a person who knows what you want, well, maybe that's akin to statecraft, but it's sure far from blacksmithing or printing.</i><br/><br/>Yeah, but if you want to go the etymology route, you find that the early uses of techne did not make a firm distinction between statecraft and blacksmithing.  Your Greeks (your platos, your aristotles) saw the two as intimately related.  Both depended on a knowledge (episteme) moved into an applied situation (the action being techne)--techne being the knowledge of situations, of applications.  Blacksmithing is as much 'negotiating' with the metal as statecraft is 'negotiating' with bureaucracy--a 'sense' of the matter being manipulated that allows the manipulator to extract a final result approximating their original idea.<br/><br/>I don't know if the magic talk is productively addressed from the question of techne vs. meaning...it seems that magic might be described as a symbolic techne (a means for incorporating objects into the socio-cosmological framework), without it ceasing to be magic.                        </div>

<p>"Negotiation" with the metal's a magical way of thinking about it. "Annealing and forging" are Naturalistic ways of thinking about it. I brought up the "technology" vs. "magic" concept to address Eric's original epiphany.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I've been thinking a lot about the world as software, where it's configuration of stuff, not the stuff itself (which is, after all, made up of quarks organized in a particular way Ã¢â‚¬â€ the organization itself defining the quarks) that makes the Universe real. This perspective might be a magical perspective, I dunno. In any event, a Universe made of information is certainly more subject to negotiation than a Universe made of things.</p>
<p>Fred, I'm convinced: causality's the wrong word; it reflects my Naturalistic, Modern mindset.  You're providing a cause, and there's an effect that's what you wanted. What I really mean is that there's no <em>scientifically reproduceable</em> chain of cause and effect. You are, by the very nature of your act, dealing with a sentient Universe that will deal with you differently next time, and will deal with other magicians differently than it did with you. It has motivations that are imperceivable to you.</p>

I know it is fairly popular among the superconductor set.  I think I may just kick off another thread--I for one am drifting far from the original thread topic.                        </div>
