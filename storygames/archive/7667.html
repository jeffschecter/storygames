It's got a similar RPG meets skirmish minis feel to D&amp;D, but a bit simpler and faster playing.  Things I like include:<br/><br/> - Easy tracking of mooks allow large fights to move quickly.<br/> - Explicit encouragement for players to handle allied NPCs in combat<br/> - Easy to hack/extend rules set<br/> - It's $10!<br/><br/>I'm surprised by the statement that their is not much character advancement.  You get to do the same "pump up and get cool new feats" thing as in D&amp;D, only a bit less detailed.

By default, character growth is pretty rapid, so you may want to tweak that if you want a longer period of "low level" play. But advancing to a point where you can lead your own personal army is also really fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170358/#Comment_170358" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-21T02:23:45+00:00" title="September 21, 2008  2:23AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran a year-long fantasy game with Savage Worlds, and had a lot of fun.  It takes a little getting used to, especially if you're expecting D&amp;D.  Things are a little more random, and sometimes it can feel like you're not getting anywhere in a fight (a weak damage roll can cause a palpable hit to have literally zero effect).  On the other hand, you can blow through huge combats in no time, you're not tied to using minis (though it's rewarding if you do), there's a much "flatter" power curve than D&amp;D, so low power characters are competent, and high-power characters are still vulnerable, and finally, you'll find prepping games much easier than most other similar games.  Character advancement is pretty solid.  We didn't find any horribly broken combinations, and players were still finding interesting routes for advancement after a year of weekly play.<br/><br/>Rafial made some good points too - players running their own allied NPCs lets you do things that are very hard in other games, like PCs as squad leaders and so on.  It's also a very easy game to hack, once you understand the way the rules work.  <br/><br/>One mechanic I don't entirely like is "bennies".  They're tokens that you get to spend to re-roll dice, soak damage, gaining XP, and a few other things.  While they work fine in that role, I found that in the long term, players tended to hoard them for soaking damage, or XP, rather than spending them on more interesting things.  The game encourages you (the GM) to hand out bennies for things you like, like "good roleplaying" and so on.  Some people really like that, but I really didn't (I don't like feeling like I'm judging my friends).  Lastly, the GM gets a few bennies to spend for NPCs, in the same way that players can.  In practice this made me a bit uncomfortable - it was really easy to hose a player in a vulnerable position if I felt like it, and it made the already tricky "GM fiat" issue of any unlimited GM game even more of a problem.  <br/><br/>On the whole, I'd say that Savage Worlds is one of the best examples of its genre - a fast, low-crunch, "traditional" generic system.  It has a pulp flavour, but is readily adapted to a wide variety of games.  You'll like it if you want a traditional game with more emphasis on getting things done than on getting them done exactly right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170362/#Comment_170362" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-21T05:56:33+00:00" title="September 21, 2008  5:56AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with the positive assessments (I think it delivers on its tag line "fast, fun, furious") and the concerns re bennies.  I love the ways they can be spent as currency but have a reaction similar to Simon's re: entirely handed out on a "to the GM's taste" basis.<br/><br/>About "hitting not being enough", oh yeah, had a PC taken out by a skeleton that he kept hitting but never damaging.<br/><br/>The different options for "weird science" and "faith" etc. approaches to magic etc. are also nice.  You could run a "conan" game in which there was no flashy magic etc.<br/><br/>It feels very much like old basic D&amp;D "updated right" (not mechanically but flavour wise).  It somehow combines feeling pulp action and a bit "gritty" at the same time.  And at $10 for a print copy, it's worth at least a peak if this sort of game is your thing.  <br/><br/>If 4e tanks for my table (who are very much trad-gamers as a group, none of this hippy dippy shared authority stuff or relationships as source of dice pool), this is what I plan to suggest we go to.  I briefly fantasized just printing up some fake covers for the $10 version and told them, "oh no, this is the 4th edition, they really did redesign it completely to play fast but still let you create lots of different characters - and they really dropped the price point too".<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi" title="Kobayashi"><img alt="Kobayashi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zadkin.free.fr/logoBaveuse2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi">Kobayashi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170366/#Comment_170366" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-21T08:08:53+00:00" title="September 21, 2008  8:08AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Why I love it ?</b><br/><br/>Simple yet solid rules that allow me to face unexpected cases not covered by the rules<br/><br/>Very simple to convert to (I wrote a Justifiers conversion to SW in one afternoon)<br/><br/>My players dig it (especially the Adventure deck, highly recommended !)<br/><br/>You don't have to use miniatures if you don't want to, without losing anything rules-wise.<br/><br/>Perfect for pulpy action (from Conan sword &amp; sorcery to Indiana Jones)<br/><br/>I found the Pinnacle boards to be extremely friendly and useful.<br/><br/><b>What I don't like</b><br/><br/>The damage system.

The most egregious - left over bennies = xp has been fixed in recent editions of the rules (xp is awarded separately). Here are some other ideas I think are better than the RAW:<br/><br/>1. You can hand out a set number of bennies per player per session and they either use them or lose them.<br/>2. Instead of assigning bennies to bad guys, just award the bennies you use for a bad guy to the player you use them against.<br/>3. Consider having the players put all their bennies in a common pool - anyone can use them provided everyone agrees and the gm pays to this pool when bad guys use bennies. The emergent behavior I've seen from this is increased teamwork, and a greater willingness to help each other be awesome.<br/><br/>Hope this helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MountZionRyan" title="MountZionRyan"><img alt="MountZionRyan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/426/nG1TIXTID71FS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MountZionRyan">MountZionRyan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170620/#Comment_170620" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T06:07:29+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  6:07AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just for the sake of balance.

It's one of my "go to games" when I want to run a simple action-y game quickly.<br/><br/>I joked once that I could create a character in under two minutes, to which my friend pulled out his watch and started counting. I realized he wasn't joking after about 8 seconds and began. I finished a complete human "Captain Mal" character, complete with equipment, and even referencing the book twice (flipping through it), in one minute and twenty seconds. <br/><br/>I've run mostly PEWPEWPEW SF and Fantasy (Conan style) with it, and yeah the original Bennies == XP thing was quickly houseruled out of existence. I think it has some real long-term campaign play legs, but I think over time you might see characters become a little too powerful after months of regular play (the longest campaign I played with it was about 4 months). <br/><br/>A few years ago, I picked up the book and put it down because I thought the focus on miniatures and "physical stats" and few mental/social stats crafted a game with little roleplay value. After playing it, I quickly changed my mind: It created that "fruitful void" thing I see brandied about, where the lightness of the system and quick handling made room for a lot of real solid roleplaying, more so than other generic systems that I've used. You don't have that effect much where something happens in a social situation, and then heads go to sheets looking for skills and the like they can use in this situation (something I saw a lot in GURPS, Fudge and the like); rather, roleplaying just emerges, since folks know that there's not much on their sheet that will help in non-physical situations so they don't rely on them.<br/><br/>And the minis/skirmish stuff is hella fun, too. <br/><br/>The only thing that I'd be careful of is armor. Even regular armor can cause for a lot of whiffing in combat. <br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_170650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170650/#Comment_170650" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T08:46:23+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  8:46AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am a massive fan.  So much so that I'm co-publishing a supplement under PEG's new license.  I'd genuinely say that it changed my gaming.<br/><br/>There's not much I can say about it that hasn't been said already in this thread, but to re-iterate the biggest points (from my POV):<br/><br/>What the game's like in play really doesn't come across from the text of the book.  I mean, the book does a fine job of telling you <i>how to play</i>, but not <i>what the experience of play is like</i>.  It's a clich\xe9, but you really have to actually play Savage Worlds to "get" it.<br/><br/>Minis are optional, but you're really not making the most of the tactical opportunities (and a lot of the fun that goes with that) if you're not using them.  I use a battle mat for encounters, it's made things way more fun and makes some of the edges genuinely useful and fun rather than ok.  For example, I'm currently playing in a Solomon Kane game that Claire's running and my character is a swordsman who has the First Strike and Lunge edges.  This is fun to play with, because lunge lets me hit people from one square further away than normal (ie, not next to them) and First Strike lets me attack anyone who gets next to me.  So I can now Lunge someone on my turn, then hit them again on their turn when they step up to hit me.  That's pretty neat.<br/><br/>The Bennies issue: Bad guys have them, it's a case of "the GM has <i>this much</i> fiat", which I personally like a lot.  Because it formalises fiat and the players know how much the bad guy can "cheat", as it were, they can plan for it.  We recently discussed this in my group: it was said that the NPC's bennies are basically the game's ablative "hit points" for major bad dudes.  The PCs wail on the boss man, the first few hits knock out his bennies and only when they're gone do your blows start doing real damage.<br/><br/>"It's like D&amp;D, but simpler and quicker" is not an entirely inaccurate statement.<br/><br/>Anyone who hasn't checked out Shaintar should do so if only for the Modular Adventure Creation System.  I fully intend to use that in my book (under license).  It's a cool-as setting too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170659/#Comment_170659" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T09:14:39+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  9:14AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rich Stokes</cite>Anyone who hasn't checked out Shaintar should do so if only for the Modular Adventure Creation System.</blockquote>\nCan you describe Shaintar's Modular thingy?<br/><br/>Also, yeah, I agree on "need to play it to get it".

The suit and value of the cards in the various positions act as a kind of situation generator.  The basic spread is just 4 cards in a cross, with the 4 directions meaning Who, What, Where and Why.  More complex spreads have a bigger, more complex meaning.  The idea is that it's a springboard for a stuck GM's imagination.  Keep putting cards on the table and expanding your spread until you have a germ of inspiration for the situation, then work out the details.<br/><br/>I really dig it as a way to shorten prep time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_170751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece" title="Brennen Reece"><img alt="Brennen Reece" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennen%20Reece">Brennen Reece</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/170751/#Comment_170751" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-23T14:20:21+00:00" title="September 23, 2008  2:20PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay.
