I need help in making a plot (I think).<br/><br/>I normally run fairly gritty/focused sandbox types games (yes, I love apocalypse world, matches me to a T). This time I had my players come to me with a request - they wanted to run a "Avengers style" epic game - they want some overall "plot" and bad guy etc.<br/><br/>Not my strongest area, but I started this game for them. First session actually went quite well - recovery of mysterious stolen property on a tight deadline. Midnight helicopter drops in the middle of Africa, mysterious soldiers and competing groups. Gunfights and rescuing prisoners. Explosions. Mysterious powerful thing <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Players loved it and are raring for the next session.. <br/><br/>...and I'm a little stumped.<br/><br/>The premise is a bunch of very capable people. Colonel Badass, McGyver, Assassin for Hire, and Mr Chameleon. They were "recruited" for the last mission and are now hooked - wanting to find out more about the mysterious power that they tried to recover last session.  I think i can get another session out of this, but then it might fade away <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/><br/>Basically - I need some ideas/methods to generate sessions <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Do the Fronts/Threats work on this scale?

Not knowing that, I'd suggest hooking in all the Player's Flags (character choice / skills / talents / traits / gear etc...) as PC's motivations or goals to your re-incorporated story elements: The mysterious power, the mysterious soldiers and competing groups. Make sure you have a motivation for your NPC's that antagonises the PC's interests. Aggressively scene the next session so as the players start with ACTION! a conflict or choice that leads in all sorts of exciting directions. If you can, allow for player authoring into the direction of these 'conflicts' and allow the system to adjudicate the outcome, not GM fiat. Always complicate on a failure instead of saying no.<br/><br/>As for your question on using AW fronts and threats, of course it works on this scale! Just follow the principles and agenda, even the moves, they tend to be a good primer for most story games style 'play to see what happens'. Hope that helps?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382415/#Comment_382415" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T06:37:26+00:00" title="June 15, 2012  6:37AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Noofy, he's explicitly not "playing to see what happens". That's the opposite of what the players have asked for.<br/><br/>Dionysus, the only way this style of play works, in my experience, is if you've got a story you're really excited to tell the players, and they're excited to hear it. You turn up with a session's worth of material for them to play through, they turn up prepared to play through that stuff, rise to the challenges, act out their roles, and beat the bad guys. Are you on board for that?<br/><br/>You don't neccesarily have to have a full story arc planned out ahead of time, you just need to be working with material you like, that's easy to come up with ideas for, and that you're comfortable improvising a little. For me, I can only do it with fantasy, because that's what my imagination likes. I don't think fronts and threats are the right approach here, except in as much as they give you ideas for surprises to throw at the players.<br/><br/>My generic template for this kind of session (to play through in two or three hours) is three main challenges (set piece fights, social showdowns, sneaking/infiltration scenes) glued together with some clear clues and some unsubtle connections. Think of three cool images, and work out how to make them happen in the game.<br/><br/>Then you just make up backstory and metaplot to explain it all, and it comes across as complex and compelling storytelling.<br/><br/>The drawback to this kind of play is that it's exhausting to prep for, and it can be unsatisfying to play long-term, since it's not really player-driven at all.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382416/#Comment_382416" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T06:47:17+00:00" title="June 15, 2012  6:47AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Noofy, he's explicitly not "playing to see what happens".

Your advice is spot on in that case. I was simply suggesting prep ideas for a 'branching' semi-structured concept based on already determined settings, antagonists and objects. I don't believe this isn't the 'opposite' of what his players asked for, nor is it destructive advice, especially considering he has a fondness for AW 'style' play. I still think his system of choice and its inherent reward cycle would help determine the methods of prep he needs to do for a satisfying plot-driven yet player choice laden play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382420">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382420/#Comment_382420" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T07:45:32+00:00" title="June 15, 2012  7:45AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2012 8:36AM by Teataine.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            doublepost                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382421/#Comment_382421" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T07:46:02+00:00" title="June 15, 2012  7:46AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2012 9:29AM by Teataine.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doesn't Marvel Heroic do something lile that?

(hence the questions from me as its not my best point - making long plots to follow, I at most do an intro "plot" to kickstart the game and then follow the characters around).<br/><br/>""You turn up with a session's worth of material for them to play through, they turn up prepared to play through that stuff, rise to the challenges, act out their roles, and beat the bad guys. Are you on board for that?""<br/><br/>That is pretty much what they are asking for. They made their "heroic" characters and have specific flags of "I want my guy to be doing X during this game and be awesome doing it".<br/><br/>I have some pretty solid flags<br/>Colonel - buy guns for team + tactical leader (man with the plan)<br/>McGyver - be in suprise situations without right tools, (make the tools)<br/>Assassin - be sneaky, deal with criminals and hurt people with extreme prejudice (boom!)<br/>Chameleon - need to pretend to be/trick other people. (face man)<br/>(I really need to go watch A-team)<br/><br/>So that gives me some ideas to put into those "Three big challenges" Simon C talks about. <br/><br/>The Game is nWoD (which they are all familiar with and asked for) but I'm going to be giving XP for dealing with and uncovering mysteries  so asking "What did you learn about X this session" and giving XP when they uncover new things. And the things they "uncover" will be fed back into the game and used more in later sessions. (mainly use this as a way of seeing what the players paid attention to most during the game and to keep using the things they like - yeah, might be a little bit of a cop-out)<br/><br/>Might also have something about the clues.. give XP for following clues?<br/><br/>The main "rewards" in WoD are Willpower (almost fate points...) and XP (for getting new/better abilities)  It might be a nice way of focussing on the "plot" by giving out Willpower when the characters make progress on the plot? (fate points for acting on tropes?)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rabalias" title="rabalias"><img alt="rabalias" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://en.gravatar.com/userimage/13975177/05fabf2f530a5a081b62b0cf469c7a48.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rabalias">rabalias</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382464/#Comment_382464" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T14:42:02+00:00" title="June 15, 2012  2:42PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds like you need a heist type plot to me.

Which gave me some ways to fit the three scenes in even better to their characters.<br/><br/>So "The Boss" sends them to find another of the mysterious powerful beings...<br/><br/>But now I have <br/>* Colonel trying to save the population of a small city surrounding the nuclear power plant.<br/>* Assassin calling in favors from criminals trying to kill Dr Lector and capture his children... (who seem to be similar to the mysterious being from the previous session)<br/>* The Chameleon falling in love with the mirror girl (who is an "alien?" child of Dr Lector") and wanting to save her (from the assassin and their boss)<br/><br/>Seriously fun - and my players are asking for a second session this week rather than waiting for next week... <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><br/>Seems the easiest way to get these guys interested and engrossed is to:<br/>a) put up a hard task.. (capture the exploding alien that looks just like a human)<br/>b) throw in a second complication to make it even harder (its next to a nuclear power plant)<br/>and just when the think they have it solved and a plan in place...<br/>c) suddenly ninjas (or the opposing team jumping in).<br/><br/>The weird and wonderful things these guys come up with is great, and they literally are feeding me ideas as they go <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>The "Three ideas, + clues" works wonderfully. And the clues really are clue-bats really. Follow those principles from Teatine and it all flowed smoothly. I have another player who wants to join in (and was sitting in during this session). But with the advice I've got from you all I suddenly feel a lot better about all of this <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks again <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382747/#Comment_382747" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-18T20:58:59+00:00" title="June 18, 2012  8:58PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you need more stuff later (though it sounds like you're getting a lot of ideas from paying attention to your players, which is PERFECT and totally not cheating) look at those character flags you listed (and come up with more as the characters flesh out a bit) and see what sorts of things you can get out of combining 2-3 of them.<br/><br/>Like Assassin + Face is pretty obvious - a chance for the face to distract someone while the sneak is sneaking and stabbing.<br/><br/>But some of the other combinations are less obvious and may inspire more ideas.<br/><br/>But of course, just because you created a challenge with roughly a solution in mind, for god sakes, don't let that be the only solution that works.<br/><br/>If you present what you think is a guy that should be distracted while the assassin sneaks in and the McGuyver suddenly has an awesome gadget solution (and hasn't been dominating the game by having an awesome gadget solution for every goddamned thing), go with it. The player answer is the right answer. That's not cheating either. That's being a responsive GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
