Worked great!<br/>* Witch-question stayed open until the very end. Table conspired to create great cast of characters that led to "is she a psychologically damaged girl or the actual spawn of the devil manipulating her brother?" setup.<br/><br/>Cribbed from the end of the AP, my list of take-aways:<br/><br/>1) When playing with new players, lead by example<br/>2) It's totally cool to jump in and point out to players when they're doing things that create stagnation. How you do it is super important. Being positive is strangely effective.<br/>3) Witch is really, really good. Montsegur, but even more streamlined.<br/>4) Be careful of too much twisting. We did alright, but I felt there was definitely some stuff where we had to wear blinders and march through without looking at the story we'd crafted too much.<br/>5) Warmup is a really cool idea.<br/>6) Echoes are cool (poisoning, burning houses, the witch speaking through others)<br/>7) The ending of Witch really soars if both outcomes (innocent/guilty) seem equally plausible. Was Eloise a disturbed girl with an evil satanic brother or did she work her dark magic through her poor, innocent brother? Both were possible.<br/>8) I need to play a lot more games, and I need to find a stable group again.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mr%20Toad" title="Mr Toad"><img alt="Mr Toad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mr%20Toad">Mr Toad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373032/#Comment_373032" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-16T03:35:13+00:00" title="April 16, 2012  3:35AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2012 3:35AM by Mr Toad.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the AP Daniel.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm glad you had a good game...this makes me really want to finish it (Witch - TRtL) off.<br/>\nI have all the character art work done and am currently working with Rich Lacy (the layout guy) to get some fluff art in the text.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo those of you unfamiliar with <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.ukroleplayers.com/witch/" rel="nofollow">Witch</a> it features on episode 69 of <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.jennisodes.com/podcasts/london-indie-rpg/" rel="nofollow">Jennisodes</a> where it is bigged up by the London Indie RPG crew.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to know more or have any burning (sic) questions feel free to ask away or send a PM if you prefer.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nKevin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_373033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielZKlein" title="DanielZKlein"><img alt="DanielZKlein" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielZKlein">DanielZKlein</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373033/#Comment_373033" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-16T04:59:57+00:00" title="April 16, 2012  4:59AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The thing I liked best about Witch was how straightforward it was to run with people new to the hobby. <br><br>Oh, one thing I forgot in the AP that I found actually didn't work so well were the moods the text prescribes for the different acts. Act 1 started out gloomy as all fuck, nevermind that the text says "Mood is HOPEFUL". I tried to remind people of this a few times but even my own scene didn't turn out hopeful--I set it by a river, early in the morning, for hopeful imagery, but it turned dark and confrontational really quickly.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mr%20Toad" title="Mr Toad"><img alt="Mr Toad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mr%20Toad">Mr Toad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373037/#Comment_373037" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-16T05:53:53+00:00" title="April 16, 2012  5:53AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haha!<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah I had similar feedback from the Indiecon playtests.<br/>\nWith that in mind I rewrote the colour text for the scene.
