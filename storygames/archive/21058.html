How about if players together with their neighbor also select a couple of vision cards? Instead of five each, you'd have X amount for yourself, Y amount in common with your left neighbor and Y amount in common with your right neighbor for a total of 2Y+X. I'm thinking 4+1+1 looks like a good number but 2+2+2 might be better.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461967/#Comment_461967" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-15T07:35:02+00:00" title="April 15, 2017  7:35AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Depends on what you're aiming to develop/accomplish with the vision part of character creation, I suppose. In my current GM-less adaptation of the game, a large part of initial vision has been shaping the kind of Realm each individual Spherewalker comes from - which makes me think, sharing vision cards would be great for player characters who share a common origin. What's <i>your</i> aim? Are you trying to weave together player characters into a group or a common starting situation since the very beginning or character creation?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461969/#Comment_461969" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-15T07:39:12+00:00" title="April 15, 2017  7:39AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This idea was a byproduct of another thing I was working on and I just wanted to toss it in here before I forgot.<br/><br/>The aim is for the shared vision cards to be reincorporated in play. The players might take revenge on their shared teacher or some such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
