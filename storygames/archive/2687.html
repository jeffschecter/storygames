I also think that characters are the most fun when they are making progress and having an impact on the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been thinking that the right way to do this is to give people two goals:  The crazy, unattainable, true goal and the workable, challenging sane goal that they think (mistakenly!) will lead directly to their true goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in <i>Kitten's First Full Moon</i>, Kitten has a true goal of "Get the bowl of milk in the sky" and a sane goal of "Run around like a freakin' little maniac, trying to stretch, jump or climb as high as you can."  What makes it a wonderful story is <i>both</i> that she makes such spectacular successes at her sane goals <i>and</i> that her true goal remains forever beyond her reach.  "Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for?"<br/>\n<br/>\nIn <i>Firefly</i>, Malcolm Reynolds has a true goal of "Restore freedom to the universe" and a sane goal of "Keep on flying, no matter what."  Again, part of what makes it a wonderful story is <i>both</i> that he has such spectacular successes at his sane goal <i>and</i> that his true goal remains forever beyond his reach.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis gap is both what keeps a character driving <b>and</b> what leaves a place in the story for acts of grace and faith by other people:  Kitten returns, dejected, to her home to find that someone has set a big bowl of milk out, just for her.  Lucky Kitten!<br/>\n<br/>\nHow can you sell this idea to players, so that they are as excited about creating a wonderfully unattainable True Goal as they are about planning out the steps for their Sane Goal?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61623/#Comment_61623" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-20T10:44:43+00:00" title="March 20, 2007 10:44AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One way to sell it is with fantastic examples, two of which you've provided here. When I read about those characters, I go, yeah, I want to play someone like <i>that</i>.<br><br>Another selling point is control. When I play Mal, and I <i>know</i> I ain't bringin' freedom to the universe, then I have a lot of authorial control when I set a scene that revolves around Mal trying to bring freedom to the universe. I know he's not gonna get it, so I can play to that angle with supreme confidence. The exact outcome of the scene will be in doubt, but since I know for sure that Mal's goal is too big and crazy, I'm free to explore the drama, comedy, or tragedy within it. It's a safe space I've carved out in the narrative for myself.<br><br>PTA does this with Issues.

I love kitten's first full moon. In fact, some of my best ideas come when I'm reading bedtime stories to my toddler.<br><br>Last year we played a pulp fantasy game where my character's goal was to restore himself as the rightful King of Mars. It was a blast to play this crazy guy who went around telling people he was the King of Mars and inviting them to join him in his quest to reclaim the throne. Miraculously, he came rather close to acheiving his goal (thanks to some pretty amazing dice rolls at the right times). Currently I'm playing a character whose goal is to find God, literally, on the subway. This has been a bit harder. I'm finding you need more than just a crazy goal, but the crazy goal definitely helps.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61630/#Comment_61630" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-20T11:51:08+00:00" title="March 20, 2007 11:51AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the crazy, insane, change-the-world goal ought to be the one with mechanical heft; the reasonable goal should have either no mechanical impact or much less of one.

Then, I remembered that the few times I've seen this exact thing in-game, it was written in the <i>character background/backstory section</i>. Through roleplay over time, and a refresher every once in a while with the other players with "what my character's backstory is", it came into play at times.<br/><br/>The example that comes to mind is my own, actually: I played a Vampire game where my character was a Ventrue (noble) diplomat-leader kind of guy.  His goals were to uphold the family and keep the city at order, yadda yadda. But my character background was that I was fascinated by stories of Caine, and looked to either find the secret of Golconda or, if unattainable, spend my life trying to un-twist the fucked up knots and backstabbyness of Vampire culture. So yeah, Im-Possible.<br/><br/>And yet, there were times (usually once a session) where that one choice was made, here and there, in relation to that goal: Let the Toreador spy go. Be willingly played rather than exposing a conspiracy right then and there, in the hopes that the people involved would get bored of it. Stuff like that.<br/><br/>Maybe there's a way to "enhance" that element of the Character Background ("What's your favorite clothes? Hangout? Friends?

with much more action and reaction, than just falling back on the same old motivations.  you'd have to supply a new motivation.  yes, both characters would have the potential to be "cool", but i doubt Bruce would still be Batman.  and Kal El would be fought over like a wmd.   without the need for his "normal" identity, and possibly "normal" life...he'd more than likely become very callous, very soon. i'd be guessing, first quite cynical, than just numb.   like an old military leader.<br/><br/>why can't you play Batman or Superman as is?   this is a personal question, not really game theory related.  they seem to have clear motivations, and meaty ones at that.  well, maybe more than a bit melodramatic.  <br/><br/>yeah, kal el giving up his attempt at humanity, and bruce finding his, could be a good story, could be a difficult game though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment"

character's "kicker" will be resolved. But that from the sound of it, the only way for that to happen is for somebody besides the player to decide that it has. That is, another player has his character give my character what he needs to get his Q-goal. Or the GM has some NPC give it to him. Like in the example, having the father NPC give the son his approval at last.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that the concern is that the player can't strive for it somehow (perhaps mechanically). Worse, what if the player isn't done playing through that goal yet? What if the player, unlike the character, doesn't want the Q-goal to resolve yet?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn practice, I think I know what you'll answer, Tony, and I'd agree that this isn't really an issue.

(I still feel myself newby here.)<br><br>I think it is a very interesting, if not crucial point, what if the player doesn't want to resolve the Q-goal. I think this is important, because the player him/herself decided in the first place that this goal is not attainable. The player sais: "I have this and this as unattainable goal.", then once like lightning from the bright sky, comes the GM-fiat and tells the player: "No, it is attainable from now on. You only have to ask for it. No, you don't have to thank me. Anytime. Bye." If the player him/herself said, (s)he wanted it as an unattainable gole, why should it be resolved in-game? I think this is a fully metagame issue.<br><br>If we look at these unattainable goals what are they for? They strengthen the character, make him/her able to something. The kitten to climb etc. I think that it would give a mechanical advantage is not only a sideeffect of a background, but it is the only purpose of it. (I think it is called motivation in the filmindustry.)<br><br>What if it would not only give simple mechanical advantages, but the only role of it would be to give the player one mighty advantage that cannot be measured? For example my character has "I want to fully eliminate the crime in Gotham." What does that mean? This Q-goal gives my character (Batman) the ability to be the best crimefighter in freakin' Gotham. It's not only +3 dexterity and such. How should this work mechanically? I think that the Q-goal should give the player GM-powers. The player should get permission to overrule the other players on the field of the Q-goal. For example if my character is Batman, and I am investigating the footprints, I can tell the other players instead of the GM what those mean. Maybe it is a bit too awkward example, but something like this.<br><br>And in this case noone would ever consider to resolve the Q-goals except if the player is bored and would like to have another instead of the old one.<br><br>Gabor                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67031/#Comment_67031" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-06T17:48:27+00:00" title="May  6, 2007  5:48PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just what makes that little old ant<br/>Think he\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll move that rubber tree plant?<br/>Anyone knows an ant, can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t<br/>Move a rubber tree plant.<br/><br/>But he\xe2\u20ac\u2122s got high hopes, he\xe2\u20ac\u2122s got high hopes...<br/>He\xe2\u20ac\u2122s got high-apple-pie-in-the-sky hopes!<br/><br/>So any time you're gettin\xe2\u20ac\u2122 low<br/>\xe2\u20ac\u2122stead of lettin\xe2\u20ac\u2122 go<br/>Just remember that ant!<br/>Oops, there goes another rubber tree plant!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67032/#Comment_67032" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-06T17:52:40+00:00" title="May  6, 2007  5:52PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: algi</cite><br/>What if it would not only give simple mechanical advantages, but the only role of it would be to give the player one mighty advantage that cannot be measured?

In story theory, there's the Goal of the story, then there's what has to be done in order to reach the goal. I would argue that one of the steps Kitten has to take towards succeeding or failing in his goal to get the moon is run around try to jump or stretch to it. Likewise, Mal has to keep moving, keep doing small justice until it all adds up to big justice. We also have to admit that the outcome of a goal can be either success or failure -- both put resolution on the aspiration.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe distinction between Goal and Requirement is useful for RPG play because the Goal is what the character aims for, but the Requirement is what he or she spends most time doing. In PTA, the player is arbiter of when the character has done enough of the Requireiment to achieve his Goal -- this is the moment when the player changes the character's Issue. <br/>\n<br/>\nSorcerer is interesting because, instead of focusing on the goal, the Kicker mechanic generally focuses on the Consequence -- what will happen if the character doesn't do something. Sorcerer allows the group to decide when enough Requirements have been followed for the Consequence to be squeleched or guaranteed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67075/#Comment_67075" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-07T06:36:27+00:00" title="May  7, 2007  6:36AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alan:  Fascinating.

That part doesn't apply to story games, as the goal is often determined only through play.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, I think it suggests a useful distinctions between the goal and the efforts made to reach it. <br>\n<br>\nWhat you say about not necessarily "doing" happens to fall right in line with this theory. It posits four realms of conflict in a story: external situation, external activity, psychological landscape, and psychological activity. The theory says that for a story to feel complete and satisfying it needs to explore all four of these somehow.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a typical Firefly episode--the Train Job--everybody is involved in the external activity of acquiring the drugs on the train. The requirement for resolving that would be understanding (by acquiring external information) who deserves the drug. Meanwhile, Mal has a personal external situation -- he's captain, responsible for the mess he's gotten his people into and for his contract with Mr. Niska. This is only a one hour episode so it doesn't get to fully develop the story, but it does hint at the other two realms -- Crow is fixed on pursuing Mal (psychological landscape) and Mal and Crow try to persuade/intimidate each other (psychological activity).                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67502/#Comment_67502" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T05:15:52+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  5:15AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2007 5:16AM by algi.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kynn:<br/><br/>Sorry, I don't see it.

I think there's a qualitative difference.<br/><br/>Alan:<br/><br/>As I know in a movie script the characters have (if I remember right) Goals and Needs. Goals are what they want to achieve (for example get in bed with Angelina Jolie), and Needs are what they have to achieve to get a better life (for example fall in love with a decent girl - not that I would imply that Angelina Jolie is indecent). The story has a happy end if the need is achieved. The drama comes from the realization of the Need (the Goal becomes equal to the Need).<br/><br/>In a roleplaying game I imagine the Goal as a Q-goal and the Need is a long term goal wich is agreed upon in metagame. The character is fighting to achieve the Goal, but the players (including the GM) are fighting against the character, to achieve the Need or realize it at least. (A very dramatic turn can be, if the character realizes the Need but doesn't want to achieve it. For example he still wants to complete his vendetta at any cost.)<br/><br/>The adventures (the sane goals) are small tools that bump the character in the right way. Sorry if it is trivial or common knowledge, but I think the use of this in RPGs can be quite powerful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67591/#Comment_67591" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T12:16:52+00:00" title="May  8, 2007 12:16PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: algi</cite>Sorry, I don't see it.

The new deal is here: <a href="http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#using-aspects" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.faterpg.com/dl/sotc-srd.html#using-aspects</a> - specifically, look at invoking and tagging for effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67881/#Comment_67881" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-09T10:40:00+00:00" title="May  9, 2007 10:40AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, where is that thanks button when I need one? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Thanks, I can see it now. Although I wouldn't use in my system any mechanics in its relation. No point spendings and it wouldn't affect the die rolls at all. But that's just my personal take on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
