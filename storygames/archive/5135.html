Choose from one of three approaches: the supernatural as myth, as fantastic, or as reality. Characters are created by choosing their pursuits in life, be it empathy, faith, magic, the occult, science, or vigilantism. Those who have been tainted by the supernatural gain secret knowledges for their chosen pursuit. For example, those of faith gain Divine arts, those exploring magic find sorcery, and those interested in science often become mad-scientists seeking to make monstrosities.<br/>\n<br/>\nGhostories includes everything you need for Supernatural Mystery Roleplaying, yet does so in a tidy and light PDF package optimized for download and printing. Four scenarios are provided to get you started, as are numerous story ideas, sample horrors, and special rules for discovering clues and handling fear and dementia. Plus the game is compatible with Coyote Trail for Western Horror and Mean Streets for Film Noir Horror.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt="gs2coveraq3.jpg" class="bbcode_img" src="http://img146.imageshack.us/img146/9444/gs2coveraq3.jpg"/><br/>\n<br/>\nThis one was designed by me, with Peter C.

How does the approach differ (or not) from the Gumshoe system, traditional game cluehunting, or Inspectres? Can you elaborate a bit on the three approaches as well - does having the supernatural as myth entail Scooby Doo -like debunking investigations or something different?<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Eric                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/brettmb" title="brettmb"><img alt="brettmb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/brettmb">brettmb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115952/#Comment_115952" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-21T16:12:56+00:00" title="December 21, 2007  4:12PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, here goes...<br/>\n<br/>\nClues are categorized, so that you can plant them as needed. For example, there are overt clues that require a simple comparison of ability to difficulty - these are apparent if the character is perceptive enough. Then there are hidden, cryptic, and forensic clues that require either an investigation task (roll) or some sort of research task (like behavioral or biological sciences). Finally, there are serendipitous clues that the GM can use to help propel the story in a certain direction or to give the characters a hand. I don't know enough of the other systems to compare them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs myth can be played like a debunking investigation (yes, Scooby Doo), or simply as a single entity or occurrence that defies known physics. The knowledge of such activities are not widely known.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs fantastic can be played so that there have been known cases of paranormal activity and some of the characters may have supernatural abilities -- they could be mediums or diabolists (summoning phantoms), for example, and NPCs are more open to the idea of ghosts, et al.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs reality is for 'anything goes' games, with monsters at every corner and characters with the powers of sorcery and mad science.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game is structured so that you can start with myth, with the characters choosing pursuits (theology, science, vigilantism, etc) and that after time, everything shifts into the fantastic with the characters now possessing tainted pursuits, giving them paranormal powers that amplify the original innocent pursuits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
