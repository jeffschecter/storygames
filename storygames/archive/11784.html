Particularly I like how XP is handed out - it's not based on the predicted difficulty of an encounter, but the actual outcome. Easy, average, difficult. If you have something that should be easy, but you get a ton of bad rolls, it counts as a difficult encounter. The degree of success measure is also interesting, as is the stunt system. Character backgrounds are nice too, it found an excellent way to make humans not boring, by actually making them diverse, and the mechanics strike me as fairly easy to grasp.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263199/#Comment_263199" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-21T04:00:27+00:00" title="March 21, 2010  4:00AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2010 4:00AM by Teataine.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I found it lacking. It has some cool ideas, but all around it did not appeal to me. I guess it would be good as a starting game, but is perhaps a tad overcomplicated for that, and for a veteran roleplayer there really isn't anything in there that would really catch his eye. It falls somewhere in between. IMO, YMMV, etc.<br/><br/>P.S.: I didn't play it, just skimmed the books, so I might be way off the mark.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263200/#Comment_263200" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-21T05:14:11+00:00" title="March 21, 2010  5:14AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While it doesn't have much, I found it to have a very well directed focus. There's one source of magic, rather than two or more, so that's rather easy to handle on that front. The religion is recognisable, as is the society. Ferelden is a land of free-men, so the social structure isn't foreign, compared to say, Harn, which has a very feudal structure. The pecking order is also recognisable - the better you are as a fighter, the higher your social standing. This works rather well with a combat focused game that's based on levels - your level represents not only your prowess but your renown. The various races and social groups have either real world analogues or are recognisable tropes. The Dalish Elves are Gypsies. You could go with City Elves being Blacks back when there was still segregation. The Circle of Magi is reminiscent of the Psi Corps from Babylon 5, or Hellboy with the super powered beings working for the government. <br/><br/>The mechanics are somewhat similar to D&amp;D - enough that anyone who's played either D&amp;D or just a CRPG should feel right at home. Character creation is fairly simple, a matter of making a few choices, a few rolls and tabulating the results. Combat also strikes me as fairly simple. The basics are easy, but the stunt system adds some complexity to it. Since the stunt opportunities come up randomly, it's not something which will bog down play the way powers do in 4e. You're not going to be choosing what the best strategic option is every single round, you'll be doing it once in a while.<br/><br/>Overall, it feels like everything was done deliberately, from the rule choice and what's included, to the included backgrounds and classes, to the default starting location. It's something like one of those quick play games, but rather than being enough for just 1 or 2 adventures, after which you need to go out and get the full set, you can get yourself a considerable chunk of play out of it. I also found the narrow starting focus to make it easy to understand - there's nothing like looking at a 400 page, complete tome that's the one book you'll need to play and being slightly overwhelmed by all the options.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263238/#Comment_263238" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-21T11:12:05+00:00" title="March 21, 2010 11:12AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 21, 2010 11:12AM by Rafu.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had a lengthy thread about that, not too long a time ago: <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=246378" rel="nofollow">link</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_263547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo" title="1000buffalo"><img alt="1000buffalo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.jadelantern.com/lantern/images/GoPlayLantern.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/1000buffalo">1000buffalo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263547/#Comment_263547" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-22T18:55:34+00:00" title="March 22, 2010  6:55PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've run it, and both players - one with moderate experience, the other with extensive experience - enjoyed it.

The dragon die and the stunt point system are really fun in combat, and I felt there was just enough stat and skill resolution for a fantasy setting.<br/><br/>Character gen sucks rocks however. The random rolls make for too much potential disparity among the player characters. For example my three players had stat totals of +5, +7 and +12 after rolling. Also it seems that while you can build perfectly good warriors and mages, 1st level rogues are not particularly rogue-like. Rogues tend to start out as ordinary joes (who can do sneak attacks).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
