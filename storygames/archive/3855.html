I'm a softy for 'em, as I'm frequently told Nine Worlds is one of 'em. Here are a couple of mine: <br/><br/><b>Conspiracy of Shadows</b> -- Keith's got a solid game here. The text is sometimes too concise. It requires you to read it, and then put pieces together in your head when you realize things like "Oh shit! Doom is awesome!" And, the conflict modifiers seem ho-hum at first, until you start to realize how they can combine with weapons (which are, like in The Shadow of Yesterday, not always literal weapons, but modifiers for situations), and then you're off to some funky damn scenes. And, there are some places where it needs examples desperately. <br/><br/>And Witchblood. How cool is that? It's fucking cool. I will later Frost Dance my Coke and have a nice lunch.<br/><br/><br/><b>a/state</b> -- I really dig this game. Hell, I even like small parts of the ho-hum system. (Penetration rules! I actually dig that. I made rules like that once. I smile thinking about it) But, that system is still pretty bleakly ho hum. But the setting! MY GOD IT'S MADE OUT OF PEOPLE! Ghostfighters, Flowghosts, Lostfinders. The races! Holy hot shit, the ekranaplane races. The whole thing gives me a hard on. I want to be a Ghostfighter so bad. Just bad ass, those guys. This game is fucking cool. I want to run it in another system. And, saying that sorta feels like sleeping around on your new girlfriend. Or something.<br/><br/>I'm not sure a/state is too under under appreciated. I <i>think</i> it has seen a pretty good following overall. But, it sure isn't talked about much where I hang out.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86489/#Comment_86489" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T09:02:45+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  9:02AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A/State only gets good things said about it, but as you note, not much IS said of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86490/#Comment_86490" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T09:03:17+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  9:03AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Continuum:</b>  Could possibly be my favorite game of all time, if only there weren't so much paperwork required to run it properly.

I think games with serious subject matter like this can be a hard sell, but they are really, really worthwhile.<br/><br/><b>Covert Generation</b>. This one is a cool little game about teenage anarchists. It's a true indie product, from a guy hardly anyone around here knows, and it's his only book. Because the author developed offline and doesn't participate in various indie games fora, it has no buzz, but it's fun, and definitely has a story-game structure.<br/><br/><b>Fastlane</b>. This is a tough one, because of the roulette wheel mechanic. You can play it with dice, but the wheel is the biggest barrier (along with the design, as mentioned elsewhere on Story Games). However, it hits its theme hard, like a sledgehammer. You literally bet your character's stats in order to perform actions. That is cool.<br/><br/><b>Hero's Banner</b>. This is a good game, and again, it's had some indie scene buzz, but that isn't reflected in its sales. The structure, with its tightly constrained story arc and short character lifetime, might put some folks off, but this is another game that hits its theme with a sledgehammer.<br/><br/><b>Nine Worlds</b>. Matt mentioned this above, but it's another indie game that doesn't get as much traction as I think it should. Tight, elegant mechanics and a truly cool setting.

And I think 9W is the game to use to play in that setting.<br><br/>Either I'm going to wait 2-3 months for the new Exalted 2E Sidereals book, or try to find a copy of the 1E book for less than $10, and I'll be ready to fly I think.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86633/#Comment_86633" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T13:14:53+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  1:14PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Marvel Universe was truly awesome, even if you stepped one step in any direction. <br/><br/>There was one or two examples that were unclear and people cried about them.

It's done with a <b>tactile</b> element. You are physically moving counters around on your character sheet, adding them from this pool and throwing them out to that pool.  That is a method of learning that has great power particularly for my group. <br/><br/>Furthermore, it limits GM fiat "in the moment", and shifts it all to the preparation section, which keeps things fresh for the GM and makes decisions easy to make on the fly. You just look at your resources and move them to the right area.<br/><br/>The system lends itself to minor improvisations of the sort that make comic book style (or action-cinematic style for that matter) roleplaying fun without sacrificing the basic engine.<br/><br/>In addition, it's highly extensible.  I added a "drama pool" mechanic that would simulate the comic book/action movie/age-old cliche of bad guys who are awesome in act 1 while the good guys bumble around more or less switching competency levels by act 3.  It worked without a hitch. I've also done a stealth subgame with it (similar to combat) for a Thief: The Dark Project fantasy adaptation.  For that same adaptation I simply changed the "ranges" on attributes from hugely-superhuman to a tiny-bit-superhuman and on abilities from comic-book-broad to technothriller-broad.  The system didn't even hiccup.<br/><br/>This is a system that you can easily change to make it yours. (You know, like you do with every other system even if you don't think you do.) The central resource allocation system is very, very robust.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86761/#Comment_86761" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T17:37:46+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  5:37PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Great Wolf</cite><cite>Posted By: MikeRM</cite><br/>Nobody expects the Nine Worlds exposition.</blockquote>\nFor the win!<br/><br/>Oh, Matt was totally fishing for that one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Because the system was something that was put in there because one was needed, by a guy who admits he is not perfect at creating systems you ended up with a fairly basic precentile one. I strongly believe that this overshadowed the setting. However what really sent it off the rails was the designer moving on, now he is not so in love with huge settings but ones more focused ones that can tell stories. Missing the fact that A/State could tell amazing stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nFates Worse Than Death: There is something amazing here. Although it does try and put too much into the one setting (psionics, aliens, cults), but at the same time oversimplifies things (there is only one Drug Dealing cartel, because they all decided shooting at each other was to costly..."like criminals do not fall to greed?"). However I still believe it is great for old fans of Cyberpunk, to me it moves the genre on (even though some say it has nothing to do with it) and because of its mistakes people have missed the gems hidden within. I will never sell my book for this, but I will likely never get to run it either.<br/>\n<br/>\nWitchCraft: because it was so tied to and derivative of WoD and sold by a game company with a slow release schedule this game is not as big as it could have been. Again its because there is a damn good world in some bad missteps with the setting and the system linked with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86913/#Comment_86913" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T08:05:58+00:00" title="August  9, 2007  8:05AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            there's a lot of little press indie games that haven't yet been mentioned, in my mind that would mean they are under-apreciated.<br/><br/>The princes kingdom<br/>The Farm (by the indomitable J-sor)<br/><br/>and i'll be greedy.

Was it content, the order of things in the book, or typographical errors?<br/><br/>I didn't edit that book but Malc asked me to check it for typos when people kept complaining about them. Having proof-read the first 60 or 70 pages pretty carefully I gave up. I'd found only a few errors. There were a lot of strange words -- granted they were obscure -- but they were spelt absolutely correctly. There's also dialogue that is spelt phonetically, but they aren't typos.<br/><br/>And as for outside The City? That old chestnut. There is nothing outside The City. That's not a spoiler, but an observation. There is nothing outside The City that is germane to the game of a|state. If you want to explore outside then you need to play another game.<br/><br/>Bizarrely I think a|state is now underappreciated by its author. Harsh? Maybe.

Never played it, but meant to. It's a pretty light system (and yet has some cool crunchy combat digs). Last night I started reading the "special abilities" which are really tied to the setting, and I was stuck by how cool it was.  It's like it treated Silent Hill and KULT as a buffet, picking and choosing tasty morsels, and wrapped them up in one game.  I'm thinking of bringing this to run finally at Games on Demand. We'll see.<br/><br/>It's far, far, far slicker than it looks. And I've never seen ANYONE so much as mention it.  I'm going to give it a shot either at GenCon or the months following, and if it works I'm going to help change that.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/10/10398.phtml" rel="nofollow">RPGNet review</a><br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87252/#Comment_87252" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T08:46:26+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  8:46AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>It's like it treated Silent Hill and KULT as a buffet, picking and choosing tasty morsels, and wrapped them up in one game.</blockquote>\nHoly shit, why have I never heard of this game before?

I think I've heard it mentioned once around these parts, but it really deserves more mention.<br/><br/>In fact I think PIG as a whole are a fairly underappreciated games company, which is a great shame. Their games are consistently high quality and entertaining, with fantastically rich settings and a refined system. Plus, by taking on Story Engine, they always seem keen to try out new things, or to dust off older ideas and make them better.

Look a little deeper. Yes, it's a simple fantasy game with no setting and some mechanical issues at higher levels (oh yes, it has levels), but the Saving Roll mechanic is a thing of beauty, a universal resolution system well ahead of its time allowing a surprising subtlety of play without having to fudge things outside of the rules. Combat incorporates "critical hits" right into the attack rolls, no extra tables or calculations, because you're comparing totals to establish who won the round and how much damage they inflicted; on top of that, damage automatically reduces the effectiveness of a monster in subsequent rounds.<br/><br/>If it sounds old-fashioned and samey then that's because it has been around with relatively minor changes for over thirty years and plenty of games have tried to occupy the same ground. Greg Costikyan once mentioned it as the game he'd pick to run fantasy, commenting that it is "dumb but adequate to [his] needs." I don't think it's dumb, really, maybe a little too simple in places and too constrained by the standards of the time to look innovative these days, yet of all the "traditional" RPGs this is the one that lets me get on with playing an interesting <i>character</i> and exploring exciting and challenging role-playing with the game supporting me but not getting in my way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bartmoss" title="bartmoss"><img alt="bartmoss" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bartmoss">bartmoss</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87518/#Comment_87518" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-11T10:33:29+00:00" title="August 11, 2007 10:33AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Anemone</cite><br/>a|state not only has an indifferent system, but it had (at least in my printing) poor editing, something which really puts me off.</blockquote>\nI agree on the system, more of which later. But the editing? I can only imagine you are talking about the density of information that book has for The City. I think its all needed, the atmosphere drips of the page. But I did fall for this game big time.<br/><br/>Also as a concept The City is supposed to be one large location, but within that large location you can go to different places. One Burgh is so unlike another.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Gregor Hutton</cite><br/>Bizarrely I think a|state is now underappreciated by its author. Harsh? Maybe. But I think it's got many more layers than Cold City.</blockquote>\nI get that feel also, Malcolm does seem to have moved on and now look back to a/state as something not particularly fantastic. However my feeling is that what he dislikes about it is that there is not a system within the game that drives the story. If he could look at a/state again an add a system that drives story I think he could see it for the fantastic product it is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Look a little deeper. Yes, it's a simple fantasy game with no setting and some mechanical issues at higher levels (oh yes, it has levels), but the Saving Roll mechanic is a thing of beauty, a universal resolution system well ahead of its time allowing a surprising subtlety of play without having to fudge things outside of the rules. Combat incorporates "critical hits" right into the attack rolls, no extra tables or calculations, because you're comparing totals to establish who won the round and how much damage they inflicted; on top of that, damage automatically reduces the effectiveness of a monster in subsequent rounds.<br/><br/>If it sounds old-fashioned and samey then that's because it has been around with relatively minor changes for over thirty years and plenty of games have tried to occupy the same ground. Greg Costikyan once mentioned it as the game he'd pick to run fantasy, commenting that it is "dumb but adequate to [his] needs." I don't think it's dumb, really, maybe a little too simple in places and too constrained by the standards of the time to look innovative these days, yet of all the "traditional" RPGs this is the one that lets me get on with playing an interesting<i>character</i>and exploring exciting and challenging role-playing with the game supporting me but not getting in my way.&lt;//img&gt;</br></br></br></br></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88057/#Comment_88057" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T13:39:47+00:00" title="August 14, 2007  1:39PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Black Fire is super cool.
