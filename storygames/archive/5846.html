I am also trying this out at Snail's Pace, but Snail's Pace lacks critical mass.<br/>\nBelow are the rules and the game seed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rules for this game are simple:\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText"><b>F1 Re: Esc</b> is a game for people who are bored at work with just enough time to read a forum. The goal is to keep your creative juices flowing, shrug off the negativity, and escape from the grind.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>No Homework</b> accumulates in this game. Even if there\u2019s a game in progress, all you need to do is read the Seed and the most recent Challenge. As the game goes on, there\u2019s still never an obligation to "catch up" on the thread, or even to Claim a Prize.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>The Seed</b> starts the game; after pasting these rules, the OP writes 100 words and then issues a Challenge in 20 words or less. From then on each post should Answer, Cheer, or Claim a Prize.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Answer</b> by writing a response to the latest challenge in 100 words or less. Don't Answer your own Challenge. Try to work in the same spirit as the seed, but there is no wrong way to answer a challenge. In the same post, issue a new challenge in 20 words or less. This challenge doesn't name a specific person, just what you want someone to make.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Cheer</b> by quoting an Answer written since your last post and declare it a Winner. If you've never posted you can declare any Answer a Winner. Spectators and lurkers are welcome to declare winners even if they don\u2019t post themselves!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Claim a Prize</b> after someone has declared you a Winner. You Claim a Prize by writing, in 120 words or less, on any topic you want (but not issue a Challenge). Again, try to work in the same spirit as the seed, and again, there\u2019s no wrong way to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Crossposting with Honor</b> If you find you have cross-posted with someone else, and your challenge appears below theirs, then your challenge is considered honorary \u2013 it can only be answered by a winner if they choose to answer it when they Claim a Prize. If you see this it\u2019s a good idea to edit your post and show that your challenge is with honor.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nSeed:<br/>\nThere is violence here. Above all, in this neon hay-day, there is violence. It's not knives or guns. It's people. A crack in the room, and this girl trips through the crowd. With the music blaring, I don't hear her say, "You got anything?" I shake my head. I have nothing. I am a badly shaven cowboy in an unfamiliar place. I'm looking around at the leatherbound nightmares and wondering what I'm going to have to do to find Zingo. I just want to get the goods, hand over the money, and get the fuck out of dodge. This is a scary city, and it sure as hell ain't licensed.

It dawned on me, in little fragments like when you try to re-assemble an old love letter that you tore up years ago. The only reason Mant didn't put that barrel to the back of my head back at the club is the girl. I glance over at her, bleeding and sparking. "Well, child, I owe you one." Sling 'er around the shoulder. It's time for a safe space. A safe space where Mant wouldn't go looking, where Zingo owns nothing, where people can rest and be human. I don't know if the girl's going to be allowed in; if she isn't, I'm going to force her way in. She saved my life, after all.

Not knowing how to react, I rolled a bum and stole his blanket - not the most noble act I know; but I was low on energy and ideas - wrapped her tight, and carried her into Reeve's Pub, with that "don't fuck with me" glare that Lou once told me I should trademark. It only took a few minutes for the quiet hum of exposed wiring to leak out of the blanket, and Lou looked... concerned.
