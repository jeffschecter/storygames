                    I'd like to talk about becoming a better gamer in the most gamist sense of the word. I think this is a topic that's sometimes neglected. What's your opinion of "playing to win" in RPGs? Is there a place for it? And if so, how do you get better at it? Is it just min-maxing? Munchkining? Does it belong in some games but not in others?                </div>

<br/>
Ahem.<br/>
<br/>
Question One:  No problems.  In fact, its why I play, most of the time.  If there's not some aspect for me to "game," I'd probably rather just sit around chatting.<br/>
<br/>
Question Two:  Yes.  Even in hippy-nar games. :)<br/>
<br/>
Question Three:  Practice, understand the rules, pay attention, know your options.<br/>
<br/>
Question Four &amp; Five:  No, its not just minmaxing, and it certainly isn't just Munchkining.  That plays into it to a point, but I find that gamable systems tend to have subjective parts, where minmaxing becomes a judgement call in the eye of the beholder.<br/>
<br/>
A bigger part of "playing to win" is paying attention, knowing what's going on, and being a force in the thick of that- a player who shows up with an absurdly optimized character who sulks in the corner, and just says "I kill it and take its stuff" when a fight rolls around is less succesful than someone who reads the rules and knows the combat strategies and is willing to think on their feet and adapt.<br/>
<br/>
Question Six:  I can think of no game that would not be improved by having bigger numbers and giant robots.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect you're loading this post up with way too many questions to get a coherent picture in one thread, but good luck!                        </div>

                            But Jason, what if MY playing as hard as I can isn't the same as YOUR playing as hard as you can?<br/><br/>I mean, let's imagine we're playing, say, Dogs, to give a good common point of reference.<br/><br/>You're playing your Dog to engage the town.  You're spending relationship dice on the inhabitants, you're listening and investigating and judging and killing sinners.<br/><br/>I start playing my Dog for Dog-Dog drama.  My Dog is disagreeing with other Dogs over points of theology, getting into Dog-Dog conflicts, and generally complicating matters.<br/><br/>You respond (because you want to engage the town, but don't particularly care how) by aligning your Dog with mine, and agreeing with him; you "give" on the Dog-Dog conflicts.<br/><br/>I respond (because I'm all about the drama) by pushing my Dog into ever more extreme positions to try to get you to disagree.<br/><br/>I think you can nerf fun by playing as hard as you can just as badly as by not.                        </div>

                            If all the other players are defining winning as telling cool stories, developing interesting characters and dramatic situations, while another player believes winning the game is "last man standing" -- there's a problem.  That player is going to disrupt the game for the rest of the group.<br/>
<br/>
If all the other players have defined winning as mastery of the game system, and who can beat the other players using that system in some way, while a lone player is trying to do something non-competitive and narrative focused, there's probably a problem there as well.  Particularly when another player removes them from the game to get "more points".<br/>
<br/>
I think the group should always understand what the goal of the game they're playing is, and make sure it's a game they're all going to have fun with.<br/>
<br/>

                            Wow, it's cool to see that people are on board with playing hard. It's weird, because I've always been a role-player who identifies as being more intererested in story than in score points. Yet I find it very hard to enjoy a game without some kind of competitive spark. I wonder if it's because competition is somehow inherint in humanity and human drama. Have any of you systematically tried to get better at playing RPGs, or at playing one RPG in particular, and how did you go about it?<br>
<br>
I ask because I'm sort of curious about how that happens. I've spent a lot of time tyring to improve my performance at various games, but not so much in the case of RPGs. Things you did to make your self a better storyteller count!                        </br></br></div>

                            Again, depending on the game itself, different things will make you better -- but probably most of all: practice. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>
<br/>
I think things like acting classes, acting experience (community theatre etc), public speaking, an teaching will all help with your delivery/presentation to some degree.  Creative writing, drawing, painting, etc will help with your creativity.  Playing a wide variety of games -- not just RPGs -- will help you with your strategy and tactics.                        </div>

                            I think this subject is pretty hazy, even though I can see where people are going. What exactly does it mean to 'play hard' in a narrative game? I can see that phrase meaning...<br><br> - To be serious and committed, and give it your all.<br> - To compete in some way, and have your ego on the line, in terms of who's playing the best narrative game.<br> - Aggressively using the resources/mechanics of the game to maximize your own power, in order to get what you want (with the principle, presumably, of enlightened selfishness justifying it: what's good for you will be good for the game; each player has to look out for himself).<br/><br/>Some of those are preferences of mine, but maybe not all of them. Anyway, some clarity on what we're talking about seems necessary. What's a concrete example of someone playing hard vs. not playing hard?                        </br></br></br></br></div>

<p>William Burke and I have been talking a lot about his concept of "accepting system" lately. It means, you examine a system's structures of reward and punishment, and <em>choose</em> to act in the form-and-spirit of that structure, confident that it's rewarding you for good things and punishing you for bad things.</p>
<p>That's playing hard, to me, and I think it's great. You get better at it by getting better at reading systems and seeing what they want out of you, and simultaneously by reading your fellow players and seeing what their readings of the same systems are like. When you play most effectively, you are playing with well-aligned conceptions of the text and deep understandings of it.</p>
<p>As for playing to <em>win,</em> well, that's what you do if your game has a win condition.</p>

                            What Jasper said. <br/><br/>I think that everyone is going to say that they appreciate effort. But the question is what sort of effort. I'm seeing all sorts of agenda clash here potentially. Put another way, sure, there are agendas where "playing to win" is valid. But there are others that will clash with it horrifically. As long as the group has that agenda across all play, no problem. Simple as that. <br/><br/>Note that I have a pet peeve with the term min-maxing, in that it's used derogatively. That's an artifact of incoherent designs. That is, according to Von Neumann's Min-Max theorem - which is the genesis of Game Theory, players will always try to maximize their benefits while minimizing costs. This is not some bad behavior, but simply the most sensible thing a player can do at any time. Giving opportunities for a player to min-max, and then expecting the player not to is bad game design. Period. Just calling it bad behavior is simply saying that you don't share the gamism agenda that the game is promoting with it's min-maxing opportunities. <br/><br/>These sorts of derogatory terms simply come down to players making specific notes of clashing sorts of agendas. The "munchkin," a term that came about from convention reports of relatively young kids come to play D&amp;D in a very straighfrowardly gamism manner, simply means that the player in question is playing D&amp;D in one of the various other ways that the system supports, and doesn't like the way the kid plays. The kid may never have seen another way to play it, so expecting him to just know better, when he's enjoying the way he plays, is non-sensical. <br/><br/>How do you get better at it? Well, if "it" means gamism, then do you mean at being an effective player? Are you seriously asking how one becomes better at strategy and tactics? Or does the question mean something else?<br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            Keep in mind that the System includes not only mechanics.  You can get better at addressing in-game challenges, for example, if the game and/or your GM promote creative solutions.  That means you not only learn how to use the numbers and multiclassing and dice probabilities and whatnot, but you learn to engage with the fictional world by using your creativity.  Your character and narration make use of location elements, or tricks, or existing social webs.  Some games foster this somewhat (like Iron Heroes and even Sorcerer) by giving you bonuses if you do this right.  The only game that actually focuses on that aspect, that I know of, is the one I'm getting close to publishing <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            So is "playing hard" merely "playing well?" Or is it a preference; a style, that cuts across creative agendas, and which one might reasonably advocate for? (Is it the same thing as Tony's "Play like you mean it"?)                        </div>

If you have to choose between scoring points and telling a good story, then the system has different goals and priorities from you.  Saying that you choose between scoring and telling a good story is saying that the system is rewarding bad stories.  And why would you want that?  Why not play a system that rewards good stories?                        </div>

                            Heya,<br/><br/>Aw yeah, I'm a sold out gamist myself.  And dammit, I gotta get off my ass and get my games published.<br/><br/>Okay, to your questions!<br/><br/>Question 1:  My oppinion is that gamist supporting games are mega fun.  They might be considered the most basic form of gaming because everyone has a natural desire to "win" at something.  However, I caution you not to focus just on winning.  Gamism is more about addressing Challenge than it is about reaching the goal line first.  The fun is in the hard work it takes to get the prize, not the prize itself.<br/><br/>Question 2:  Heckyeah there is a place for them.  Gamism is just as legitimate a Creative Agenda as Narrativism and Simulationism.  You can have fun doing all three.  And you dont have to resort to traditional gaming tropes to support that CA.<br/><br/>Question 3:  Heh, well as with anything you need practice.  But also I encourage thoughtful analasys of game design.  Examine <i>why</i> certain options are presented in the rules the way they are.  Consider applications for an option that are unusual or "outside the box."  Play multiple games and be mindful of your own play decision.  It helps to post in Actual Play forums as well.  <br/><br/>Question 4/5:  Min-maxing is a legitmate strategy, but it's not the only one.  Pay close attention to currencies and reward cycles in the game.  That's where the real system-strategy is.  As for munchkinism, I don't know what you mean by that exatly, but it never has good conotations.  I tell my friends to leave detrimental behavior at the door.  That usualy takes care of it.<br/><br/>Question 6:  Yes it does belong in some games and not others.  Polaris would be a very poor game to play with the Gamist agenda.  DnD however, rocks for Gamism.  And remember, it's not the games themsevles that are Gamist or Narrativist or whatever, it's the players.  Certain games can support that play style, but if that style is at odds with what everyone else wants to do, that will kill your fun in a heartbeat.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>
