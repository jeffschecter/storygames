If you want Non-Commercial Share-Alike this is fine.  But if you select the simple Share-Alike others cannot combine it with any material from any Non-Commercial CC license.  If you want people to be able to do this, then I would suggest releasing it under both BY-NC-SA and BY-SA, so that others can use your work for commercial or non-commercial purposes.  (If you want to make sure you can reuse any derivatives from other people in your own commercial work, then stick with BY-SA.)<br/><br/>To illustrate:<br/><br/>Adele takes a photo of a butterfly and wants to share it with others.  She doesn't care if they make money or not, so she licenses the photo as BY-SA.<br/><br/>Bobby takes a photo of dragonfly and wants to share it, but doesn't want anyone to make any money.  He doesn't care if others share derivatives, so he licenses the photo as BY-NC.<br/><br/>Charlie wants to put the butterfly and dragonfly into one picture, but can't without getting permission from Adele (or possibly Bobby), even though in this case both Adele and Bobby would be okay with it.  If Adele had licensed her photo with BY-SA and BY-NC-SA, then Charlie could make the desired picture.<br/><br/>Just something I ran into when making the Lady Blackbird Companion (which I was kind of got around there since it's a collected work).  I found it annoying, and also probably a little too fascinating.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365833">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biggles" title="biggles"><img alt="biggles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biggles">biggles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365833/#Comment_365833" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-07T23:50:49+00:00" title="March  7, 2012 11:50PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Individual authors can re-license the parts they own copyright to and grant exceptions.

I understand that this is starting to be the case in the USA as well - in the past US cultural industry has apparently worked off a work-for-hire assumption (that is, it is assumed that the publisher owns the copyright to whatever it is they publish, unless a contract has specifically been made otherwise), but if I remember correctly nowadays you actually need a specific contract to that effect before work-for-hire is considered sufficiently demonstrated.<br/><br/>However, be that as it may, it should be easy enough for you to ensure that everybody retains their own rights in your joint publishing project. Just put a note to that effect somewhere in the work itself (this is mostly to be absolutely clear on the matter - as discussed above, the law already supports this as a default most everywhere), and don't sign any contracts that say otherwise. Note that this does nothing for the dilution of publishing rights: I've met people who have somehow gotten the impression that a first publication of something or other doesn't "count" if they retain their own copyright; obviously these are two separate matters.<br/><br/>Separate rights to separate parts of a work are not usually a difficulty in a joint publication. The real tricky part is the rights to the amalgamated work itself, especially in cases where you can't separate the contributions of two or more partners from each other meaningfully. I believe that most copyright laws assign copyright in these cases to the entire team communally: they control the copyright by concensus. <i>This</i> is something you might wish to change by transferring some limited rights. Otherwise it would be possible for e.g. one minority participant to discontinue the publishing of the work unilaterally. You can prevent this by having the team assign the publisher with non-exclusive right of publication in perpetuity within your target market, for example. Or you could do what Ben Lehman once suggested me: have every participant cross-license the entire work to everybody in the team, so that instead of everybody being unilaterally able to prevent the usage of the work, you could instead have everybody be separately and independently able to further exploit the work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365847/#Comment_365847" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T03:10:01+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  3:10AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2012 3:10AM by Sanglorian.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: biggles</cite>Individual authors can re-license the parts they own copyright to and grant exceptions.

You might think you're within Fair Use territory (U.S. then?) but you're probably not if it's (as you say) a "fan project." Painful truth is that it's probably a derivative work, and thus, you are violating the copyright of the people of whom you are a fan.<br/><br/>Even if you're right, doesn't mean they can't sue you. Then you have to prove you're right and they're wrong, in court, and you'll want a lawyer for that, and lawyers cost money and are unpleasant to deal with; q.v. JDCorley (kidding!). So it'll cost you lots of money to be right, if you're right and not wrong, in which it'll cost you a lot more money. Also, by the end of that process, you will no longer be a fan of the people who created the stuff you love, and they will certainly not be a fan of you.<br/><br/>So first and foremost, get their permission. Ask nicely. Explain your undying love and devotion and explain your project in sane terms. Then they will a) ignore you, b) say no, c) say yes, or d) say yes with conditions (like a contract, license, and/or payment). If a) or b), that's a no. DO NOT continue because you just made your life more miserable in court if they can say, "they even came to us and asked and we said no." If they say yes with conditions, you can choose to follow their rules, or you can choose not to do your project. If you don't follow their rules but do your project anyway, you will be EVAN MOAR miserable in court, and you will owe them lots of money. Maybe they'll just say "sure!" and you can do your thing, which would be all unicorns and rainbows. Good luck!<br/><br/>But until you work out those issues, don't worry about how to license <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">your</span>their stuff to other people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366207/#Comment_366207" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T07:41:25+00:00" title="March  9, 2012  7:41AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Scott,<br/><br/>I think the simplist way to handle it is to ask each rights holder to agree to a contract like this: <br/><br/>"I grant permission to (Scott) to reproduce my work (work title) in (fan project) for (period of time)."<br/><br/>Copyright holders can grant permission to license/reproduce/etc work under standard US copyright law without having to use creative commons, as far as I understand it. this is assuming, of course, that the person is the original creator of their work, etc etc. <br/><br/>If you intend to have the entire project under some other kind of license, I think you'd have to get each right holders permission to apply that license to their work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
