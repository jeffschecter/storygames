                    I'm having some trouble with the board for GRS. It's...okay...but a bit dull. It just needs something and I don't know what.<br/><br/>Here is is, in the universally accepted and loved Microsoft Word format.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.catchyourhare.com/files/A1.doc" rel="nofollow">Front left of nightclub</a><br/><a href="http://www.catchyourhare.com/files/A2.doc" rel="nofollow">Front right of nightclub</a><br/><a href="http://www.catchyourhare.com/files/B1.doc" rel="nofollow">Back left of nightclub</a><br/><a href="http://www.catchyourhare.com/files/B2.doc" rel="nofollow">Back right of nightclub</a><br/><br/>And it works like this. Those pink explosions are Insertion Points: where each Squad Member starts. Then they make their way through the nightclub. Those blue arrows are guard patrol routes. <br/><br/>Also, there's loads of security devices that aren't shown on the board. The first part of the game consists of the players putting down markers on the board and saying "This is a triple-strength steel security door with voiceprint detection access!".<br/><br/>And the blue star is the target: the guy you've got to turn straight.<br/><br/>Basically, it's meant to be a sort of Metal Gear Solid vibe. It's a throwback to a game called Escape From Colditz which I had as a kid. It's meant to be all secret passages and tunnels and guards to bribe and stuff like that.<br/><br/>But it's missing something. It's not grabbing me. What does it need? What kind of stuff would you want on here?<br/><br/>Graham                </div>

                            Oh, that's brilliant stuff, thanks.
<blockquote>How is guard movement determined? I'm thinking of Kill Dr Lucky and the way that Dr Lucky moves through the house following a series of numbers in rooms.</blockquote>
When a player rolls a die, he moves his character; but he also has to move a guard the same number of spaces. The instructions are to "move the guard that will cause someone else the most trouble". <br/><br/>I must get Kill Dr Lucky.
<blockquote>If you get grabbed by a guard, is there a holding cell somewhere that you get taken to?</blockquote>
Ah, yes, that's good. I'd originally thought that you'd return to an Insertion Point, but that's better.
<blockquote>Can you distract the guards by knocking on walls and such?</blockquote>
Yes. That's where it becomes more like a roleplaying game than a board game. You can try <i>anything</i> like that: you can blow holes in the wall, if you like. If the group likes it, it works; if not, it doesn't.
<blockquote>What about when someone plays "Staff Car" or "Do Or Die!"?</blockquote>
Oh, Do or Die! That's brilliant. I must put that in.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

There's "Insertion Point" as well. That was meant to be an innuendo. Perhaps "Penetration Point".<br/><br/>You're right, though. There need to be dark corners and side rooms and places to seduce people. <br/><br/>Actually, come to think of it, I think there need to be <i>people to seduce</i>. The guards should probably have names and pictures. And there should be an oily, muscular mechanic in the garage.

Yes, of course. It's vaguely possible the players might do this when they set up the security devices, of course: "Here's a security door! You need a keycard to disable it and that's kept in the garage!". But it needs better support than that.<br/><br/>Lev, thanks. Soy. Yes.

                            Re:  People to seduce - every player could have the responsibility to author one or more NPCs as complications and opportunities.  Maybe they appear on the board and move like guards, or maybe they just sort of show up where they are needed, or maybe they are the result of certain rare card combinations or something.  Edit:  Or they are predictable - you know when you enter the cloakroom you'll have to confront the hat-check boy.  <br/>
<br/>
Kill Dr. Lucky is worth checking out for the movement, observation, and procedural elements.  I think it is a bad game, personally (it takes too long and has low replay value).  Heresy, I know.<br/>
<br/>
What if you had a series of cards for security devices, and each device was actually two cards:  The device itself and the location of the thing to disable it?  Too board-gamey, perhaps.                        </div>

Come to think about it, I *THINK* I have a spare copy of KDL lying about at home.  Yours in exchange for a pint if you want it (If I still have it that is).<br/><br/>I ran a supers game about a year ago which had a villain in called Manhole.  His publicist had decided that the name, combined with the slogan "He's as one with the sewers!" would make him really successful.  Needless to say, it didn't.  Also, one of the PCs, a martial arts type, was gay.  People kept making comments like "If you got into a fight with Manhole, do you think you could lick him?"<br/><br/>Good times.                        </div>

Yes, I think players can place the Straights on the board, and describe them, just as they place the security devices. Nice.
<blockquote>What if you had a series of cards for security devices, and each device was actually two cards:  The device itself and the location of the thing to disable it?  Too board-gamey, perhaps.</blockquote>
I'm not afraid of board-gamey, but I don't want to take away the opportunity for the players to think up bizarre security devices. The idea is that the board handles all the tactical-movement-stealth bits of the game but the thinking-up-fantastic-plans bit stays with the players. If that makes sense.<br/><br/>Useful.

Yes, that's a good idea. Perhaps different maps you can play the game on.<br/><br/>Colour coded levels. That's funny. I might do that. And I'm not <i>quite</i> sure how the stats for the recruiters will work, yet. I think they might just have a set of skills.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>
