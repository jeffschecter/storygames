I'm considering using different colors for different attitudes  (see below), <br/>       again using stickpins to make angles when needed...<br/>   -  our game focuses on the origins of Delta Green, our investigators being the first agents building the "green division", so I'm thinking that on the board <br/>       at the top center I'll have images of each PC and in the center I'll have the "Innsmouth Incident" that began the whole "Unidentified Intelligence" (UI) <br/>       investigations...<br/><br/><br/>NOW... questions and advice I'm seeking:<br/>   -  What additions, changes or suggestions do you have to my above ideas for a traditional Relationship Map and/or a classic detective corkboard (like 'the Wire')<br/>   -  Do you have any pix or links to show samples of one of these cork boards?<br/>   -  What colors of yarn should I use?  I'm thinking one for 'enemies', one for 'contacts', one for 'allies', etc... Do you have a suggested color code scheme??<br/>   -  Any suggestions on the cards or other props that would be cool to use or add?<br/>   -  Any other suggestions on making this a useful Relationship Map?  I've never built/used one.

If Bob and Jim are partnering up to investigate shady dealings at the Innsmouth Bank, you stick the "Innsmouth Bank" branch of the investigation diagram with a red flag.  When Jim and Sandra go poke around Whately manor, the Whately branch gets the yellow flag.  Then later on, when Dave stumbles across something pointing towards the bank or the Whately estate, he knows who to go to for more information.<br/><br/>It's also a way of working in the PCs as part of the relationship map in an organic way, because as they keep tangling with more and more of the story, each encounter is getting marked visibly on the map.  They're not a block of cards in the lower right with a few connections here and there...rather, they are the web which pulls the entire board together.  <br/><br/><br/>The other thing I'd mention is something I always like to see in a game dealing with crimes: making it <i>personal.</i>  It's one thing for detectives to be investigating a murder, it's quite another for them to be investigating the death of <i>Daphne Roberts</i>, whose <i>mangled body</i> was found washed up on the shores of the bay.  If you organize the investigation by its victims and put the identity of the victims front and center, it's a great excuse for the characters to really sink their teeth into the investigation.  It can elevate the routine of policework to a crusade, and that's good drama.  That interrogation where they're asking the suspect where he was on the night of April 11th is so much better when they're making the guy say the poor girl's name, when they're telling him how her body was found, when they're describing her parents' grief.<br/><br/>So if you've got identifiable victims, it might be worthwhile to organize your board around them.  Make those pictures and those names the central hook upon which all the "active" parts of the map are hung.  Victims give everyone a way to remove the comforting distance between the elements of their investigation and the acts which they are investigating.  Victims force you to stop looking at the big picture and consider the horror of the events in a more human context, to consider long term effects on individuals.  This seems especially appropriate for a Lovecraftian game, what with the whole emphasis on lineage and the perverse twists of family trees and the terrifyingly intimate horrors of small New England towns.<br/><br/><br/>As far as the aesthetics of the board go, I always liked green for money connections, red for either conflicts ("at war with") or family (blood ties), and I'd totally go with black yarn for occult connections.  I'd also suggest keeping everything neatly lined up in columns and rows, as if you're following a rigid governmental bulletin-board maintenance protocol.  Then you can use the crazy diagonally-mounted positions for fun artifacts (the murder weapon, the "suicide" note, etc.) or wild theories or angry comments from their superiors.

What about posting the PC investigators at the bottom (to give a feeling of weight on their shoulders of all this stuff),  then the catalyst event of the Innsmouth Incident of Feb 1928 on the right side,  and grow things out from there?<br/><br/>Should the PCs be immediately connected to all the stuff they've encountered in the first 2 sessions?  Should the PCs even be on the board at all?  Or should they NOT be on the board until they become intimately involved in an event/crime  (like if one of their family members was involved, etc...)?<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><br/>Victims give everyone a way to remove the comforting distance between the elements of their investigation and the acts which they are investigating.

I'm also thinking in terms of The Wire, in that you're starting out with a lot of unknowns and the characters are going to be filling in the blanks through their investigations.  In fact, in most seasons of The Wire, the board starts out with a single name and photograph on it, and nothing more.  <br/><br/>Perhaps (probably, in fact) that's not where you're coming from, in which case just scavenge what you can from my suggestions and put your own spin on it.  It's your board, you get to decide what you're going to do with it.<br/><br/><br/>If it was me, I'd be organizing the board like it's a resource for the investigators, and I'd probably focus on people rather than events or places:  there would be victims, there would be suspects, there would be org-chart style layouts describing cults, there would be known associates and witnesses, and there would be occasional bits of evidence or testimony stuck in here and there waiting for a specific name to be attached to them.  How the PCs fit into the mix would probably not be on the board at all, except as occasional notes like "Bob discovered this" or "Billy shot this guy," and I'd trust that the players would remember how they feel about the NPCs.  (I might keep a more traditional set of notes/rudimentary relationship map for my own purposes in order to track how the NPCs feel about the PCs and how they feel about other NPCs if that information isn't available to the players yet, but that sort of thing wouldn't go on the board.)  If "follow the money" is a valid strategy in the game, I'd probably include important assets on the board, so they know that Josiah Marsh owns the local flour mill and the cannery, while his brother Ezekiel owns two sporty roadsters and runs a string of whores out of the old Overlook Hotel.<br/><br/>By the way, I love your idea about attaching little sticky-note flags to the strings, that's a beautiful way to set up the usual r-map descriptors like "hates" or "owes favor to" or "works directly for."  Definitely go with that, it's a great idea!<br/><br/>My ideal board would be something that evolved over the game, as the PCs learned new things and met new people and discovered new connections.  It would be something we could point to when we're stuck ("Look, we never followed up on how the boat captain figures into this, and whether he knew anything about the odd-looking townsfolk with shotguns we met on the way back from the dock"), or something we could pull colorful descriptions from ("I whack this card with the pointer when I tell him 'RIGHT HERE IS YOUR PROBABLE CAUSE, NOW GET ME THAT SEARCH WARRANT!'").  I'd pray for a dramatic moment when someone realizes that they can reorganize the entire board and suddenly the tangled and inscrutable mystery becomes crystal clear ("What if the Church of Dagon and the mobsters are all getting paid off by the same guy?").  The players would have as much say in what new cards and strings are added and where they go as I would, if not more.<br/><br/>Your mileage may vary.  It <i>should</i> vary, in fact.  It'd be pretty weird if you liked the same things I do. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177677/#Comment_177677" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T09:11:09+00:00" title="November  7, 2008  9:11AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're the GM yes?<br/><br/>By creating an in-game artefact on behalf of the PCs, aren't you effectively deprotagonising your players?  You're now deciding what their characters do, what's left for them?<br/><br/>It also sounds a bit anachronistic for the 1920s, but I may be wrong on that and that may not be that important anyway.<br/><br/>For my Gangbusters game, the players spontaneously started using a whiteboard to keep track, but that was their call, not mine.<br/><br/>I would personally recommend if you do use this idea that the PCs do not start on the map, but are added to it if their relationships with the NPCs later make them as meaningful as the people already on the map (which hopefully they shall).  I think that would be both more useful and cooler.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177678/#Comment_177678" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-07T09:16:38+00:00" title="November  7, 2008  9:16AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 7, 2008 9:16AM by D-503.">edited November 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>The other thing I'd mention is something I always like to see in a game dealing with crimes: making it<i>personal.</i>It's one thing for detectives to be investigating a murder, it's quite another for them to be investigating the death of<i>Daphne Roberts</i>, whose<i>mangled body</i>was found washed up on the shores of the bay.

Watching Bayliss obsess over the murder he could never solve, the way he was constantly referring to the dead girl, the way the show kept all the detectives cycling between routine and crusade from episode to episode...it really got me hooked on the victim being the soul of a good murder story.  You can build good mysteries out of all kinds of things, from money to land to anything else anyone has any feelings for whatsoever, but murder is about <i>people</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
