Are there things to twiddle in a particular set of rules?  Are there situations specific to a certain set of characters or a setting that you can play with to make this rock?<br/><br/>To be specific, I am talking about keeping the same set of characters in the same setting, with the same rules.  Don't patch the characters into a different game, don't jump to a different place or time and try to tie it back in to the campaign later.  Just scary up your dungeon crawl, space opera or super slugfest.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150381/#Comment_150381" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T06:18:42+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  6:18AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2008 6:19AM by Steve_Segedy.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Generally, I've found that horror scenes are about power and subtlety.  If your characters are normally in charge of things- the baddest asses in town, never backing down from a conflict- you flip the situation and make them truly powerless.  If the characters rely on powerful magic, they slowly realize it doesn't work <em>here</em>, against <em>them</em>.  If they are relying on the vacuum of space and their energy shields to keep a safe distance, they'll panic when <em>it</em> is suddenly standing right next to them, whispering in their ear.<br/><br/>The point about subtlety is just that small, almost inconsequential details often have a bigger impact than big flashy terrors.  If it's a raging demon in the middle of your dungeon, ringed in flames, roaring for the PCs blood, they'll probably assume it's just another monster they have to deal with.  If it's a the shadow of a child, moving slowly down a hallway in complete silence, they'll have no idea what to do with it- they don't even know if it's a threat.  But maybe they shouldn't wait around to find out...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_150463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150463/#Comment_150463" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T09:57:17+00:00" title="June 13, 2008  9:57AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say that the "Our weapons are useless!" effect, and variations on it, is a sort of terror.<br/><br/>Horror is when something WRONG happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150473/#Comment_150473" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-13T10:08:45+00:00" title="June 13, 2008 10:08AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In last week's TSoY session, a bunch of people got drugged (thanks, Steve!).
