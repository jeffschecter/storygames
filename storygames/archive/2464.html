                    This is about gaming systems where you have set stakes and are now battling towards your stakes. What will you bear/sacrifice to win?<br/><br/>For instance, Dogs in the Vineyard. An experienced player will start noticing their Fallout dice and try to decide how far they will push it, possibly to the character's death.<br/><br/>But (and my main query is about this), what does it in TSOY? The only thing I can think of is determining how much Harm you're willing to take into the next situation(s), possibly meaning that you'll lose them (but you don't know what they're going to be over). But, you can also 'cure' Harm in different ways, so a player might well decide to hold off on an important scene until they're ready to go again.<br/><br/>Other games can be explored. I'm trying to figure out how to inform new players on 'when to give' and why.                </div>

                            I can think of some negative examples, if I am understanding you correctly.  A lot of console games (and some older tabletop games) allow your character to continue to be completely effective up to the last "hit point."  SJG's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In Nomine</span> gives you a somewhat randomized option for whether or not you're going to go over the top from dissonance.  So there's less investment until you're "close to 'failure'", if character change/death can be considered failure.   Heck, in Amber there's only GM consensus for when the PC has gone "overboard" and how he or she will suffer (or gain) from the encounter.  It may be too idiosyncratic to measure.                        </div>

                            I'll give you another good counter example: the Masquerade LARP system (at least, as-was.)  No indication at all that you should give, which meant that players would go around RPS (sorry, of course I mean "<em>Hammer,</em> Paper, Scissors") at each other all night.  <br/><br/>TSOY's Harm mechanic is actually a better indicator to the experienced player than the Fallout in <cite>Dogs</cite> is.  Because Harm really does suck to accumulate, it's a lot better to give to intentions you can live with than it is to stick around in a losing fight - even if you pull it off.  And contrariwise,you're more likely to win with an intention that your opponent can live with - captured or evaded instead of killed, for instance.                        </div>

                            First point: mechanics for "giving" and the like are not universal and not necessarily necessary (you like that? that's why they call me the wordsmith!); they are part of the larger thematic question "how much are you willing to give to get what you want?" which is one of many approaches to game design.  So, for instance, <em>FLFS</em> has nothing similar because that question is pretty much totally irrelevant to play of that game.<br/><br/>Secondly: <strong>Agora</strong> conflicts produce both fallout and burnout.  Fallout is going to whip around at the end of the scene and make you re-evaluate and re-write your character's central beliefs.  Burnout is <em>already</em> lost resources -- you're never getting those dice back -- but at the end of the scene it will be rolled for a continuing advantage of another sort.  So a player looks at both to gauge how much they want their character to change as a result of this, and how many resources they want to lose.  However, they may also <em>want</em> to push the character to change, and they may <em>want</em> to grab for that alternate advantage.  So while there may be some mechanical pressure to give, the same mechanic can also be exploited, or used as a sort of counter or gauge for the level of import of the conflict.<br/><br/>Point being, the question of "when to give" is something that's really, really complex and very, very contingent on a host of other bits of data throughout the game.  I would go so far as to say, in fact, that a straightforward mechanic guiding the player when to give is going to produce some pretty boring play.  "When to give" is in many ways a central thematic decision in the games where it appears, and if it does not take as inputs the vast landscape of the rest of the game, it's short-circuiting that decision.                        </div>

                            Let me rephrase it then in terms of actual play. I'll be dealing with my own experiences in the past and hopefully I'll be able to answer questions I anticipate in the future.<br/><br/>I was in a game of TSOY with some magic and demons and stuff like that. I had a magical Ability that allowed me to perform a ritual to summon and bind a spirit to me that give me bonus dice and the narratorial ability to describe magical features <br/><br/>A rebellion had begun and, unbeknownst to me, an NPC that I had sought shelter with earlier (and failed) had taken a liking to me and wanted to take me away from it all to save me. Deciding that it would make a great twist to just accept his offer, I did so and took the Key of Love to boot. Off we went on a whirlwind trip that led us to shipwreck on an island inhabited by a race of creatures that were subservient to a race of demons that were responsible for the rebellion on the other island.<br/><br/>We were in their tribal gathering spot and they were trying to decide what they should do with us. The safest thing for them would be to kill us (in my character's opinion). However, I knew of their connection with the demon race and decided to start lying my ass off. I summoned a Chameleon spirit and when asked who I was I 'shed off' my human guise and appeared as a demon. This was directly in front of my new lover, and due to racial tensions, not the best decision. As soon as he got a chance, he ran away. He was betrayed, heartbroken, scared, and had a whole host of other bad feelings about me. I set out to find him and win him back.<br/><br/>I finally found him and tried to convince him to return with me, "it was only to save us", etc. He 'agreed' and when my naive character turned around he assaulted me. He wanted me dead and I turned the conflict into whether or not he would love me again. My social Abilities weren't all that great and he was winning quite well. I was willing to see this through until the end.<br/><br/>Why? Because I didn't have any idea (and still don't, really) about when any given level of Harm is too much. What am I weighing against? Future conflicts that I have no idea what they'll be over? Sure, I understand the narratorial concept of Broken and I know that I won't be winning anything easily until I've had a chance to heal myself. And, I even understand the round to round implications of what each Harm does, how it will hinder my efforts to finally win the Bringing Down the Pain, if I'm going to be able to do so at all.<br/><br/>But is there any difference between 3 Harm and 5 Harm AFTER the conflict is over? Yes, I get it, more pool points spent, more Refreshing scenes OR learning to like not getting what I want in conflicts.<br/><br/>Am I just missing the point? I'm willing to accept that if so. But, seeing as my character's Harm doesn't actually translate over to me, how do I know when they give?                        </div>

                            Just to add a side note: If each level of Harm had an individual Consequence that I had to deal with later, I think I'd get it. "Am I willing to risk yet another Consequence to get what I want?" makes sense. "Am I willing to add another Harm point to get what I want?" doesn't quite make sense.                        </div>

So, here, exactly: In the actual play I've been in, Intentions rarely change. Should I (or my GM) be pushing for harder Intentions at every opportunity?                        </div>

                            JBR has some good general observations, allow me to kick in a little bit on an even more general, strategic level.<br/><br/>Giving in/retreating is a strategy that is emergent from other rules. There is nothing in the rules of chess that "signals" you when a strategy is getting you into trouble and you need to pull back onto defense.  But an experienced player evaluates that kind of decision with every move.  As Tal said, "pawns are like buttons, once you lose them, your pants will fall down all by themselves". Similarly in the aforementioned 'hit point' games, there's a gamble involved in every move. <br/><br/>The heightened impact of losing the last piece of a resource is simply psychological, it is not necessarily part of the game.  Sometimes it can be misleading. If you're playing poker, the first $20 you bet is worth just as much as the last $20 in your wallet - still, there's strategy involved in buying pots and trying to whittle down opponents by the psychological difference between the two. <br/><br/>The question of retreat/giving in is emergent from the rules of many games. Absolutely there are different strategies for retreat in combat in (for example) D&amp;D and WoD games due to the lack of penalties for injury and the presence of attacks of opportunity in D&amp;D. To an experienced player of these games, there might not be a 'flag', but there certainly is strategic evaluation.<br/><br/>The same is true for Amber social gambits. But that's another story.                        </div>

                            Hey Mark,<br/><br/>I could be way off base here, since I'm not in your game. But here's a stab at it.<br/><br/>Maybe the trouble is that Harm has been stripped of impact in the fiction. I mean, sure, "1 point of Harm" in the abstract, isn't a big deal. No one cares. But! That 1 point of Harm was done to your character because of a specific, colorful, event in the fiction. <i>Something happened</i> to the character to really hurt them. So, one question to ask about when to give is, "Can I accept this hurtful thing happening to my character? Is winning worth getting hurt that way?"<br/><br/>When there's color, things matter. 1 Harm taken because your lover just said you were a soulless thing that desevered to suffer and die -- well, that's painful. Getting over that ("healing the harm" system-wise) will also be given meaning via the color of your fiction. What do you do to feel better about being hated by the person you love? Did you spend Instinct to recover the Harm? If so, what <i>happened</i>? Did you turn to the bottle? Did you pour your heart out to a stranger? You had to do something to "get over it." And that something is another element that can color a decision to give in a conflict. "Can I accept the things I'll have to do to recover from this kind of hurt?"<br/><br/>Whaddya think? Am I way off base? I've seen this happen in RPGs of all kinds. When color and impact in the fiction fall away, and people start marking down numbers and saying "I spend an Instinct" ... things can lose their bite.                        </div>

                            John,<br/><br/>You're right on, actually. I've been running through my head, trying to think how I'll explain the rules to the group. In my mind, I would say, "Here's how Harm works, blab Â³". But now I realize that I wasn't linking it to the fiction.<br/><br/>Now I'll just say, "When considering whether to push or give, think of what could happen with that next failed attempt. Your sword could be shattered in a duel, you could lose your memory of your sister trying to beat a magical trap, you could lose your friend trying to win this woman."<br/><br/>Should these things be announced before making the next roll in BDTP? These sub-stakes? This will be one of the first game with stakes that they will have played.                        </div>

                            Well, cool. I'm glad I was on track.<br/><br/>About sub-stakes:<br/>I think we're drifting a bit. Harm isn't a "sub stake" at all. Harm is just "getting hurt" -- whatever that means right now.<br/><br/>Losing the memory of your sister <i>could</i> be Harm (in some kind of psychic duel of memory-erasure), but more probably something like that would be "the thing at stake" in its own conflict resolution. Harm doesn't have to be grand or severe in order to be colorful.<br/><br/>Take your cue from the actions initiated by the characters. If someone says, "I stab him in the face!" during BDTP, and they hit and do some Harm... then yeah, they totally stabbed that guy in the face. How bad is it? How much Harm did it do? If he's Broken, then, damn... that there is an ugly face-stabbing. Maybe an eye is gone. If he's Bruised, then he has a nasty cut on his cheek and he twitches and snarls and curses from the pain. But he doesn't suddenly lose his best friend or something. The Harm flows from the actions taken, and the severity of the result.<br/><br/>Try to keep things focused on what the characters are doing right now, and the consequences of that stuff, without reaching out to bigger-scale, "so your mom sleeps with the demon!" kinds of craziness.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>Because Harm really does suck to accumulate, it's a lot better to give to intentions you can live with than it is to stick around in a losing fight - even if you pull it off.</blockquote>
So, here, exactly: In the actual play I've been in, Intentions rarely change. Should I (or my GM) be pushing for harder Intentions at every opportunity?<br/><br/>Well, there's a whole lot of discussion to be had on that point.  But quick thoughts:
<ul>
<li>The "I want you dead" stake is bad for almost everyone.  Unless I manage to start the Pain with 4 Harm or more, and the dice are looking my way, then maybe "want you dead" is a good idea.  If there's a question, I would rather set my intention at just-enough, because you're more likely to fold over $20 than All In.<br/></li><li>One awesome feature of BDTP is the switched intentions.  They don't happen often, but when they do, they're awesome.  "I'm changing my intention from winning the contest to banging your wife!"  That kind of thing.  And the big strategy there is to build up some harm with a tactic that you're good with, and then capitalize with something you're not as good with.<br/></li><li>Case in point: you brought the pain over "love me!/you die!" How is 5 Harm worth more than that?  If it's "forgive me/get away from me," maybe it's better to give than to take 5 Harm.  Because remember that broken is not "I get what I want," it's "I get to say what happens to your character."  <br/></li></ul> </div>

John has a good point about leading by example.  Your take away should be that, when you're playing an NPC, you have to offer intentions that the players will accept, and you have to Give when the NPC can accept the intention.                        </div>

                            Something else that worked for us was to re-negotiate intentions in the middle of BDTP, to entice a Give. It's not strictly by the rules, but we liked it.<br/><br/>"Man, I am so screwed here. I don't want to lose an arm!"<br/>"Okay, how about... you just get mangled? You're all messed up and require major healing, but nothing gets lopped off."<br/>"Okay, yeah. I can give to that."<br/>"Done."<br/><br/>But beware! This escape-hatch is not the ultimate solution or anything. Sometimes it's the wrong thing to do. Generally speaking, the TSOY GM should set up stakes that are dangerous and thrilling, and see if the PCs have the nerve to take their chances. After all, once you hear what's at stake, the PC has the option of not pursuing that line of action at all. This alone can be a powerful statement of what your character cares about, and doesn't.                        </div>

Hell, this is a skill I've learned by playing Go.  You're better off giving up a small weak group than fighting to save it - and by contrast, you always have to and hate to fight to save your dragons.  <br/><br/>If you're looking for the Gamism, then, consider the BDTP where the Evil Duke blocks the way of the PC hero trying to rescue the princess.  If the intention is "I get by him," is it strategically a good idea to play out a chancey fight and get the Evil Duke Really Killed, or let the PC go this time and keep the Duke around?                        </div>

                            Judson and John are speaking wisely. Here is one pretty important point:<br/>
<br/>
The game system ainâ€™t telling you when to give. If it did, itâ€™d suck. This is not about game mechanics, itâ€™s about fictional content. Consider the fictional situation, consider what giving or pushing through may mean. Also, and thatâ€™s the most important point, BDTP is not just about the dice you roll, itâ€™s about the actions the fictional characters take.<br/>
<br/>
So, see that you play your character well. Shoot some really strong lines at your lover. Not only will gift dice keep raining down on you from all sides, but also, you are giving your GM every reason to actually give before itâ€™s over. Just make sure your GM understands that itâ€™s perfectly okay to give even if heâ€™s in a good position, mechnically. For that, see my semi-rant: <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1917&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">Do you really believe in game systems so strongly?</a> </div>
