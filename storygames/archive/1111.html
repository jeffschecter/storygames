                    Here's a post from my blog that I thought I'd get SG feedback on:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Iâ€™ve been playing a couple of games lately that make good use of context menus, or context-sensitive actions. The Rainbow Six series is the first, utilizing a pie menu for things like opening doors and a simple context-sensitive action on the spacebar for movement like ladders. The second, and far more impressive implementation, is in Prince of Persia: Sands of Time. (Why yes, my computer game consumption tends to be about 2-3 years behind the curve.)<br/><br/>In Prince of Persia (PoP), the Prince is, to say the least, agile.  He can run along walls for short distances, run straight up walls and then jump off, do high-bar tricks and far more.  PoP is mostly a puzzle game - find the correct path through a sultanâ€™s palace, and execute the necessary moves, that has succumbed to demonic activity.  Now ordinarily this would be the last kind of game that youâ€™d find me playing - Iâ€™m not much for puzzle-jumpers (the last one I played was the original Tomb Raider).  But there are three things that make PoP very engaging (nay, immersive and addicting):<br/><br/>   1. The animation and graphics for the game are fluid, lush and atmospheric.<br/>   2. The controls are very forgiving, and respond reasonably well to fumbling idiots such as myself.<br/>   3. The puzzles are incremental and (at least at first) give you a lot of time to master each of the moves so that you can use it effectively.<br/><br/>These are all incredibly important - but what do they have to do with contextual action?  Well, most (almost all) of the special actions that you can do with the Prince are controlled with the right-click of the mouse and/or the spacebar.  The only thing thatâ€™s different about the moves is the context in which youâ€™re hitting the right-mouse button and/or spacebar.  For example, run parallel to a wall and right-click, you get a wall-run.  Run straight at the wall and mouse-click and you run straight up it, ending in a flipping flourish (or, more usually, hitting the spacebar at the end to then vault off the wall).  The variables involved are purely environmental - the direction and speed of the Prince is compared to the environment at the time of the right-click and the correct special action is executed.<br/><br/>This by no means makes the game easy.  Aside from camera-placement issues that always bedevil such games (once I found myself needing a different view of the situation I was in, clutching to a ledge several hundred feet above the ground, and the camera moved to a perfect view of the Princeâ€™s ass), and some control issues that are minor, timing and setting up the moves is difficult - but as I said, the game ramps you up for these sorts of challenges.<br/><br/>Thereâ€™s also the puzzle-solving factor - trying to figure out how to attack a given route.  Towards the middle of the game, your eye immediately starts to pick out the series of ledges and banner-staves that you need to ascend to get where youâ€™re going.  Figuring out how to start or where to go next is often tricky.<br/><br/>And so, context menus are by no means a static thing - contextual action can be dynamic and flow with the play of a game.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>Ok, so what now?  How does this apply to RPGs?<br/><br/>Consider for a minute that a large portion of a character sheet is devoted to combat statistics - but that these statistics often need to have extra calculation involved in order to achieve a result in the game.  What is present on a character sheet is the beginning of a series of contexts that could be broken up and presented to the player only when necessary.  Imagine (for D&amp;D for example) a series of cards (color coded): one has â€™standardâ€™ combat information.  Another has special maneuvers that the player can execute.  If a character is wounded (or knocked prone or in some other special circumstance), simply flip the card and there are all of the playerâ€™s options and stats laid out for them.<br/><br/>On a more universal scale - why not a separate card for each attribute, with derived statistics covering the range of options that the character has?  Going even larger - â€˜environment cardsâ€™ that provide global context for the action of the game - limiting action to social action unless certain conditions are met.  Or pulling context for entire campaigns from situations the GM has created for the area the characters are in and deriving options which are presented as another card in the playerâ€™s arsenal.<br/><br/>By breaking up the information presented, and giving complete information on each context, you can enrich the player experience by offering more options, enrich it by offering new and different options built from context, streamline it by providing easy access to the numeric/arithmetic side of all these options, and channel it by restricting contexts.                </div>

                            Awesome stuff.  There is a huge amount that we can learn from video games.<br/>
<br/>
Take Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. You start the game and walk up to a bike and get on. That's when the instructions for riding a bike appear.  You get into a car for the first time and instructions for driving the car appear. Jump off a building with a parachute for the first time and instructions for the parachute appear. Go to the gym for the first time and instructions for the gym appear. Fly a plane for the first time, etc. etc. etc.  There's probably a hundred things you can do in GTA:SA, and if you had to learn them all at one time it would be impossible.  Yet for some reason this seems to not have been nailed down to people in games. <br/>
<br/>
How much better would D&amp;D3 be/have been if there were pullout "combat cheat sheets" that said in clear big type "BULL RUSH" or "DISARMS"?  How much better would any game be in an unfamiliar setting if you had characters fed-ex mission around a little while like every console RPG ever? They're not just having you fight rats in the tavern basement and carry a package to Biff the Blacksmith, they're showing you the combat system and introducing you to the town.                        </div>

                            JD, introductory conflicts (as in Dogs first and lots more games recently) give this sort of game-tutorial thing.  It's not everything that you mentioned, but I think it's an important first step.                        </div>

                            I was recently thinking about games that would teach you how to play as you play, in exactly the way that you describe JD. I don't think I had made the connection in my head to video games until now. I agree with Josh that introductory conflicts are some of the first steps in this area.                        </div>

                            Oh, and Burning Wheel.  Its modular rule system allows you to start with basic dice rolls and then add in specific modules (Duel of Wits, Fight!, etc) as you go.                        </div>

                            Actually EN Publishing have released a <a href="http://shop.enworld.org/index.php?productsid=1781&amp;aid=1" rel="nofollow">set of cards</a> that do just that. I think it's a long overdue idea and one that I think would work for a lot of other games.<br/><br/>Wouldn't the best set of introductory rules be ones that you just picked up and played, and were laid out in the order you needed to know them? So you would start off by being taken through character creation, then some simple rules for skills or whatever, then a combat, and so on? So the rules themselves acted as an introductory adventure/tutorial?                        </div>
