Now this is what we\u2019ve got: you sleep in water and filth; you get some rotten biscuits to eat if you\u2019re lucky; you only get to go outside so the Sunlover Butchers can kill you; the only weapon you have is a rusty knife; all your so-called allies are all on \u2018The List\u2019; and the Chief whips you if you complain.<br/><br/>But you can fight back! Raiders sneak across the ploughed cuts the Earthcutting Sunlovers make in their fields to loot and pillage their farms. Marauders charge in and cut down Forestlurkers before they can sing their cursing song. Thieves sneak in quietly behind the Goldkissing Longbeards and snatch their purses as they slit their throats. Harriers rush<br/>in and steal the food off the table and are back out the door before the Fatbelly Hairytoes can swallow their mouthful and scream. Extortionists sit back quietly and rake in the valuables from their scams. Shamans curse them all with the ancient powers of secrets and fire.<br/><br/>This is what we\u2019ve got, yes. But what are you going to take and hide for yourself?</span><br/><br/>Just finished the latest version of <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?board=32.0" rel="nofollow">Goblin World</a>, my free Apocalypse World hack where you get to play evil little backstabbing goblins.
