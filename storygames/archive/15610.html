I love it in a creepy stalker kind of way though and when I find a song I like I usually listen to it almost exclusively for a week or so before I become numb to it and can archive it together with other songs that are neat but not mind consuming in the same way. I like background music in roleplaying games but it can't be too good or intrusive or it disrupts the game, plus there is a problem in that the GM usually set the music (because he sets most scenes in the games I play) and being a DJ is yet another thing to juggle (and just having a mix for a certain game do lead to the music not adding very much by not fitting the mood of the scene).<br/></sub><br/><br/>Enough exposition: have anyone ever had breaks for music? Like, play with no background music and then between scenes you play a single song to get people in the mood or just cool off after being creative/emotional or whatever. Maybe talking during the song is forbidden. Perhaps it can even be an aid to mental montages? Like: "yeah we are preparing for the heist, cleaning our guns but mostly doing coke off a kitchen table and high fiving when a cop dies in Heat on DVD" and then play something upbeat and people just close their eyes and imagine the montage. Shorter songs are probably better for this. Shit it could even be a way to represent travel and such, by tying different songs to stuff like space travel or boat travel or building/coding/searching something.<br/><br/>I'll try to experiment with this when I get time, do anyone have any experience or some good insight? I did use an intro song for a long campaign that had a big turnover of PCs to keep some sort of continuety.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353987/#Comment_353987" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T15:57:38+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  3:57PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I never thought of doing an interlude, but I've frequently done intro songs, where we listen to a song before we start playing.

(I too briefly used to be a DJ, back in the Madison-Milwaukee rave scene in the late 90s, and know the lure)<br/><br/>However, I don't think that "silence and contemplation while you listen to this track and imagine the scene unfold" would work. Well, also, experientially (we've tried this in the past, another GM was doing the songs though) it did not work. In brief, music is very subjective. Unless everyone's tastes are VERY MUCH IN LINE, then the exercise is pretty offputting.<br/><br/>However, when I stop a game and say "listen to this song and imagine your planning montage", then likely:<br/>1) I love the song, so I am enjoying myself and able to imagine a montage/scene easily.<br/>2) Another has heard the song before, and kinda likes it, so she listens too and "kinda" gets into it.<br/>3) A third has never heard the sond before, and maybe likes it, but he's so busy concentrating on the new sounds of this song (or the lyrics, if any) that no images come and it's a wasted exercise.<br/>4) Two people are bored because they don't particularly know or like the song, or don't find it fitting, but they politely remain silent.<br/>5) The last person hates the genre entirely and politely deals with it while imagining how fun it will be to actually get around to roleplaying again.<br/><br/>I've actually seen something like this in play, too: A friend GMed a dark fantasy Savage Worlds game, at one point "introduced the setting" audially through the use of the MP3 of the Conan the Barbarian soundtrack main theme. Even then, we all at least recognized and/or loved the song, but all had different takeaways: Mostly it amounted to people remembering the movie Conan the Barbarian and not really thinking at all about the goings-on. I loved the soundtrack back in the day, but was kind of bored and couldn't wait for it to be over to actually get to play.<br/><br/>But someone in the background spinning for us? Playing the Passion Soundtrack in a crowded market, then flipping to a slow ballad for combat, then a frantic epic song for the final sub-boss battle? That would be kinda cool IMO. Just not the GM, because that's too much handling, too much dicking around on the PC or iPod ("Hmm, where was that song again? One sec...")<br/><br/>Ribbon Drive does not count for the above statement, as it's the point of the game: Like, for example, I really want to play Ribbon Drive. See how music butts up and intersects with the other players and the narration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354065/#Comment_354065" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-12T09:48:11+00:00" title="January 12, 2012  9:48AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, you can come over and DJ a game for us any time.

I do a lot of gaming over Skype, and lately I've been wanting to break up the game with little musical flourishes.  Something on the order of 5-10 seconds each, orchestral.  I think it would be a great way to start and end games, to play right as combat is starting or completed, and for the occasional scene change (especially if lots of time passes).<br/><br/>What inspired me was a wonderful audio adaptation of The Hobbit, narrated by Nicol Williamson.  I listened to it as a child, and my children now listen to an MP3 version of it I found online.  Anyways, it has exactly these sort of musical flourishes, often haunting harp music.  I'd love to have the music separately, but I imagine there's zero chance of this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354093/#Comment_354093" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-12T14:12:41+00:00" title="January 12, 2012  2:12PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It would be so fun to have an in-game DJ.  shit.<br/><br/>In the mean time, our group tends to fire each other youtube links to songs for character themes, story themes, NPC themes, etc.  <br/><br/>The theme music for our BC-Woodland-Apocalypse was mostly Slayer.<br/>This time, we're sticking to London Grime / Early Dubstep with a little Merzbow thrown in for flavour.<br/><br/>I'd love to find a way to accurately switch songs around and stuff during the game but I just can't do it while I'm actually running the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
