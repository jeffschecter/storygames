the other thread do (where a traditional gamer's not playing or wanting to play indie games is attributed to mainly negative qualities---lack of imagination, a desire to stay the past, fear of change, etc). This analysis essentially says we don't get indie games because we still fundamentally are playing with GI Joes and dolls. To me that isn't really an analysis, it is an analogy meant to make indie gamers feel good about themselves at the expense of traditional gamers, and I feel it doesn't offer any real insight into why traditional gamers don't tend to play indie games (I think there are a lot of complex reasons for it that have to do with taste and preference, not a lack of intellect, imagination or maturity). It also falls apart because if you look at some of the more comprehensive systems out there or games where there is a lot of emphasis on things like optimization and RAW, it is pretty clear to me that those are examples of RPGs where people very much want a game. I don't think it is that indie gamers want to play games and traditional gamers want toys, they just have different attitudes about what rules contribute to play. Obviously there are important differences, I just don't think they are differences we can ascribe to character or quality of intellect.  <br/><br/>And just want to clarify here since posts like this can't convey tone. I am not trying to attack you or at all angry, I just think this off the mark in a way that isn't productive.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441789/#Comment_441789" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-21T01:44:56+00:00" title="January 21, 2015  1:44AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, I suppose I should check my tone, but my feeling toward "play" is not at all disparaging.

It's generalization in a way that's hard to prove, or even offer much in the way of evidence for, and it assumes that there's easily generalizable categories of where people fall. Let alone whether it's trivializing of one side or another (which to be clear, I'm not accusing you of. I'm just saying, it's been done before, and will be done again).<br/><br/>In any case, I also find the analogy not that convincing? I spent 3-4 hours a day playing basketball while growing up, and most of that time was playing in a structured game of basketball, or undertaking exercises in order to get better at that. Whether it was full-court, or 21, or Horse, a lot of that was just games. We did just hang out around and shoot sometimes, but the vast majority of basketball was a game.<br/><br/>Similarly, if we take one subsection of what I'm going to assume you'd lump into traditional play, people playing in the Pathfinder Society, players get goals through the modules, they get a large amount of tools that are defined in meaningful detail how they affect achieving those goals, and GMs are given defined obstacles to oppose them, as well as lots of guidelines on how to resolve vagueness or handle going off-track. At the end, if you achieve the goals, you get rewards!<br/><br/>If I look at tons of what you'd probably call story games, I've got clear calls to theme, and some resolution techniques, but the goals of the game are often more centered in things like "tell an interesting story using these tools". Often times, when there are conflicts, we might just resolve it through talking about it. That sounds like play!<br/><br/>Are improv games more games or more play?<br/><br/>I'm not saying that flipping it is actually better: I'm just saying I think it holds either way.<br/><br/>I'd hate for this to go in the "what is a game?" direction.

We were expecting him to come in at any moment. So, after a time, one of the players started speaking in character. We asked him a few questions; he started telling a story about some of his adventures. Eventually, we all started telling stories about our characters and asking each other questions.<br/><br/>It was one of the most fun nights we'd had in the whole campaign!<br/><br/>Were we playing a game we'd made up on the spot? Or "playing", in the sense of exploratory fun? Hard to say.<br/><br/>I do know, though, that a typical indie game designer (including myself) would want to slap some structure on that experience, make it repeatable, and make the fun parts more consistently achievable. It's a very valid goal, but it does limit the exploratory nature of the thing.<br/><br/>Comparing Legos to Hungry Hippos (for those who are familiar with the reference) as a metaphor for different types of RPGs is very apt, I think.<br/><br/>The line isn't quite as clear as the article is making it out to be (I don't think it's as simple as "trad games" versus "indie games", since both range all over the map), but there's definitely a continuum here which is interesting to think about. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441800/#Comment_441800" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-21T06:55:44+00:00" title="January 21, 2015  6:55AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2015 7:01AM by Dirk.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I also basically agree with all the comments made so far. I'm not sure how far we can go without getting mired in defining a "game," but I'd like to push as far as we can go with the definition presented, ie:<br/><br/>Non-game play - "Freedom from all but personally imposed rules, no goals."<br/>Game-play - "Externally imposed rules, goals."<br/><br/>I'm seeing the limitation of delineating between "traditional" and "indie." Better to say "things that imposes [procedural] rules and goals" and "things that don't." And I agree that there's a continuum between the two.<br/><br/>The point of drawing this delineation or continuum is that it provides multiple modes for evaluation. Something that seems poor when evaluated as a game may shine when evaluated as a toy, and vice versa. Awareness of these multiple modes of evaluation is another tool for designers, esp. with regard to presenting their design.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">@James_Stuart</a>, re: basketball: <br/>It's certainly most often played with in the context of game, but the basketball, hoop, and court don't prescribe procedure or goal. These toys suggest certain types of play, but the rules of the game are a fully separate entity, and can therefore be changed or iterated independently. Hence the multiple different games that have been developed using the same toys.<br/><br/>Likewise with Pathfinder/Society. Pathfinder can be used to play games, but the goals and procedures of those games are not prescribed by Pathfinder. Pathfinder can also be used for non-game play, or for game-play that is different from Pathfinder Society game-play. The game is external to the material found in the book.<br/><br/>Is this making any further sense? This is a very new idea to me, and I'll walk away from it if I have to, but I don't want to give up on it until I feel like I've expressed it clearly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441802/#Comment_441802" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-21T13:01:27+00:00" title="January 21, 2015  1:01PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2015 1:04PM by Rickard.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you heard of Keith Burgun?

Game engines are classified as toys.\n<blockquote>It\u2019s a toy. A toy provides a structure for play.</blockquote>\nI'm not really sure what you mean with this. You try to explain it in the same paragraph, but when I read what I quoted I think that, when you got a toy, you make up the structure of play while playing with it. Kids do that all the time with their games. "Now the floor is lava. Quick, jump up on the furnitures!" Sure, a toy <i>may</i> come with a structure of play, like football, but is that the nature of the toy? I think it's normally just an influence of what to do while playing. Like you said: "...but sometimes it\u2019s purely exploratory. A toy might constrain or suggest certain types of play, but it doesn\u2019t tell you what to do with it, or what the goal of your play should be.

I have to say in all honesty, as a non-indie player, when I see responses like that (and frankly I am heartened that the majority of people appear to disagree with the OP on this one) it makes me wonder if the person is at all capable of looking at games and rpgs without trying to establish a hierarchy that always places their preferred approach at the apex in some way. RPGs are toys doesn't seem like analysis to me at all. Again, I also think by doing that you fail to understand why games like D&amp;D are so popular (it certainly isn't because it is a toy). <br/><br/>Again, not trying to come across as angry or to insult over this. I just don't understand the need to frame it this way. It would be like if I kept trying understand why someone liked playing checkers, but insisted on analogies that compared checkers to things like learning to breastfeed or masterbation. I might not even intend to be insulting, but surely it is obvious that if those are my analogies, the person who likes chess and doesn't think of breastfeeding when he does it, is going to take exception. It isn't going to advance the conversation at all.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441806/#Comment_441806" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-21T13:42:03+00:00" title="January 21, 2015  1:42PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2015 1:45PM by Bedrockbrendan.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I agree with all the comments so far, in particular the comments which discuss how structured some "traditional" RPGs are (like a D&amp;D tournament) and how loose some "story games" are (e.g. Archipelago, Jeepform, etc.). <br/><br/>However, I do also think that this article points to something quite valid, actually. <br/><br/>I remember one of my fondest RPG sessions as a teenager was a D&amp;D game where we sat around a table, waiting for the DM to show up... and he never did. <br/><br/>But we didn't know that. We were expecting him to come in at any moment. So, after a time, one of the players started speaking in character. We asked him a few questions; he started telling a story about some of his adventures. Eventually, we all started telling stories about our characters and asking each other questions.<br/><br/>It was one of the most fun nights we'd had in the whole campaign!<br/><br/>Were we playing a game we'd made up on the spot? Or "playing", in the sense of exploratory fun? Hard to say.<br/><br/>I do know, though, that a typical indie game designer (including myself) would want to slap some structure on that experience, make it repeatable, and make the fun parts more consistently achievable. It's a very valid goal, but it does limit the exploratory nature of the thing.<br/><br/>Comparing Legos to Hungry Hippos (for those who are familiar with the reference) as a metaphor for different types of RPGs is very apt, I think.<br/><br/>The line isn't quite as clear as the article is making it out to be (I don't think it's as simple as "trad games" versus "indie games", since both range all over the map), but there's definitely a continuum here which is interesting to think about. <br/><br/></blockquote>\nI think the big dividing line between a lot of these different approaches is where the structure needs to be. But the freeform situation you describe isn't necessarily one that a all mainstream RPGs these days would support. For instance 3E has a lot of rules governing social interactions between characters. It doesn't take it to the level of social combat, but you have skills for things like Diplomacy and Bluffing. So there is a structure there if people want to use it. I've actually been in a lot of debates with people who play D&amp;D and Pathfinder about the subject of roleplaying and what it actually means (and here I mean Roleplaying in the sense of the playing your character in social or non-combat situations). Some people view it purely as speaking in character in the first person. Some view more as a third person activity. And others view it more as a simulation of a personality. Those are all viewpoints you will find within the mainstream and traditional RPG community. Some of those viewpoints are supportive of structure, some want more freedom. But even if you have someone like me who is entirely comfortable with freeform role-play, because I feel mechanics often do get in the way for how I like to deal with that, I like structure in other parts of the game and I like to follow the rules pretty closely. It is just for social interactions I feel it works better to simply have a good handle on your NPCs and play them accordingly (and for the PCs to do the same). <br/><br/>I think people might be picking up on the "rulings, not rules" sentiment and assume that means the GM should do whatever he wants just like a child on a playground who suddenly decides "we're doing this now". But it is important to keep in mind not everyone in the mainstream likes rulings not rules (there is a large contingent of RAW players who play 3E and pathfinder and 4E), and for those who do embrace it, there are some guidelines for how it is supposed to work. The way I use it, is I play the system RAW, but deviate from the system when a result it would produce strains plausibility or when the mechanic in question just fails to address the situation in a meaningful way. My next step is to try to use an existing mechanic in the system to address the situation (trying to extrapolate on something that already exists for example). This is "the GM as referee" approach. It isn't just the GM declaring things, he or she needs to build the trust of the players for that to work, and to build trust you have to work on the art of adjudication. For me it is begins with the notion of being fair to my players and being willing to admit when I make a bad call (and reverse that call). <br/><br/>So to me, labeling this a toy misses what is going on. If you want to compare that kind of play to something (and that is essentially all people are doing here is making analogies), then I would say it is more like a craft than a toy. But that doesn't make it less of a game. A big part of the excitement for me as a GM is not knowing what the outcomes will be. I like that I don't know how things are going to end, that the dice introduce twists and turns I never expected and that the players choices have weight. In the hands of a open minded and experienced GM, you can achieve that in traditional play.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441807/#Comment_441807" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-21T13:47:51+00:00" title="January 21, 2015  1:47PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think this is a real thing, but I don't think the article gets the taxonomy quite right.

I am just saying we can discuss those without putting one in a box that is filled with positive vibes and one in a box filled with negative vibes. If you are doing that, I have to question whether you really want to engage in analysis that has the goal of understanding what is going on. <br/><br/>So sure, story games and indie games tend to have more structures in place and greater focus on certain things. I do think you are right that many traditional gamers find indie approaches constricting because a lot of times they offer fixes for things that a traditional gamer just doesn't see as a problem.  \n<blockquote><br/><i>Without</i> passing judgment, I do think more games could benefit from being more explicit about how they are intended to be used.

Feel free to clarify this further if I do miss your concern. <br/><br/>One thing to understand here is people have very different views on what plot actually means in the context of an RPG. Some groups want a kind of story to emerge and the GM (as you say) to have a strong hand in making it happen) but that is a rarity among traditional gamers in my experience. Most groups I have been in, expect the GM to handle the set up, but want freedom to explore the situation and for the situation to develop organically around that. <br/><br/>Keep in mind many traditional games do just that. Lamentations of the Flame Princess (which I think is pretty traditional) is rather explicit in the GM section on how the game is meant to be played. A lot of games neglect this (and I have certainly been guilty of this at times) because they assume anyone buying it is already familiar with RPGs and knows the drill. Even the 1E DMG, if you read it through, gets pretty explicit about what kind of prep you are supposed to do, how the game is supposed to be run, and exploration and turn increment procedures for dungeons. The 2E DMG kind of backpedaled off that and had this weird blind spot where it didn't get into the details of prep and exploration, but 3E arguably went into this stuff in a lot of detail with its back to the dungeon approach. And it really gave a clear idea of how it saw play, prep and adventure in my view. <br/><br/>I think one of the reasons some rpgs don't address how the GM is supposed to handle things in explicit terms is because they want to leave that up to the individual group. Some people like plot, some people like exploration, some people like adventure paths, etc. If a game picks one approach, it limits its appeal. The assumption here I believe is a given group will already have its own way of handling this or arrive at one through various GM advice sources. <br/><br/>This touches on the issue that the broader the appeal of the game (D&amp;D would probably be an example here) the more of a blank slate you might want to be because any given game group is going to a diverse collection of preferences and tastes. I think this is the lesson from 4E. It did a very good job at appealing to a particular set of players, but in so doing alienated people like me. Genre emulation is fine for a niche game. My games are more traditional but within the traditional format we do a lot of genre emulation....but that means we are a bit niche in terms of appeal. I also love games that have a cool core conceit and focus on a particular kind of adventure (for example investigations or political intrigue). But the thing you run into with that stuff is most game groups are made up of 4-6 different people with wildly different tastes. I can have a much more successful long term campaign, if the core game doesn't insist on any particular kind of play and I am allowed to draw on all my players preferences to cobble together something everyone likes.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dirk" title="Dirk"><img alt="Dirk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dirk">Dirk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441811/#Comment_441811" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-21T16:39:04+00:00" title="January 21, 2015  4:39PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 21, 2015 4:43PM by Dirk.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a>, Thanks for the Keith Burgun referral, I was ignorant of him, but he nicely expresses this idea here:\n<blockquote>"Let me clarify these a bit, because some of these words might have connotations that I don\u2019t mean, but they\u2019re as close as I could get with the words I could find.<br/><br/>Toy \u2013 A Toy is any interactive system without a goal / problem to solve.

I also feel like I am asking why, and asking people here to ask questions about some of the assumptions they have. If every attempt to explain my tastes is going to be done using analogies that pretty much anyone would perceive as insulting, no amount of qualification of those analogies is going to help. I am not going to let the terms of the conversation be set in or framed in a way that paints what I like as infantile or lacking creativity. The OP created a questionable analogy.

I think that presenting a toy as a game pre-empts negotiation about how that toy will be played with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Airk" title="Airk"><img alt="Airk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Airk">Airk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441877/#Comment_441877" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-22T16:12:37+00:00" title="January 22, 2015  4:12PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            #1: No; I actually find that when I am given instructions as to what the product is supposed to do, I am inspired to do cool stuff with it, whereas if a product just drops a bunch of random ideas in my lap, I look at them, scratch my head, and go "So... what is this supposed to do?"<br/><br/>#2: You can probably infer by my answer to <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, that at this point in my life, I find products that don't explain what they are for to be next to useless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441878">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441878/#Comment_441878" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-22T16:43:02+00:00" title="January 22, 2015  4:43PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't think that an individual's play will necessarily be more various with more toy-like products.

Since a toy doesn't prescribe how you play with it, each person's play will be different.<br/><br/>There are other factors that shape toy-based play, though, that might make it more consistent. Like "how have I seen this toy played with?" or "what is the culturally enforced mode of play for this toy?"<br/><br/>For example, I think there's a strong culturally enforced mode of play for the Piano. There's lots of ways to play with a piano, and kids often try them out--usually stifled by an adult saying "that's not how we play with the piano."<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441889">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441889/#Comment_441889" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-22T18:11:17+00:00" title="January 22, 2015  6:11PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the poster child for, "this is a toy, not a game, and that actually means something," is Call of Cthulhu.<br/><br/>I know some folks have strong feelings about that game, so I'll make another thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441891">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441891/#Comment_441891" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-22T18:12:14+00:00" title="January 22, 2015  6:12PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I think the poster child for, "this is a toy, not a game, and that actually means something," is Call of Cthulhu.<br/><br/><br/>I know some folks have strong feelings about that game, so I'll make another thread.</blockquote>\nPlease do.

Since a toy doesn't prescribe how you play with it, each person's play will be different.</blockquote>\nI come to think of <b>Lady Blackbird</b>, that sets up some background, a kicker and a vague goal, but how the game is played and where it will end will differ depending on the group and its individuals.<br/><br/>I would say that Lady Blackbird is a clear example of a toy.\n<blockquote>There are other factors that shape toy-based play, though, that might make it more consistent. Like "how have I seen this toy played with?" or "what is the culturally enforced mode of play for this toy?"</blockquote>\nI seldom play (regular) card games with people who knows to play cards. Not that I don't think it's funny if the opposition is good, it's not about that. It's about them having their own house rules. No matter whom I play with, that person's family will always have their own house rules.

So far Rickard is the only one who has really mentioned it, and it's generally an important point of distinction.<br/><br/>Let's also not forget the difference between diegetic and non-diegetic goals.  "DayTrippers" (for instance) is very much a set of tools with no overarching procedural instruction and no particular diegetic goal; that's because I expect the players and GM to create those themselves.  The GM does it in prepping adventures, and the players do it through character identification and projection, and it will roll out in a different way for every group.<br/><br/>"Fiasco" also has no particular diegetic goal before play begins, but one develops for each character as play continues.  <br/><br/>But both games <i>do</i> have a non-diegetic goal, and it is the same for both games - in fact it's the same for all of the games we've discussed here.  That goal is <i>to collaboratively create a series of events which exhibits or emulates certain aspects of narrative</i> - and this is true regardless of genre, playstyle or label.<br/><br/>Toy or game?<br/><br/>Mu.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442030/#Comment_442030" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-26T06:43:43+00:00" title="January 26, 2015  6:43AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2015 6:45AM by Paul_T.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This strikes me as a relevant older discussion:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/280767" rel="nofollow">The Wind-up Toy School of Game Design</a><br/><br/>(It's particularly interesting because it's mainly people who - I would argue - are considered hardcore "story gamers", talking about the downsides of designing games which are, er, "games" by the standards of this thread.
