The question of whether to make the color an important part of the rules?  I'm veering away from that specifically in this instance (at present) but would normally advocate for setting-rich rules sets as the added color helps to sell the game and give context through which to interpret the rules.<br/><br/>Take DitV which is ostensibly about Mormon missionaries but just as often, if not more often, has the setting hacked to create alternative paladins and use of the mechanics.  I suspect Vincent decided to skin it with "Dogs" because it's an easier sell than strictly playing Mormon pioneers; and then too why people often keep the righteous Dog but slough off the overt religious notes in favor of fuzzier idealism.  It's easier to pervert a concrete example than generate from scratch.<br/><br/>I haven't read Solar System (the document needed heavy editing when i sat down to give it a gander) but continue to hear great things.  Justin Jacobsen has been working on a really clean pared-down d20 mechanic that looks nice too.  But often, for me, looking at the math is less enticing than say... taking Geiger Counter and stripping out the horror and adding a different kind of conflict because there's plenty of text that illustrates how the horror acts at different points in the rules document.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230610/#Comment_230610" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T12:08:54+00:00" title="September  8, 2009 12:08PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2009 1:22PM by Josh Roby.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the Indiesphere, there is already <em>Primetime Adventures</em> and <em>Universalis</em>, not to mention <em>The Pool</em>.  Additionally, absolutely everything that has ever been released has been hacked to run some other sort of setting.  Also remember that games sell on the strength of the premise of their setting.  Games do not, I swear to you, sell on the strength of their clever dice gimmick.  So designing a game without setting has to: (a) be better or otherwise distinguish itself from PTA, Uni, and Pool and <em>every other game designed</em>, as well as (b) get marketed and picked up without a setting to get it attention.

So, my currents designs have suddenly become scalable and setting-less. This because I love to cater to my players and whatever genre interests they have.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'd stress, though, is that the way the rules work with heavily influence how you and the players view the fiction.

There are lots of settings that can touch on that theme...that's why its so easy to reskin Dogs...the setting color is all faux Mormons in the faux west but the rules aren't tied to that at all (except for a few very easily substituted places like the Coat).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to design a game about down and out common people facing off against an implaccable and largely faceless foe you can tie your mechanics to that theme in a way that really reinforces the feel you're going for.  After that its a simple matter to find various points in history or fictionally where down and out common people face off against and implaccable foe and fill in the setting color as desired.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrimetime Adventures, The Pool, and Universalis take a different approach.  They provide nothing but mechanical structure, no setting color, and no thematic tie-in at all.  At which point, see Josh's comments above...if you're going to reinvent that wheel you'd better do something really special with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230640/#Comment_230640" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T14:10:12+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  2:10PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2009 2:11PM by Elizabeth.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's Complicated also doesn't have a setting; it's a system for telling a certain type of story about a certain type of character, and those types of stories and characters exist in every genre.

I think the reason Dogs or whatever is so easily "skinnable" is because the default setting creates a frame of reference for what the game is suppose to look like in action. Or to maybe put it another way, the default setting creates a template of sorts that makes it easier to imagine new settings. I think divorcing a rules set from a setting actually makes it harder to imagine new settings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230665/#Comment_230665" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T16:03:00+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  4:03PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Yeah, I think the key to designing successful generic story games is not to tie the the mechanics to the color of a specific setting but to tie them to the color of a specific theme. </blockquote>\nI feel the same way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230731/#Comment_230731" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-09T00:28:07+00:00" title="September  9, 2009 12:28AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always have trouble coming up with a setting for my games.

Among recent releases, NWoD is structured in this way. There are the multifarious descendants of D&amp;D3.x too, True20 and friends. Gumshoe is agnostic with regard to setting.<br/><br/>Then there are the games that are released attached to settings but keep getting re-attached to new settings. Burning Wheel spun off Burning Empires and Mouse Guard, new games that keep a recognizable core of their parent; Vincent hacked Dogs into Afraid, but kept most of the mechanics of his older game. My earlier example of Lady Blackbird into Bloody Forks of the Ohio is relevant here. And then there is Sorcerer with its many third-party resettings, and InSpectres with its.<br/><br/>So I think that maybe people do write abstract systems, but generally want to offer a "complete" product to the public, so they include setting stuff and tie it closely to the rules. No one is standing around to make sure that you run Dogs in a West that never was, right? <br/><br/>Your idea, that GURPSesque games that ship with zero setting are obsolete, might be the right path to explore. As soon as I see the supplement treadmill taking shape, I run away. I suspect I'm not alone in that.

On that score, Dust Devils is one indie example: it has its "base" setting of the Old west, but the back two sections show how to totally drift it into (IIRC) a spy game or a cyberpunk game. This approach is really no different than Champions, though the Hero System is presented (lately) standalone.<br/><br/>That said, there's genre and there's setting. The "high fantasy" that's Fantasy Hero is not the same scope or scale as MERP's setting. Ditto for Champions versus With Great Power: both are "modern supers" but the former has a canonical setting with persistent characters and factions across multiple supplements.<br/><br/>The small-press and indie scene doesn't seem to take that approach often, but it's not a "dead" concept ([plug]see GLASS[/plug]).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

Take everyone's favorite example, DitV---the situation is that the Dogs, as inexperienced as they are, represent the all-powerful moral authority of the land, and it's their job to keep the order, one way or another. You CAN NOT change that without fundamentally changing the game. (This is why it's so easy to imagine using DitV for Stars Wars, because they both involve powerful moral authorities in a landscape of semi-independent communities.) Trying to use the DitV ruleset to play a bunch of bureaucratic pinons who mindlessly follow orders would change the game into something else.<br/><br/>This is why I think it's often better to include a default "setting".

It's got Drives and rules for investigation, and play is focused on those things. But the kinds of Drives, and the classes of mysteries to investigate, can vary widely, and lead to very different kinds of stories told. Are we talking about morbid obsession Driving characters to delve into Lovecraftian Mysteries Man Was Not Meant To Explore? Or about mercenary honor Driving them to investigate the erratic behavior of the sick millionaire's eldest daughter? Gumshoe supports both.

I like Near.  It wasn't what sold me the game (Clinton Nixon is what sold me the game) but it gave me enough substance to recognize I was going to like it and enough guidance so I could understand why the rules work the way they did.<br/>\n<br/>\nCompare and contrast that to what Eero's done with Solar System...which is pretty much strip out everything Near and put it in a seperate book.  Now I probably would have picked up Solar System from Eero's name alone...but I'm not sure I'd have any idea at all what to do with it if I hadn't encountered Shadow of Yesterday first.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving the Solar System rules already purged from Near I think makes the Solar System booklet a good design tool for a Game Designer wanting to publish their own game using that system...or a GM who is really into "building a campaign" the way we used to back in the day.  But if all's I had was the Solar System booklet with no Shadow of Yesterday and no Near...I don't think I would ever possibly considering running it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe setting makes the rules clearer in a way that I don't think mere examples could do.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow Eero has released the Book of Near which is nothing but applying the Solar System rules to a setting (which happens to be the very setting the Solar System was ripped from to begin with); but I think that model might work well for what you are trying to do with Glass.  Especially if one comes free with the other.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if I've got my Book of Raw Glass Rules over here...but then I've got my Classic Vampire Boffer LARP game "powered by Glass" over there...I can see the rules really truly in action in the Vampire setting book realize "hey, I could totally hack this into doing a Flash Gordon Space Boffer LARP" and then go to the Raw Rules to get me started.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut trying to imagine doing a Flash Gordon Space Boffer LARP from the raw rules alone...based on my experience with The Solar System, I suspect I'd have trouble getting there.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that help?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231249/#Comment_231249" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T12:47:37+00:00" title="September 10, 2009 12:47PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>So, OK, again: is or is it not sufficient to provide copious examples of play in a variety of genres, and tools for GMs to tune to particular themes, and a few ready-to-run settings... or is this going to become The Epidiah Principle: there must be a "canonical" setting, even if your system easily drifts to other settings or genres with the same theme(s)?<br><br>If not, what does that tell us about flexible system presentation in rules text?<br><br>believe me...

What seems true to me may not apply to other fish and other puddles. I should also point out that I enjoy coming up with setting material. That's fun for me. Which has two vaguely contradictory implications on the current discussion:<br><br>1. From Time &amp; Temp on, I'm probably going to have a default setting in all my games. I just enjoy coming up with them and, for reasons already hit upon, it can only help matters.<br><br>2. As a consumer, I'm attracted to games that <i>don't</i> have a pre-packaged setting. I bought Solar System because flipping through it made my mind explode with possibilities.<br><br>It's strange, but in this particular case, I'm not my own audience, and that's something I have to contemplate.

If you've got the "campaign build" drive, it costs you zip to run a GLASS game (it SHOULD be runnable in its current System Test Document format, though perhaps only by experienced LARP GMs with exposure to Hero System).<br><br>BUT, if you buy the full book, you'll have tons of examples, sidebar digressions on how to tweak Abilities or why use Ability A to do Some Spell versus Ability B, and (say) five or ten setting in the Appendices that already have "Packages" (think races and classes) and "Templates" (think spells and powers and skills) and a specific style of setting (I don't want to do "vanilla" settings at all--each one will have a weird skew from the standard motifs) and you can just GO PLAY! And, again, your players really only need the shotGLASS rules in-game, to learn Calls and action sequencing and so forth--the system.<br><br>So on the one hand, I got the Epis of the world happy: here's the bones, start skinning (shotGLASS). On the other hand, I got the soft or hard cover book on Lulu (or wherever) that is BOTH ready to run as a setting AND all you need to start skinning bones, building your own game themes, and writing up Packages and Templates. IDEALLY, even, each setting will demonstrate another nuanced manner in which Priority and Options/Toggles interact to inform theme and tone. So, in THAT way, you also get that third ideal, where you not only see how it works with Theme A, but with Themes B through G... any of whose settings could be recolored to different genres (your Vamp -&gt; Flash drift).<br><br>It sounds like, from the whole thread above, this straddles all the "reader preferences" for approach to generic system: You DO get a few splat books right out the gate, but you DON'T have to buy any if you want to do all the work, AND each splat shows yet another way to tune the system. I feel confident... that it will either rock or will seem schitzoid ("What the fuck GAME is this, anyway? It's like every LARP mashed into one"--which it, ideally, CAN'T be because of Priority and Options/Toggles; but some folks skimming it might get that impression).<br/>\xa0\xa0[/wall of text]<br/>\xa0[/shill]<br/>[/apologia]                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231540">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231540/#Comment_231540" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T04:47:47+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  4:47AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2009 4:48AM by DanielSolis.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm coming from a different background here, but I think some basic principles still apply.<br/><br/>I like making abstract two-player board games. Games with simple rules and emergent complexity, but don't technically require a lot of setting or theme to them. Having written and/or tested about at least a dozen of these kinds of games, I've found that applying even a superficial theme to these rules makes them much easier for other people to learn and remember.<br/><br/>Thus, the "purpose" of a setting, or at least one of the purposes, is to serve as a metaphor for what you're supposed to do in play. For example, in Agon you hold your defense and attack dice in different hands, just as you would a sword and shield. Or in Steal-Away Jordan, where your dice pool corresponds to your value as a slave. Or in John Wick's little Ninja game, which uses only d4s because they are "the deadliest of all dice."<br/><br/>That, to me, is the primary value of having some kind of default setting for a core system. It lets you commit to a running example early in the text that can be continually referenced throughout and can serve as a mnemonic device for how to play the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231655/#Comment_231655" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T09:43:58+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  9:43AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>Thanks, guys, for the replies.<br/><br/>So, Ralph and Epi, here's the gig...</blockquote>\nIt's pretty much that exact setup that got me interested in D&amp;D again when third edition first came out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231674/#Comment_231674" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T10:12:35+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 10:12AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2009 10:13AM by Wordman.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">[cite]Posted By: Jared A.

All those books you were using were <i>products</i>. Some of these products might have thought they were games, and the game you were playing might have even resembled what was in the product, but they are two different things.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me this thread is about what types of products work for people (for some definition of "work").<br/>\n<br/>\nProducts that work for me are those that legibly describe <i>how</i> they work. Most products do this by example, showing how the game is used in a particular setting, suggesting a particular game. Some don't realize they are doing this, instead thinking they are really the game itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is useful but, realizing the difference between product and game, I wonder if there might be other types of product, not currently being produced, that might be useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne might be something that not only describes mechanics, but details how they actually work at the table, both psychologically and mathematically, with tweaks like "if you want this effect at the table, change this, otherwise, do this".<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother might be product containing chapters of rules, followed by <i>multiple</i> settings, each highlighting a different strength of the mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, we've seen a lot of products that say "here's how you can play the kind of game I am playing". I'm much more interested in products that say from the start "here are how some tools work to build your game". I, and I think most people, actually use products as if they did the latter anyway, but you don't often see the product helping you do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231678/#Comment_231678" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T10:19:28+00:00" title="September 11, 2009 10:19AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wordman</cite>tweaks like "if you want this effect at the table, change this, otherwise, do this".<br><br>Another might be product containing chapters of rules, followed by<em>multiple</em>settings, each highlighting a different strength of the mechanics.</br></br></blockquote>Awesome!

But I believe this type of game is actually pretty rare.

Anyways, I have to disagree with this:\n<blockquote>"IME, "generic" games like GURPS simply leave a hole in the situation front that the players have to figure out for themselves."</blockquote>\nGames with tight settings feel like holes with sharp edges into which I'm oblidged to fall. I don't mind <i>playing</i> them, but running a game with a tight setting just doesn't do it for me. I've tried it, but pretty much all the games I have run in pre-made settings have approached it somehow edge-on.<br><br>Coming up with a concept, and watching it GO is immensely satisfying. Why let someone else have that fun when you can have it yourself? Figuring out how rules work to sustain things, on the other hand, can be an immense drain of time and effort -- one that I'm more than happy to outsource.<br><br>I'd <i>love</i> to read a "Big Book of Indie Mechanics", or something of that stripe: collect mechanics from umpteen indie games, strip out the splats, the crunch and the setting -- or relegate them to a half-page example.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
