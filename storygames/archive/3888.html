Its run by a wargame society, but they made the mistake of listing RPGs in their events, so I'm crashing the party with a few indie games.  I plan on roping in a few strangers to show them the awesome of either <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i>, <i>Inspectres</i> or <i>Lacuna</i> (based on which game the aforementioned strangers have the most interest in).  Sunday morning I'll be playing some Necessary Evil (yay) whilst Mrs. Ork enjoys the miniature "take and paint" event (nothing as calming as painting a mini).  Plus, I'll be pimping my podcast.<br/><br/>Wish me luck..                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87431/#Comment_87431" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T21:08:42+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  9:08PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good luck, man.

I didn't make it there Saturday night, so I didn't get to demo anything for anyone (dangit, stupid real life).  I did make it there Sunday morning and the wife painted Reaper minis while I gamed.<br/><br/>I got into a game of Necessary Evil (a supers game in the Savage Worlds system).  The GM was very witty and engaging, but he also steamrolled over a couple player actions.  I kind of turtled a bit to get the vibe of the system and to avoid talking over some of the louder players, but I snuck in some retorts and played my character pretty well (my pregen was the one the GM told me he iked best).  After the game, I chatted the GM up about NE (a game he says he loves dearly) and asked him if he'd ever heard of Inspectres, which he hadn't.  <br/><br/>I told him I felt like the sense of humor of the game might match his style.  He then retorted, "I don't always run funny games." as if I was denegrating his GM-style.  I tried to smooth it over, complimented his wit and then pitched Inspectres as a Ghostbusters-style RPG.  He replied, "Ghostbusters the RPG, I've played that."<br/><br/>So I tried to explain that Inspectres was a different game that allowed players to describe their success while the GM describes the failures, so there's lots of collaboration.  He quirked his head, so I threw in that it was easy to prep because as the players succeed, their successes also build towards the resolution, so in effect, the GM only has to devise the introduction and then roll with it.  His interest waned for some reason.  I couldn't peg why, but before I got a chance to probe, someone interrupted us and we went to play some hoverboard racing game.<br/><br/>This was my first attempt to pimp an indie game in front of a live person.  I have to say it was harder than I thought.  Perhaps I should have described the game as awesome and rocking... I'm not sure.  I look forward to picking the brains of the SG crowd at GenCon so I can evangelize better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87979/#Comment_87979" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T06:57:37+00:00" title="August 14, 2007  6:57AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actual play is the best sales technique.  Don't explain why it is different; sit down and play.  It's really hard to make "you know the outcome of a conflict before it is played out!" compelling, because on the face of it that's a stupid idea (I'm thinking about Grey Ranks).  But sit down and try it, and it all makes sense and is fun.  <i>Then </i>you can talk about what an interesting and/or weird technique it is, if you want, grounded in actual experience.  <br/><br/>Let's talk at Gen Con!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
