I've only GM'ed traditional RPGs before, and these two guys have played exclusively DnD 3.0 &gt; 3.5 &gt; Pathfinder. I'm not terribly worried about any of us adapting to more narrative mechanics, these are guys who've been looking for something a little more character/story based for a while, they just haven't known where to look.<br/><br/>For my part, I've read the text a couple of times, printed out all the play aids, and run some quick conflicts for myself to make sure I know and can teach the mechanics. I've also generated my first town from the ruleset, but I made what feels like a deviation from the basic creation process, and I wanted to get some feedback from seasoned Dogs.<br/><br/><b>So, what's your advice for a first time GM?</b> Any huge common pitfalls I can be aware of or get ready to avoid? I'm taking the Play the Town and Don't Plan the Story advice to heart, but what am I probably ignoring?<br/><br/>And if'n y'all have the time and inclination, I'd love some feedback on my town, in the next post here.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/entropyblues" title="entropyblues"><img alt="entropyblues" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thejosefkstories.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/cropped-josefkbridge.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/entropyblues">entropyblues</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355918/#Comment_355918" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T11:21:33+00:00" title="January 25, 2012 11:21AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Sweetwater Crossing</b><br/><br/><b>Alice</b> - A charismatic widow, who has against odds, held onto and runs her late husbands prosperous orchard.<br/><b>Samuel</b> - A widower, runs the day to day labor of the farm, and is having a relationship of mutual comfort with Alice.<br/><br/><b>Lavinia</b> - Older sister to one to the PC Dogs, Fiery and spurned<br/><b>Amos</b> - Lavinia's husband, and laborer on the Orchard.

I welcome all thought and feedback, I'm not married to any of this. )<br/><br/><i>1a Pride </i>- <b>Alice</b> and <b>Samuel</b> are having a relationship without thought of marriage, and Alice is defensive of her status as Landowner. <b>Amos</b> desires the widow Alice, at the expense of Lavinia. <b>Matthias</b> sees Alice as the true authority of the town, not <b>Eli</b><br/><br/><i>1b Injustice </i>- <b>Lavina</b> is left alone with their teenage son, as Amos spends all his time near Alice's Orchard. <b>Eli's</b> authority is degraded by Amos, Samuel, and Matthias's reverence for Alice.<br/><br/><i>2a Sin</i> - (Here's where it get's hairy) Two weeks prior, Caleb and Carmine, the meanest Dogs in Deseret arrived in town. It didn't take long for them to talk to Eli, and decide Alice was the linchpin of the whole burgeoning heresy, and decided to kill her. Matthias overheard this conversation, and warned Amos and Samuel. When Caleb and Carmine cane to the Orchard one night, Samuel, Amos, and Matthias were waiting on the road. One thing led to another, and wanting to protect Alice, they killed both the Dogs. They buried them in a box canyon, sent the horses free, and vowed never to speak of it. But that didn't happen. Matthias first, and Samuel second realized that the Steward and the Dogs were in the wrong to judge Alice, and their trust in the appointed leaders of the Faith is gone. Alice knows nothing about the murders.<br/><br/><i>2b Demonic Attacks </i>- Eroding trust in the Appointed of the Faith. In the weeks since, Brother Eli has been made to look a fool by both fate, and the talk of Matthias and Samuel. It's gotten far enough that they openly mocked him after a sermon for some minor offense. Alice on the other hand, is well liked by all but Lavinia, and people are talking about her strength.<br/><br/><i>3a False Doctrine</i> - "Just because the Temple appoints you, don't mean your worthy. True authority comes from noble and faithful individuals." Matthias and Samuel. And very soon, Amos. We haven't got to outright corrupt worship, just the disruption of Eli's authority, but it's oh so close.<br/><br/><i>Wants</i><br/><br/><b>Alice</b> wants the Dogs to restore harmony to the town, under Eli. She respects Eli, and she wants Lavinia to stop hating her, or at least stop giving her the evil eye. But she does not want to be judged for her relationship to Samuel, which she views as completely acceptable, or to have her position of relative power judged just because she's a woman.<br/><br/><b>Steward</b> Eli wants the Dogs to restore his authority, and to at the very least, embarrass Samuel and Matthias. He suspects they're involved in the Dogs disappearance, and although he did not want Alice to be killed, he'll tell the PCs his suspicions if it will rid him of Samuel and Matthias. <br/><br/><b>Lavina</b> wants the Dogs to judge Alice, and judge her hard. Wants them to return Amos' affection to her.<br/><br/><b>Samuel</b> wants the Dogs to leave. Right now. He doesn't want to kill again, but he will protect Alice at all cost. He does not them to even think about judging him. What he did was hard, but right. Caleb and Carmine were thugs masquerading as authority. <br/><br/><b>Amos</b> wants the Dogs to find out about the murders, but does not want to tell them directly. He wants them to tell him he did a good thing and wants Eli, and the late Caleb and Carmine judged as sinners by the Dogs (Who else would conspire to kill Alice?), and a new authority established. <br/><br/><b>Matthias</b> wants to drive off or if need be, kill the Dogs. They're all one in the same, false authority figures who poison the true Faith of individual righteousness. He's on a hair trigger, and once the Dogs are gone, he can continue to undermine Eli.<br/><br/><b>The Demons</b> want the Dogs to act foolish, embarrass each other and the Steward, but most importantly, they want the Dogs to disagree.

I don't think it adds anything that plain old hate won't, and it will cause your players to roll into town defensive and ready for some murderin'. If you feel like you need murder in the mix make it a local.<br/><br/>The guys who just want the Dogs to go away - that's weak tea. There's no interesting choice to be made about a guy who comes at you immediately with a gun. What if they want to be forgiven, or supported by the Order Set Apart? They don't think they are wrong. If you remove the previous Dog murder it gives the players more moral ambivalence to work with.<br/><br/>Remember that they are going to make some choices, and the very very best gift you can give them (and yourself) is a lot of reasonable potential choices. Could a reasonable person side with every position in this town? If so, that's gold.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/entropyblues" title="entropyblues"><img alt="entropyblues" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thejosefkstories.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/cropped-josefkbridge.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/entropyblues">entropyblues</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355926/#Comment_355926" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T12:00:47+00:00" title="January 25, 2012 12:00PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Regarding the previous Dogs, yeah, I was already feeling like it didn't fit, but I needed to hear it.<br/><br/>It was the first idea I had, before town creation, A Big Ol' Plothook (old habits die hard). By the time I made the town by the book, I felt like that thread never quite gelled with the rest of the characters and motivations. The plus side is, it will be easy to remove.<br/><br/>I'm not certain I need murder in there at all, if that's the case, and the rest seems to knit together nicely: Eli, at the urging of Lavina and his own concerns, has been outspoken against Alice's postion of power and the men that flock to her, but it's backfired, as people are more willing to side with Alice, as she brings the most to the town. The discord is being driven on by the farmhands, not Alice herself, as I want to avoid a potential Lady Macbeth problem. And I don't think I need Matthias, the potentially violent one, at all at that point. There's already enough seething between the Farmhands and Eli, and Lavinia and Alice.<br/><br/>If I feel the need to nudge it a little bloodier, I suppose I can have Lavinia's teenage son, or Lavinia herself make a move toward killing or threatening Alice, and just use the conflict example from the book as a template for that. With Lavina being one of the PC's sister, that'll be gravy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355930/#Comment_355930" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T12:29:44+00:00" title="January 25, 2012 12:29PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well if you take out the previous Dogs then you need to clarify what the Sin is in the town. Luckily you have put some Sin under the Pride heading -- sex outside of marriage, etc. -- but I think it would be a good idea to clarify how the different parts connect, now that there is no longer a Major Violent Murder to serve as a catalyst for all these other wrongs.<br/><br/>Personally I think you might want to come up with some other events (even if they aren't as dramatic as a murder) that have resulted from Eli's undermined authority -- conflicts between Lavinia (or her son) and the orchard labourers, or directly between Alice and Eli, or Alice and Lavinia. Other reasons for people to be on edge, and eager to seek out the Dogs (or avoid them in a super-obvious way), or even just things that the NPCs will be able to talk about or point to as evidence for their side of things.<br/><br/>Consider that right now almost all the 'What does this NPC want?' stuff is directly related to the murders, which you are planning on removing. I think there's enough other things there for some of the NPCs with just the whole love triangle/sex stuff, but it might help if Eli has another relation in town or if there was some sort of dust-up at the orchard among the labourers, or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355954">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/entropyblues" title="entropyblues"><img alt="entropyblues" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thejosefkstories.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/cropped-josefkbridge.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/entropyblues">entropyblues</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355954/#Comment_355954" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T14:45:47+00:00" title="January 25, 2012  2:45PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was more difficult than I expected to excise the murdered Dogs thread, and I had to tug around and add a couple elements.

The fire in the orchard is a perfect fit. It cements the orchard laborers and Alice against the other side of the town, because it's <i>so obviously</i> the work of Eli and Lavinia's followers. And for their part, it's a <i>clear</i> sign from the King of Life that Eli and Lavinia were in the right all along. It galvanizes both sides against each other.<br/><br/>Thanks again, I feel like I'm just about ready to run this sucker.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355980/#Comment_355980" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T17:48:31+00:00" title="January 25, 2012  5:48PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 25, 2012 7:35PM by jenskot.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please feel free to ignore. Here's what I would do:<br/><br/>- I wouldn't make Lavinia the older sister of one of the PCs.<br/><br/>- Instead I would give the PCs a list of all the town's NPCs (with brief descriptions) and ask them: Who do you know? How? Maybe require everyone to have at least 1 relationship with any NPC. Maybe instead of asking "who do you know" ask provocative questions like: Who did you judge harshly but were wrong about? Who's your older sister? Who trained you? Who do you love? Who do you hate? Who do you respect? Who do you owe a favor? Who knows your secret? The faithful is a very small community. It's not uncommon for people to be tightly connected. <br/><br/>- You describe Lavinia as "fiery, clever, and spurned" but many of the other NPCs lack these descriptions. I would give each NPC 3 words or phrases that describe them. Maybe 1 positive, 1 negative, and 1 quirky. Maybe grab a picture from IMDB to represent each NPC. <br/><br/>- I would start off the first scene with Matthias beating Timothy. But you probably need some sort of reason that keeps the Dogs from immediately siding against Matthias as the situation is a bit one sided. <br/><br/>- At the same time, have some sort of commotion occurring at the church, maybe a mob of people questioning the Stewards authority. If you want to go even crazier, at the same time show smoke and fire emanating from the orchard. Maybe someone tries (but fails) to burn down Alice's property.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/entropyblues" title="entropyblues"><img alt="entropyblues" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thejosefkstories.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/cropped-josefkbridge.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/entropyblues">entropyblues</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356040/#Comment_356040" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-26T09:09:18+00:00" title="January 26, 2012  9:09AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll never ignore good advice.

You already have what you need! Just keep the list of what every NPC wants from the Dogs in front of you and use that as your guide.<br/><br/>But how do wants turn into conflict?<br/><br/>- At the first chance possible, have your NPC confront the Dogs.<br/><br/>- They want to be the first to ask / bed / demand that the Dogs give them what they want.<br/><br/>- Conflict will arise naturally if your NPCs are afraid, desperate, angry, panicking, or paranoid. But what make your NPCs act this way? <br/><br/>- Time is running out. They need to convince the Dogs before someone else does. Mobs are starting to form. The town is splitting into sides. Demonic attacks are increasing. People's livelihoods are threatened. But most importantly...<br/><br/>- NPC know who the Dogs are. They've heard what Dogs do. Maybe not these specific Dogs but others. Maybe sometimes the Dogs judge fairly. Maybe they judge the wrong person (or you think they were the wrong person). Maybe innocent people get hurt in the Dogs path of unleashing judgement. Maybe, given how powerful the Dogs are, they will take away what's yours. Take away your job, your family, your respect, your life. They have that power. And they WILL USE IT! Maybe Dogs in general are fine people. But maybe this is these Dogs first Town. Maybe they don't know what they are doing but think they do. Who will pay for their mistakes? YOU WILL! That's enough to make any NPC act crazy around the Dogs.<br/><br/>- Go the dice early and often. Trust the mechanics, they were specifically engineered to encourage and motivate you to escalate. Or give up, take your 2 highest dice, and then escalate in your next conflict. The dice will help you!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356075/#Comment_356075" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-26T12:49:42+00:00" title="January 26, 2012 12:49PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You've got the conflict cooking pretty well. Have the NPCs push their agendas hard, and it shouldn't be a problem. If the Dogs arrive, and don't have a clear direction (e.g. "Go visit my sister" or "Pass out the mail"), have an NPC come running up and tell them about their very urgent problem and desires.<br/><br/>If the Dogs do have an immediate goal, even if it's one that will drive story (e.g. "Go check in with the Steward"), have an NPC come running up to them anyway!<br/><br/>I like jenskot's ideas of asking questions. But go ahead and force them if you want. You can always ask "Who's a sibling to Lavinia?"  Set up the relationships you want to exist.  Don't ask open ended questions if you want specific answers. Though, those are great when you want to make more relationship connections, and don't have any specific needs (or they've been filled).  Another way to ask would be "Who's got someone they hate in this town?" And then you can either tell them the NPC, or give them some more ability to refine it like, "What did they do to you? What did you do to them?" Or let them get closer to choosing, such as "Was this person a bandit,* or a farmer?"<br/><br/>(A great possible relationship seems to be someone who knew Matthias from his days of banditry - especially since it looks like he is truly reformed)<br/><br/>Anyway, you've got a lot of meat there. You will probably make a few mistakes the first time. This is perfectly fine. You've got a better set up than my first time, where I failed to make any meaningful relationship connections to the PCs, so the whole story ended up rather lackluster.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/entropyblues" title="entropyblues"><img alt="entropyblues" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thejosefkstories.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/cropped-josefkbridge.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/entropyblues">entropyblues</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356084/#Comment_356084" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-26T13:26:47+00:00" title="January 26, 2012  1:26PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is brilliant stuff, gents, thank you all.<br/><br/>I've got two players, and the more I think about it, Lavinia doesn't <i>need</i> to be the PC's sister, I'll just make sure each of them has a solid relationship on each side of the divide, Lavinia or Amos or even Eli on one, and Matthias or Samuel on the other, and questioning the players sounds like the way to set this up so they feel some agency on the connections.

I mean, if the story calls for a mob, that's great. But you've got to feel really comfortable with the conflict rules: they can feel a little wonky in a "mob" situation (especially for Fallout and who takes the blow and all that kind of stuff).<br/><br/>With just two players, I would imagine that sticking with single NPCs for the players to interact with will make the game easy to play.<br/><br/>It's also difficult from the players' side: taking on a mob can be a difficult challenge! They get a lot of dice.<br/><br/>So, for simplicity's sake, I would stick to individual NPCs for a while. Pick interesting conflict stakes and push hard and things will getting interesting plenty quick.<br/><br/>If you need good conflict stakes, and "what does this NPC want?" isn't giving it to you right away, you can always ask the players something like:<br/><br/>"What do you really wish the Steward wouldn't do next?" or maybe "What are you most afraid of right now?"<br/><br/>Finally, if you feel lost or confused or unsure, just go into a conflict. You can just say, "OK, this NPC wants [you to validate their adultery]!" (insert what they want there) and then go to the dice. The game will get plenty interesting on its own, based on the mechanics!<br/><br/>You can have a great Dogs session just going straight from conflict to conflict to conflict, with almost no "free roleplaying," and that could be a good tool if you feel unsure about what to do next.<br/><br/>Let is know how it goes!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/entropyblues" title="entropyblues"><img alt="entropyblues" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thejosefkstories.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/cropped-josefkbridge.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/entropyblues">entropyblues</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356558/#Comment_356558" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-29T10:45:42+00:00" title="January 29, 2012 10:45AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2012 3:53PM by entropyblues.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, we had our game yesterday, and unfortunately due to the pressures of two of us having babies in the next room, we didn't get a chance to play for more than two hours.<br/><br/>The characters they created were:<br/><br/><b>Ben Coldstone</b>, a Mountain Person orphan and convert, whose Dog's coat was given to him by the trainer, the man that rescued him when his family was killed. The coat belonged to the trainer's son, and still bore the fatal bullet hole. When asked for a relationship with either Matthias or Samuel, he picked Matthias and decided that Matthias had killed his brother when he was orphaned. This through me for a loop.<br/><br/><b>Joseph Stapleton</b>, a sickly coughing youth (and Lavinia's brother), whose village was decimated by a fever that left him week. His coat is stitched together plague blankets from his village's dead. Awesome.<br/><br/>We had a couple of good initiations, that they both failed nicely. One of my players had read the book, and the other was still on the fence, but when he first realized he could get more dice by raising his fists, and the implications of the ease of escalation, his face lit up. He got it.<br/><br/>They rode into Sweetwater, where smoke still lingered, and a crowd of orchard hands had gathered outside Eli's house. They broke up the mob, and Matthias came up and demanded that they hear the orchard hands side first. <b>Conflict</b>! This worked out so so well. Ben Coldstone immediately recognized Matthias, and rolled his powerful 2d8 relationship dice, and narrated in his 2d4 Quick to anger. But Joseph had taken Matthias side in the conflict wanting to hear him out. So right away, player vs. player. Matthias had a trait for "seeking forgiveness" so he stopped Ben cold with a crazy high raise, where he recognized him and begged forgiveness, and asked to be treated like any Faithful. With Joseph on Matthias side for the stakes of "You will hear Matthias' side of the story" Ben had to give, holding over some dice for his next face-off with Matthias. They listened to Matthias, then to Eli, then rode on to meet Lavinia and Timothy, where they learned of the beating.<br/><br/>I still had a hard time forcing conflicts. Actually, I knew exactly when to start them, but had a devil of a time setting stakes. When they went to the Orchard, Samuel started a conflict when the Dogs were talking ill of Alice (Stakes: "You will address Sister Green with all due respect.") Joseph was most interested in getting Amos to come home and attend to his familial duties. So when Joseph suggested he be given the right to pursue Alice as a second wife, we launched into a real natural conflict. After some fiery scripture quoting, Amos lost his temper at some of the presumptuous things the Dogs (and a mountain person to boot) were telling him and he pushed Ben over. Ben chose to give, without escalating, but Joseph escalated all the way... <i>and shot his brother in law in the foot</i>, with all the orchard hands surrounding them. Matthias approached, helped Ben up from the ground and asked permission to take Amos to see a doctor.<br/><br/>At that point, the babies demanded our attention, so we broke for the afternoon. But boy howdy, do I have two new converts to "weird little games". After the game, they looked at my bookshelf, asking what this "Fiasco" and "Dungeon World" were, and could we try them next?<br/><br/>I'm really pleasantly surprised to see what happens when you plan nothing. It felt so damn natural, to let them drive the action. I think all three of us were shocked when sickly Joseph shot his brother in law in the foot, and the Dogs seem to be really siding with Lavinia and Eli, naturally assuming Alice is a sorcerer. But they haven't met Alice yet....<br/><br/>So, it was a success, albeit brief. Thanks to everyone, and thanks to Jason for his Wisdom from the Book of Life, which I printed out. We had a few conflicts that consisted of scripture-counterscripture that added a lot of flavor to the whole affair. Can't wait to finish the town!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356595/#Comment_356595" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-29T14:00:09+00:00" title="January 29, 2012  2:00PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds awesome!<br/><br/>Here's a piece of advice for going in to your next game: Don't let the players be fooled for long. Your GM instincts may tell you to preserve the "trick" that Alice is the Sorcerer, but don't! Actively reveal the town in play. Make it clear as quick as you can (by playing your NPCs) that Alice isn't who they thought she was. It sounds like that's your plan, but it can be a powerful temptation to let the players be fooled.<br/><br/>It can be hard to set stakes, and sometimes there's a nasty pause while you try to think of the right thing. Follow the book's advice: push for small stakes. Also, think about what the characters are doing, what they want, and who's involved. Remember stakes aren't "this happens/ or this happens" they're "this thing". That leaves you more scope to figure out the details as the conflict develops.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356606/#Comment_356606" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-29T15:01:08+00:00" title="January 29, 2012  3:01PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good job, man!

I told him: "Yes, this man is totally reformed and he is really is sorry for what he did to you". No need for Diplomacy checks, no need for Read Person, <i>you just know if it matters</i>. It was liberating, in a really awesome way. You just <i>tell</i> them.<br/><br/>After that it was easy. I let Lavinia and Eli cast aspersions of Sorcery (because they believe it, I let Samuel and Matthias deny it, but when they meet Alice who's not a sorcerer at all, I'm totally planning on telling them: "Nope, this is just a charismatic, willful woman. What do you do <i>now?</i>"<br/><br/>One of my players afterwards told me: "You know what makes me uneasy? No skill checks. I gave myself a 2d6 trait in Herbalism, but I won't get to use that unless it's part of a larger conflict? What if I just need to check the contents of a vial of poison?"<br/><br/>"You just know. You know herbs, you don't need to roll.
