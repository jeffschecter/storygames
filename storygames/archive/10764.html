An Owl Bear currently charging at you will require 4 hits from your bow before becoming discouraged enough to leave you in peace. Given your mental state, your probability of hitting the Owl Bear is roughly 0.4.<br/>You are obviously interested in the probability that you will be able to get the Owl Bear to leave you uncrushed. You have time to get 9 arrows off before the Owl Bear grabs you.<br/>(a) Without calculations, give an expected probability of discouraging the Owl Bear before being crushed as either \u201clow\u201d, \u201croughly 50/50\u201d, or \u201chigh\u201d. In your reasoning, reference the values in the problem.<br/>(b) Compute the exact probability that you will be able to discourage the Owl Bear before it grabs you.

Each time a 1 comes up is a hit. You need four or more hits. Roll nine of these dice at once. AnyDice says chance of &gt;= 4 hits is ~52%.<br/><br/>b) It's slightly easier to figure out the chance of failure, then take the complement. To fail, your nine shots need to generate either zero, one, two or three hits. To figure out the chance of <i>exactly</i> a certain number of hits <i>r</i> from n trials with success rate of p, the <br/> <a href="http://www.regentsprep.org/Regents/math/algtrig/ATS7/BLesson2.htm" rel="nofollow">raw formula</a> is C(<i>n</i>,<i>r</i>) * <i>p</i><sup><i>r</i></sup> * (1-<i>p</i>)<sup><i>n</i>-<i>r</i></sup>.<br/><br/>In this example, it is always the case that <i>n</i>=9 and <i>p</i>=0.4<br/><br/>Chance of exactly zero hits (<i>r</i>=0) = 0.01<br/>Chance of exactly zero hits (<i>r</i>=1) = 0.06<br/>Chance of exactly zero hits (<i>r</i>=2) = 0.16<br/>Chance of exactly zero hits (<i>r</i>=3) = 0.25<br/>Total chance of failure (summing the above) = 0.48<br/>Total chance of success (1 - chance of failure) = 1 - 0.48 = 0.52<br/><br/>c) Since gamers will never answer b (and probably not a, either), they will ask an infinite amount of questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_238752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/238752/#Comment_238752" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-22T11:15:18+00:00" title="October 22, 2009 11:15AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Steve,<br/>\na) I would say Low, It would take an average of 10 attacks and I don't have 10 attacks according to the information provided.<br/>\nb) Operating on the principle that you would make 0.4 hits per attack.

Probably more autistic gamers than the general averages across the population. Asperger's Syndrome is a high functioning form of Autism (with a number of symptoms that could be the basis for the typical "Nerd" stereotype), such individuals often have a fascination for numbers, patterns, systems and rule structures (while often lacking in areas such as social skills or emotional development). Roleplaying offers these individuals a way to focus on their patterns and rule structures while engaging in social play at a limited and more predictable format. I'd almost be inclined to posit that around half of all "rules lawyer" types are autistic at some degree on the spectrum (especially those who are busy searching for all those little +1 bonuses in the obscure pages of their hefty gaming books, while the rest of the table gets fed up with them). <br/><br/>I know that I have Asperger's, and I know a number of Asperger's support groups that use roleplaying as a means of socialising some of the more "socially inhibited" members, gently coaxing them out of their shells through structured encounters. Some of these groups also make regular forays to Sci-Fi and Comic conventions, but that's more to do with a common interest in the group and plays back into my beliefs that Asperger's is probably behind the "Nerd" stereotype.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
