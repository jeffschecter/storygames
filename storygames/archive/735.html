                    Okay, I'm totally grokking out with the push-pull stuff that Mo worked out in dialogue with Chris.  I have had fun talking to Tony and clarifying some of it for myself.  But I really want to se what the distinction can do once we take it for granted and just run with it.  I want to think about what it means for running and playing in a game, what it means for designing a game, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
So, I am opening a thread just for that.  I don't want it to get cluttered with what a push and a pull are, I just want to start using them.  I'm not entirely sure where that could or should go, so I would be happy to see a flurry of ideas, perhaps even using this thread as a nest thread from which other threads using push-pull could jump off.  If you jump on something that is getting tons of responses, maybe pull it out and start a thread just for it?<br/>
<br/>
When I get some chunks of time, I want to start posting some of my own ideas, but I thought I would start by soliciting others.                </div>

Actual play is never a bad thing.  <br/><br/>I feel like I'm using pull all the time in a weekly TSOY game, although lately I stepped down as GM and find my key-hammering powerz to be somewhat reduced as a mere player.  It's an interesting challenge to create itneractions with other players can react to in fun ways (that generate scintillating cascades of XP).  I wish the GM had keys, too.                        </div>

<i>Are you looking for actual play, or techniques for incorporating, or both, or what? Actual play is never a bad thing. </i><br/><br/>Both!  On the one hand, I'm curious about how the distinction can function in play but also how it can be built in to the system at the design stage.<br/><br/>On thing I'm wondering: I have been running a 3.5 D&amp;D game which, to my mind, is designed to be fairly push-centered.  The mechanics don't really give you a whole lot to encourage players to pull--I think part of that may rest on its emphasis on in-game mechanics rather than 'metagame' negotiation where a lot of pulling gets done.<br/><br/>Now, I have four players (P, R, T, K--they will know who they are if they ever drift on in)--one of them is a woman (K), the rest are men.  K is new to tabletop gaming, R is an rpg veteran, the rest of us somewhere in between (but all more than 5 years of gaming experience).<br/><br/>In a disappointing session (one of the watershed sessions that really got me thinking about alternative games and led me to start digging around places like this), you have the following dynamic:<br/><br/>Party kicks in door and begins to mow down baddies (in this case, a Cleric, her devil guards, and two monks).  The cleric and devils go down hard, the monks do not, but it is clear that they do not pose a real danger to the party.  This is all very push, push, push.<br/><br/>P &amp; T get into the smackdown, starting to taunt monks with their immanent demise.  R begins to voice some concern about why the smackdown is happening--they sort of burst in there and went at it without trying to talk to them.  At this point, we are reaching a pull--he's trying to solicit a similar response from the other players (very much, 'hey we're the good guys, what are we doing?').  K picks up on this and hesitates.  Other players keep up with the combat, leading R to push, namely withdraw his character from the combat, trying to 'force' the matter.<br/><br/>I pick up on the fact that both K &amp; R have become distressed with the current direction of the session and throw in some description to really humanize the monks, to 'pull' the other players into thinking of an alternative route.<br/><br/>P &amp; T are a mixture of frustrated and confused by the change--they just want to get on with the smackdown and wind up.  They keep up with the smackdown (essentially pushing back on R), and K joins the fray reluctantly so as not to drag things out.  I let them ignore my pull and finish the smackdown.<br/><br/>There is some interesting post-game stuff that surrounds this, but I'll stick with the session.<br/><br/>Things that jump out at me: <br/><br/>1. there is a way in which a lot of good players (and GM's) begin to 'telegraph' dissatisfaction by first pulling.  If that pull is ignored, they often follow it up with a push.  I think they do this because they have good social skills, even if the game doesn't have the best mechanics for facilitating them.<br/><br/>2. the confusion seems to happen, in part, because players and GM's don't do a good job of switching up to a metagame discussion.  We stick to the mechanics which discourage tabletalk, discourage metagaming. Because of that, (back to example) R doesn't have a platform to really establish his pull and so he gets shouted down (no real shouting, just metaphorical).  That leads to a little resentment and a push back--a push that the game allows but which it can't easily 'recapture' for game fiction purposes--sort of overflows into the player level with potential hurt feelings.<br/><br/>It really seems like the game would have gone much better if there had been a mechanic in place that would allow a player to explicitly flag their pull.  The combat rounds made it easy for him to flag a push (my character steps away, my character voices frustration, etc.) but not so easy for him to flag his pull ('hey, let's do something besides beat these guys down--what if we could talk them down, appeal to their ideals, something...').  Something real simply could have worked--'hey guys, I just want to flag something: we strolled in here without a lot of forethought, maybe we should..."<br/><br/>It seems like a lot of really bad gaming disasters (this definitely wasn't one of those) occurs when someone's pulls get overlooked again and again, so that they feel 'driven' to a push or outright withdraw.  Now, it would be great if the GM could flag their pulls, too--it might help break the habits of players who think of every GM action as push (more or less covert).<br/><br/>an irony: it seems that a lot of good pull players flee these push games--not pushing back, but withdrawing (in big or little ways).  They want more cooperation, more give and take, and so when that is frustrated they vacate.                        </div>

                            Don't know if you've seen it, but I (unknowingly) <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=15040.0" rel="nofollow">proposed a pull-centered game</a> a while ago.  Basically, in order to succeed in an action against a character, the character's owner must buy into it (and is rewarded for doing so).<br/><br/>Armed with Brand's latest post, I now see that I put the pull mechanics squarely at the effect state. That's a really cool insight, for me, because it enables me to think about pull at the other three stages (intent, initiation, execution).<br/><br/>And I think you have a good example of actual play there, including the fact that most pulling happens at the intent stage ("Why don't we do this or that"); and the fact that that's discouraged is based on the social contract. Because I'm not sure it says anywhere in the rules for the game that you can't do this.                        </div>

                            How am I using Push/Pull?<br/><br/>I'm watching my patterns of Push and Pull within story arcs and sessions, and wondering how I can change them up to achieve different narrative effects.  I'm a very narratively free-form GM; I tend to start every story arc with Pulls all over the place, and then use the players' organic choices to work up to a nice big Push climax scene.  (Yes, I know, that sounds dirty.  I think I'm just going to have to live with it.)  Now I'm wondering whether that escalation from Pull to Push is necessary, or if I can use Pull later in the story to achieve climax (oh dear) that's just as effective as the Push kind.  I'm also planning to start my next story arc with a big Push bang to see how that makes things different.  Go go <i>in medias res</i>!!<br/><br/>Also, I'm using it to be very conscious about how and whether I abandon storylines, as I mentioned in another thread.<br/><br/>Really, I'm always striving to be a better GM and game designer, and this has been one more useful tool to make that happen!<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

Your description of pulls leading up to a push sorta sounds like using enough pull input that you eventually earn the right to make a push. Even if that's not quite accurate, it's kind of a neat thought.                        </div>

                            Hmm, no, not quite accurate - it's more that they care a lot more about the push if they've previously followed up on related pulls - but yeah, definitely a neat thought.

<i>I'm watching my patterns of Push and Pull within story arcs and sessions, and wondering how I can change them up to achieve different narrative effects. </i><br/><br/>Jess, this reminds of something I started thinking about in my discussion with Tony--namely, if you consider push - pull to be fairly basic elements of social interactions, its grammatical units so to speak, then what do you end up with when you start thinking about 'sentences' of these things?<br/><br/>I called D&amp;D a push-y system and might try to compare it with pull-y systems, but that seems a fairly rudimentary comparison.  It seems like you could do something a little broader, talk about the number of pushes v. pulls encouraged by a system, by a GM, by a player, and then consider the way in which those tend to occur (does this pull lead to a push, or another pull, what about...).  I bet there are some very push games that have some serious pulls wired into local components, things that help keep the game feeling really 'cooperative' just as I bet a really good pull-y game might employ pushes to keep a certain kind of momentum.<br/><br/><i>Yes, I know, that sounds dirty. I think I'm just going to have to live with it.</i><br/><br/>Not being silly: the comparison is probably sound, though, even if the reduction should happen the opposite way in a purely logical sense (i.e. sex is a social exchange of a very physical sort and entails the same sort of dynamics--the medium, of course, of bodies is a good deal different than that of story, but still the dynamic is there).                        </div>

                            In the game of Truth and Justice that Mo and I were playing the other night, there came a moment where Mo's character was facing off with Matador, an evil but sexy bastard who has been her lover and enemy for ages. They've always played this cat and mouse game and ended up just barely getting away from the other at the right moment. You all know the drill, I'm sure. <br/><br/>So, this time things are different. This time they are fighting to really hurt each other, to end everything once and for all and crush the other in spirit as well as body. It's a seriously ugly fight, and Mo and I are slamming at each other back and forth, doing our level best to destroy each other's character. <br/><br/>Then I narrate this one action where Matador gets the upper hand and just molly-whomps all over Mo's character. The way we describe the layout of it on the page (we pose everything like pannels in a graphic novel) is that it looks like a domestic assault, with all of his nobility stripped from him as he just beats her up and down in the most vulgar, ugly way. <br/><br/>Mo then picks up her dice to roll, to stop the above brutal beating of course, and then stops in the middle of figuring out what she's going to use and says, "What if I want that to happen? Like everything you said happens, but then at the end when her face is all bloody and she's spitting out crap she's still standing and then he has to face what he's done." <br/><br/>And then I'm like, "Well, what if he knocks you on your ass and stomps on you, and then has to stop because he's out of breath and you're sitting there panting and looking up and him and the both of you have to stop and look at yourselves and what you've both become." <br/><br/>And then Mo goes, "Huh, but what the hell would I roll to do that?" And we both look down and realize that Truth and Justice resolution doesn't work that way. Neither of us really has the authority to do what we just described, and it's pretty clearly something important. So instead of rolling we shrug and say, "Okay, what we just said -- ink it." <br/><br/>So Mo narrates getting monkey stomped, and then I narrated him looking into her eyes, and then they got really nasty as they stopped fighting and escalated to talking. Then we go back to rolling and using the system normal style. <br/><br/>So there's the thing about it, we switched from a fortune (mostly at the end) system to a drama in the middle system right there in mid stream when we hit a place where the mechanics in the book wouldn't let us do what we wanted to. Later, I realized we do this all the time, though often we bandy about Hero Points as currency in the exchange.<br/><br/>So, when you're desining a game, I think it might be an interesting thing to consider where and when you see your system working and how it gets subverted when people want to agree on something rather than when they want to contest something. Rolling for what your character wants is one way to go, but is it always the best? What about when you want to lose, but lose in a specific way? What about when everyone agrees what should happen before you get to the dice? Does that short-circut what you're doing with your resolution, or can it handle that?                        </div>

Even though you're a bastard for not coming to GenCon, I'm going to respond to your comment.<br/>
<br/>
That thing Mo wanted to do, it's not really losing. There's something she wants for her character, so you roll to see if she gets it. You could do it with TSOY, for example. It'd probably be a parallel conflict, where first Mo's character is directly opposing with the fighting and stuff, but then Mo's like, "I'm switching to some kind of moral high ground conflict where my goal is to psychologically fuck your character up." It'd use a completely different pool, I'd think, so it'd actually be a reasonably good tactic in that game.                        </div>

                            Matt, <br/><br/>I agree. That's also a nifty way that TSOY lets you do that kind of thing. Even if it is still tied to your character doing something rather than your player saying something. It's a good way to handle it. <br/><br/>Other ways that spring instantly to mind are things like the Idea roll in the Pool, or the way that Elfs lets you roll for actor/author/director stance in different ways ("If I do this I dodge, if I do that I get beat but manage to humiliate him as he beats me/etc."), or the way that PTA would have done it all as one conflict and we could have narrated any damn thing we wanted about who won or lost. <br/><br/>Heck, Truth and Justice actually does have a way of kind of dealing with it. The problem we had with the system at that moment was that Matador was on the button (he was attacking) and Mo was basically saying, "I don't defend, but let him beat me to get the up on the next thing." With the rules as they stand in that game, by doing that without us sidestepping the normal process, Mo's character would have been killed (or at least knocked out of the fight) because Matador's attack would have done MASSIVE damage. And Mo didn't have a character ability that would let her get hit and get beat but still keep fighting. (She's a spidermanish character, great dodge but no toughness.) <br/><br/>We possibly could have jurry-rigged something to make it work with the normal system, but it felt like more effort than just stepping around it. And that's the point at which you're going to lose people with your design -- if they can get what they want more efficiently/intuitivly/easily by not following the rules than by following them, then chances are they're going to not follow them. <br/><br/>It sort of goes back to something I said somewhere in all the babbling I do online, "It's less important what you can actually do with the system than what you feel/know that you can do with the system." So how is it that we design clearly to clear goals of where we want people building meaning? Do we want it to be focused through character action, or do we want it to happen in other ways?                        </div>

                            Matt,<br/><br/>Brand's example is similar to one of my own, but mine may be more extreme.  Recently, in our weekly <i>HeroQuest</i> game, I managed to get a character killed.  It went down something like this.<br/><br/>My character and another PC, who have this high-tension relationship (there has already been a near-fatal stabbing at this point in the story) are involved in yet another high-tension discussion.  I'd been looking for a way to bow this character out of play as I'd dealt with most of what I wanted to deal with with him, and it struck me that a fatal stabbing would be perfect.<br/><br/>But in <i>HeroQuest</i>, all your abilities are tied to the character, and my character had no intention of being stabbed to death.  So I turned to my fellow player and said, "Hey, could you stab Sebastian to death?"  There wasn't really anything to roll.  I was trying to attain a pure personal as-a-player goal.  But it was also narratively important.  Sebastian has been a pretty big player in the game for a while, and killing him was sort of momentous.<br/><br/>So, there is something I want for my character, but the way the mechanics of the game are set up, there's no real way to utilize the mechanics to adjudicate it...<br/><br/>EDIT: x-posted with Brand above.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            I don't get it. If you don't need or want to use the resolution system as it stands to get the result you want, why on earth would you? You want to invoke mechanical resolution when one of 2 things is true:<br/>
<br/>
1. The players with an interest in the outcome disagree over what the outcome should be<br/>
2. The characters with an interest in the outcome have a conflict of interest<br/>
<br/>
#1 always overrides #2<br/>

Otherwise, just roll on with your unstructured drama, dude.                        </div>

                            True, Matt.  I think the complication in Brand's example was the conflict -- in which you roll dice -- wasn't over yet and the system had no way to handle that sort of thing during conflict.<br/>

                            Mark, <br/><br/>You're always using system, even in the "unstructured drama" -- so how do you want to design to that? Your answer seems to be, correct me most quickly if I'm wrong, that you don't. You design for when people don't just want to do that, and leave it there. And that's cool, if that's what you're doing. (In fact its what most game do, I think.) <br/><br/>But see, I'm interested in things like Polaris, but taken a step farther, combined with, say, Christian and Jonathan's ideas about story-arc-chains and how you could use that to structure the unstructured drama.                        </div>

                            First off--great example.  Mo pulls, you accept.  Narrative really steps up.<br/><br/>A few here and there observations: <br/><br/>1. The switch-up happens with that 'metagame'  window opening.  A momentary step outside of the 'frame' and the mechanics as operating.  Which makes me think that a really good pull-driven game needs to foster a certain sort of metagame mentality.  I think this is one thing (of many) Crime &amp; Punishment does well--the frame of players as writers creates a space that is strangely 'in-game out-of-character.'<br/><br/>The way you and Mo use the 'ink it' and layout models seems similar in this regard. <br/><br/><i>the players will - and SHOULD - always have a layer of 'free play' operating outside of that structure.</i><br/><br/>2. I think yes, too, but what I want to take away from this: the freeform moments help us get to what we think is really cool in a storied fashion, and encourage us to break out of system molds holding us back.  However, once we find a place where that system mold is holding us back, why not start thinking about ways the system might not hold us back, might in fact help us get there to begin with?<br/><br/>I tend to think of most activities as being a kernel of habit surrounded by an experimental bubble of variation, the variation providing the 'cushion' necessary for adaptation.  When the habit fails, the experimental (and this isn't 'raw' randomness, but 'partially' habituated) kicks in.  If the experimental really works, then it should (in most cases) make its way into the habitual kernel.  We have freeform so we can grow, but we also want to bring that freeform back to the habit.<br/><br/>In gaming, the central feature of that kernel is the mechanics that the system provides us.  We take that system, use it, creating the 'experimental' freeform bubble on our own.  We can find what was cool about that freeform bubble and bring it back to the kernel.  To some extent, sure, the coolest thing about the bubble is its experimental capacity, not the particular results, but bringing back particular results to the kernel means that you get an opportunity to enrich someone else's bubble when they pick up your addition to the kernel.<br/><br/>Which is a long-ish way of saying that I'm not sure any designer can entirely show where their elements are and aren't useful, because you find that out by applying them, and there can be surprises along the way.  It isn't that you 'want' to use a resolution that doesn't work but, in fact, contribute to the resolution system so that it does work--for other people in a similar situation.                        </div>

<p>Mark, that's an interesting take.  I don't think that I buy it as stated, but there are questions in there I would really like to explore:  particularly, I am very interested in the question of what people get from play that is only implicitly structured (by social rules and reward structures) that they cannot get from play that is implicitly and explicitly structured (by mechanics that say "This is what you can do now," and such stuff).</p>
<p>I expect that my phrasing above points to the major disagreement that I have with you on terminology ... I don't think that the distinction between structured and unstructured play is very clear.  To parrot the Lumpley Principle, all play is structured by rules, it's just that some of these rules are written down and clearly communicated and some of them aren't.</p>
<p>I still think there's an important distinction between implicit and explicit play, but it's not the same as the distinction between structured and unstructured play.  All play is structured.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>

                            Ian, <br/><br/>We stole "storyboard, pencil, ink" from With Great Power. Funny, isn't it, how we so often yank things from one game to another? The folks I know who play Blue Rose, for example, totally run it like Dogs now -- with the PCs coming into town to clean up sins. It's funny to watch. <br/><br/>I also agree that you can't, as a designer, predict everything folks will or will not be able to do with your system. No matter how much you test there will always be that X factor to make things go loopy. The key, however, is having a strong enough core structure that it can support and ride around those things. Something like Dogs does this pretty well -- I've had situations come up in Dogs that I wasn't sure how to handle first thing off, but I've never had something come up that I couldn't handle with the mechanics at all. <br/><br/>Also, the rest of your description, about flexibility and principled vs. ad-hoc decisions, reminds me of this article by Vincent: <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=23" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=23</a> -- with your argument being that no matter how thin the slice, there must be a place for the ad hoc decisions that will grow and mutate the rules over time. I'm I hearing you right?                        </div>

<i>with your argument being that no matter how thin the slice, there must be a place for the ad hoc decisions that will grow and mutate the rules over time. I'm I hearing you right?</i><br/><br/>Thanks for the link--that's a nice article.  And, yes, that is what I am saying.<br/><br/><i>The key, however, is having a strong enough core structure that it can support and ride around those things.</i><br/><br/>Yes, I agree here, too.  I think the two are related--a good 'core structure' provides the basic tools necessary to facilitate the exchange between rules (as printed in the game) and modifications (the modifications to rules that emerge in play--which Vincent defines as part of the rules from the get go.  No real debate with Vincent on that, just different terms).  <br/><br/>I like the way in which Vincent considers the way in which we actually play as much a part of the rules as the printed material--I just want to highlight how getting the unprinted back into print seems part of the exchange that places like this are designed to foster.  And that the exchange makes it easier to get systems with a strong enough core to adapt to all manner of not-printed modifications.<br/><br/>I think 'in-game out-of-character' frames are good for facilitating this, for one.  They can't do it all, but they seem a place to start.  They establish a more pull-friendly zone by demarcating where there are player-player interactions involved and not just character-character ones.  Player to player interactions seem one of the best routes to rules changes being assimilated--they make the habits being developed more explicit and actually involve folks 'getting together' and 'getting behind' them.<br/><br/>GM driven change works just fine, but I suspect that the changes that occur here are more likely to fly under the radar--things players just accept tacitly without really 'adopting' them explicitly.  This has been my experience slowly hacking away from a D20 rules set with my group--it's made me better at flagging changes for them, though.  The process is more likely to be trial and error (where they apply expectations gained from standard rules to the game being played with modified ones and learn where they cease to function) and a touch bumpier interpersonally ("Hey, that's not in the rules").<br/><br/>(I'm thinking folks like Vincent with more Forge terms under their belt might insert some stuff about how this relates to breaking [naive] expectations about character ownership--but I may be wrong).                        </div>

<p>Ian ... cool!  I'm not sure I quite get what you mean by 'in-game out-of-character' frames, but I totally get the idea of a core structure providing a foundation for players to create their own game (often unconsciously) as they play.</p>
<p>I ... have no suggestions on how to make such a core structure.  I will just watch avidly until something clicks with me.</p>

                            Ian, <br/><br/>Cool, I'm glad to hear you say that about the framing in C+P. The intent of it was to play somewhere between story support and Meg's "safe space" where the players would be fully invested in each other, and have that framework to ensure the story they are telling is a common endeavor that they know will be fulfilled so they could push the heck out of each other by bidding, and feel entirely safe doing it.<br/><br/>I like that 'in-game out-of-character.' space. I often find that if it clicks, everything else will fall into line.                        </div>

I haven't heard 'safe space' used as an rpg term before--your explanation seems pretty clear and intuitive, but is there a place I could look to see the sorts of discussions that go on around that term (perhaps where Meg formulated it)?                        </div>

                            Thanks Brand--good stuff there.  One thing I have noticed about full-blown ritual spaces is that you need a person whose job it is to administrate the space, to ferry people in and out of it if they bring up something they can't handle.<br/>
<br/>
Mo--I like the hybrid frame you describe--sort of a built in overflow for a good game.  If the in-character issues get too intense, they have a 'writerly' persona to withdraw toward and through which they can manage redirects.<br/>
<br/>
Mo's idea that you provide a place where you can be safe so that you can push all the harder later strikes me as really interesting--partly because it seems to hook up with my idea that we could talk about a game's 'push-pull' grammar.  C&amp;P has a pull-driven session that fosters pushing later...I don't know what to make of that exactly at the moment, but I'll flag it as interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing it makes me think about: how much does pulling have to do with establishing trust?  It strikes me that one of the things going on in the pull heavy portion of C&amp;P is that players develop a trust rooted in their cooperative investment of the story--sort of like a contract.  The very building of the contract establishes some of the habits that make safe play more likely.<br/>
<br/>
It also seems like getting a chance to 'feel out' how your fellow players pull gives you a good idea of the sort of things they like and are good at working with, an indication of where you can push later.  This is an amorphous idea--learning to observe and appreciate how someone pulls as also facilitating your pushing with them later.  Sound sensible?                        </div>

Kind of funny how rich these sorts of metaphors are...<br/><br/>It's almost like this: "ok, here we all are on the train going to Manhattan.  We know our destination, but the train itself is pretty cool.  There are fun people to talk to, a few different train cars to hang out in..."  Railroading on the Orient Express (If it went to Manhattan ; )<br/><br/><i>in both cases, the mechanical support provides an easy avenue to support lack of skill where it may (or may not) exist....Do you think it did this successfully?</i><br/><br/>Yes, it looks like it does.  I can't see any reason why it shouldn't do exacty what you describe.  I want to take it for a test drive and see the complications-elaborations of it in play.  Maybe I can wrangle my group into playing around with it.  They tend to get a little scared when I talk about rpg's outside of the fantasy genre, but maybe I can sweet talk'em. <br/><br/>Hmmm, where is my bag of treats?  We have really been talking a lot about more cooperation, maybe they would dig it as an experiment toward that end...<br/>(ok, fair enough--gametesting C&amp;P already has a thread of its own, I'll go over there if I get them behind the idea)                        </div>
