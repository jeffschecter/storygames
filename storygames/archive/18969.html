It's an OD&amp;D variant geared towards human centered, Cnan/Fafyrd+ Grey Mouser type game. Classes are Fighter/Barbarian/Thief/M-U, with a fair bit of survivability thrown in matching a bit better with SnS type settings. M-Us are a bit downplayed ( magic tends to be more costly the more offensive oriented it is, and clerics and MUs are blended into one class).<br/><br/>The setting is a bit metal-riffic for my tastes, so I'll likely tone it down a bit. But only a little bit. Also, a bit Thooloo-ish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423764">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423764/#Comment_423764" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-05T09:19:25+00:00" title="November  5, 2013  9:19AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 5, 2013 9:23AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I miss my <a href="http://www.goodman-games.com/dccrpg.html" rel="nofollow">Dungeon Crawl Classics</a> game and would run it again if I could get a team of people together that were way into it (the last one failed because most of the players weren't really on board with the rules).<br/><br/>I've also been looking at <a href="http://vaultsofnagoh.blogspot.com/2011/07/small-but-vicious-dog-steals-hearts.html" rel="nofollow">Small but Vicious Dog</a>, which is a mutant hybrid of WFRP and D&amp;D B/X.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith" title="E.T.Smith"><img alt="E.T.Smith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1090/buddyicons/8542318@N07.jpg?1180909196"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/E.T.Smith">E.T.Smith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423770/#Comment_423770" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-05T09:55:16+00:00" title="November  5, 2013  9:55AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Over the last year I've been drawn to <i>Swords &amp; Wizardry</i>, discovering that I really enjoy the implicit call to tinker and customize the game to my own liking, that it amazingly manages to be light and open-ended while still being filled with enough cool toys and pre-packaged ideas to avoid blank-canvas paralysis, and that its both easy and robust enough to serve a satisfying pick-up-and-play experience. I used it to introduce five young folks to RPG's, and they grasped both the systems and the expectations behind those systems in minutes, and enthusiastically turned what was supposed to be a two-hour intro into a full evening's dungeon exploration.<br/><br/>The interesting thing is, back when it first came out, I gave <i>S&amp;W</i> a skim and a pass; I still had my original BXD&amp;D books, so it just seemed redundant. What changed is the commuity that grew up around the game, and the OSR in general, produced really good discussion in the following years that clearly explicated how Old-School play was supposed to work, and in turn that discussion led to excellent publications with a deliberate focus on actual-play results. "D&amp;D" ceased to mean bloated useless TSR campaign settings, but practical tools like random dungeon geomorphs, James Raggi's esoteric monster generator, <i>Stars Without Number</i>'s planet generator, and the voluminous one-page-dungeon compilations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423772/#Comment_423772" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-05T09:59:56+00:00" title="November  5, 2013  9:59AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm playing more old games than OSR games at the moment (I also miss Bret's DCC game, which was a ton of fun). <br/><br/>I'm currently in a gloriously sim weekly <a href="http://www.kelestia.com/" rel="nofollow">Harnmaster Gold</a> game. Dro has been posting about it on G+ if you're in his circles. There's some serious heft to the system (people who think BW is crunchy need not apply), but it's entertaining. Part of the fun is asking seemingly innocuous questions of Topi (the GM) that make him dive into the Harnic esoterica for an answer. Ex.: So today is [such and such a date], what's the weather like? What time does the sun set today? What's the cost of medium-quality silk from Melderyn at the market in Burzyn from the first caravan of the year?<br/><br/>In almost every case, there's an answer printed somewhere in a supplement or zine. The best is when Topi sighs and says that he knows the answer is in such and such a zine, issue such and such, but he doesn't have it. Then Dro says, "I might have it," and returns 10 seconds later with the exact thing.<br/><br/>Dro has also offered to run Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 1st edition, which played a similar role in Poland to what D&amp;D played here in the US. I'm embarrassingly excited about this one. I played about two sessions of this in the 80s, but then my friend who owned it moved away.<br/><br/>Dro posted a list of things he's excited about:<br/>- mutants <br/>- chaos <br/>- skaven <br/>- evil and backward villages <br/>- bad weather <br/>- mud <br/>- cold <br/>- necromancers <br/>- troll slayers <br/>- critical hit charts <br/>- chaos cults <br/>- protection from rain spell  <br/>- fate points <br/>- career leveling system <br/><br/>To which I have added:<br/>- mohawks<br/><br/><br/>As far as actual OSR stuff, there are a few things that I'm impatiently awaiting. One is Frog God Games' Lost Lands: Sword of Air Kickstarter. Sword of Air is a megadungeon/mega sandbox setting by Bill Webb, who brought us Rappan Athuk, The Crucible of Freya and Tomb of Abysthor under Necromancer Games in the D&amp;D 3.x days. Backers get to choose whether they want a Swords &amp; Wizardry version or a Pathfinder version. I'm obviously interested in the former. Already, as part of the Kickstarter, they have made the complete Swords &amp; Wizardry rules (complete with art) <a href="http://swordsandwizardry.blogspot.com/2013/11/swords-wizardry-complete-rules-now-free.html" rel="nofollow">available as a free PDF</a>. Swords &amp; Wizardry is an OD&amp;D retroclone.<br/><br/>I'm also excited to see what comes of <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/davebrown/adventures-in-the-east-mark-the-red-box" rel="nofollow">Adventures in the East Mark</a>, aka Aventuras en La Marca del Este. It's a translation of an old Spanish game that was essentially a BECMI retroclone, but with an added focus on mounted and aerial combat and seafaring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423773/#Comment_423773" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-05T10:09:50+00:00" title="November  5, 2013 10:09AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for sharing, folks.\n<blockquote><br/>I'm also excited to see what comes of <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/davebrown/adventures-in-the-east-mark-the-red-box" rel="nofollow">Adventures in the East Mark</a>, aka Aventuras en La Marca del Este.

For a little over $15 (the price point for the bonus added material) you get a lot of OSR stuff! 2 days left and ticking. A mix of games and modules. Including a booklet of advice compiled by someone who still runs White Box D&amp;D. A friend of mine highly recommended ACK, and I picked up the Bundle last night.<br/><br/><i>Old School Revival bundle, a large collection of tabletop roleplaying games, supplements, and modules inspired by the do-it-yourself spirit of the earliest days of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>The Old School Revival offers tools, not plotlines -- rulings, not rules -- a gamemaster who doesn't railroad players onto a prearranged script but lets them sink or swim through their own actions. Encounters aren't necessarily "balanced" and outcomes are seldom scripted. Characters who don't use their heads usually wind up losing them. Many OSR games use 'retro-clone' versions of one or another early edition of D&amp;D/AD&amp;D.<br/><br/>This OSR bundle focuses on supplements and modules for two leading OSR retro-clones, <b>Swords &amp; Wizardry</b> (Original D&amp;D) and <b>Labyrinth Lord</b> (Moldvay-Cook B/X D&amp;D). For a price you set yourself (minimum US$3.95) you can get our core collection of four DRM-free .PDFs -- including the S&amp;W 2012 rulebook and two supplements, along with S&amp;W designer Matt Finch's amazing module Tomb of the Iron God -- plus an "OSR Toolkit," unique to this bundle, with plenty of handy resources. The base bundle also includes the free, no-art PDF of <i><b>Lamentations of the Flame Princes - Player Core Book: Rules &amp; Magic</b></i>s.<br/><br/>Pay more than the current average to get nine bonus titles, including the complete game <b>Adventurer Conqueror King</b>; The God That Crawls and The Monolith From Beyond Space and Time by leading OSR designer James Raggi; Vornheim by Zak S.; Matt Finch's Demonspore and the first module in his Cyclopean Deeps campaign, Down to Ques Querax; and the acclaimed Stonehell Dungeon by Michael Curtis. Together these offer everything you need to start your own Old School fantasy campaign.</i><br/><br/>[Edited to add: I started reading THE GOD THAT CRAWLS last night, and adventure I picked up in the Bundle. I just wanted to say James Edward Raggi IV (<i>Lamentations of the Flaming Princess</i>) is one solid writer.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/geordie%20racer" title="geordie racer"><img alt="geordie racer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/geordie%20racer">geordie racer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423999/#Comment_423999" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-09T11:42:30+00:00" title="November  9, 2013 11:42AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm interested in <b><a href="http://freepdfhosting.com/4b9891123c.pdf" rel="nofollow">Tower of Adamant</a></b>, after seeing a thread about it on Rpgnet.

Then there are Vocations, which you can mix and match with a character (A Strong Character might be a soldier, a gladiator, whatever.) Each character is also customized further with Species and Affiliations.<br/><br/>More info on character creation <a href="http://scriptogr.am/sbr/post/whitehack-one" rel="nofollow">at a review here.</a><br/><br/><br/>People who have played were <a href="http://odd74.proboards.com/thread/9370/whitehack-great-new-rpg?page=1&amp;scrollTo=128934" rel="nofollow">chatting on a forum about the game</a>:\n<blockquote>here are some initial thoughts:<br/><br/>* This is a toolbox. Amost NOTHING is defined within the rules. FREX, you can make a Wise character; all this means mechanically is that they can perform "miracles". Miracles aren't defined other than as being some sort of special effect that costs HPs to use. So, a Wise character could be a Wizard, a Priest, a Psychic, a Scientist, a Superhero, a Mutant... etc. Concurrently, a miracle could then be a spell, a prayer, a mental power, the effect of a device or compound, an innate power, a mutation. This. Is. Cool.Even the HP cost is determined via negotiation between player and GM.<br/><br/>* It accomplishes a LOT with the simple advantage/disadvantage double-d20 roll that I, anyhow, became familiar with through the first playtest iteration of DNDNext. I love that mechanic, so it's nice to see it in play in a different set of rules<br/><br/>* There are many suggestionsin the text, and very few prescriptions. It puts me in mind of the text of T&amp;T, not to mention the S&amp;W Whitebox rules from whence came its inspiration.<br/><br/>* As previously mentioned, it has a robust conflict-resolution system (outside of combat), ranging from straight ability checks, to opposed contests, to a bidding system. I really like this, though it's somewhat problematic to use it with monsters. These systems all rely on ability scores, and the monsters, defined only on a table, have no ability scores. It's possible, of course, to just make them up on the fly, but it would've been nice to see that mentioned in the text.<br/><br/>* The introductory adventures, while both cool in their own way, well, I would rather have seen only one, with the remaing page space dedicated to a few more examples of WHITEHACK-unique things like Vocations and Affiliations.<br/></blockquote>\nSomeone  else who has played it summarized the magic system like this:\n<blockquote>First off, the miracles mechanic is amazing. It's a superbly simple and incredibly powerful way of describing spells, magic abilities, mutations, special feats and higher tech as limiting or free as your gaming group sees fit. A specific miracle can take a few attempts to 'settle' - that is, you might go through two-three usage scenarios before the DM and player have reached a consensus and gut feeling about the power level and flexibility of it. I recommend that you take this time in character generation. When a player describes the miracles she wishes to use, just ask "can you tell me two or three circumstances in which you would use this and what effect it would have?" Then give your idea of how many hit points this would cost and if you'd like to limit, expand or balance it somehow. That's five minutes well spent. Don't feel like doing that? Just pick a spell from any other game, assign a hit point cost to it and go.<br/></blockquote>\nAnd <a href="http://www.stargazersworld.com/2013/10/02/whitehack/" rel="nofollow">a longer review here</a>.<br/><br/>It's only available in print, and only from Lulu. $10 for a 32 page booklet.

Which is what D&amp;D was supposed to offer up. (Most people kept the faux-Tolkien and Vance magic even as the rules bloated over time. A mystery as to why!)<br/><br/>The charm of a game like Lamentation of the Flame Princess or Whitehack is that there aren't long skill lists and such. The rule cover matters of blunt survival (punching, stabbing, poison, fireballs) but everything else -- all other problem solving options concocted by the players are resolved through fictional positioning and rulings for the odds of success made up on the spot for that situation. (This is either charming to people... Or not.)<br/><br/>In other words, as I phrased it elsewhere, the problems of the world engage the rules obliquely. The gears to engage are not always clear, or have to be invented on the spot. In some games the Players aren't pushed to come up with clever fictional positioning or ideas because the game system's gears can almost bypass the players -- if not the fiction! <br/><br/>How does 13th Age stack up on that front? How detailed are the rules? How big are the rules?<br/><br/>Significantly, how complicated is the Character Sheet? If you've seen the cover of a Whitehack, that's the character sheet. I like that character sheet. It's sparse and clear and it means a lot of the fun is going to come from all the players coming up with stuff that *isn't* on that character sheet.<br/><br/>I'll look up reviews now!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424224/#Comment_424224" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-14T21:50:06+00:00" title="November 14, 2013  9:50PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can anyone explain the Whitehack auction rules?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424225/#Comment_424225" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-14T22:12:16+00:00" title="November 14, 2013 10:12PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Players can bid to go first in a round by bidding the value they will get greater than on their d20 roll. The higher the bid, the earlier you go. But you still have to roll your target number or less to succeed at your roll, but now you also have to get above your bid.<br/><br/>An example from the author on a <a href="https://plus.google.com/110971724630690941607/posts/ZDihTiNMfAP" rel="nofollow">G+ thread</a> <br/><br/>Let us say that the characters are trying to board a ship and rescue a prisoner before the ship leaves shore. The villain captain deploys some of his people to stop the characters on the shore, while the other crew members make ready for departure. I\u2019d run the fight on the shore as an auction, but I\u2019d run the consecutive fight with the captain and his best fighters using the regular combat rules.<br/><br/>For the auction, I\u2019d make one group of enemies for each player character, and decide on an approximate attribute for each group, using 10 as a base value (see p. 19). A group of eight goblin minions facing Kalynna (Paladin, back cover) might get 18, while the group of three human sailors facing Howl (Kobold Assassin, back cover) might get 13. If these minions have some special equipment, skills, advantage/disadvantage etc., I\u2019d adjust those values a bit. But I never plan this ahead, and don\u2019t use more than a few seconds for this decision. I don\u2019t tell the numbers to the players.<br/><br/>Next, I tell the players what is happening. Like "Kalynna, as the ship is starting to take off, eight goblin thugs spread out in a semi-circle, looking to overwhelm you on the shore. They\u2019re armed with scimitars and knives, and one of them has a crossbow. No armor. What\u2019s your plan?" Then I listen to Kalynna\u2019s player.  If she says she\u2019s just gonna try and get past super fast without trying to defeat all of them, I\u2019d let her use Dexterity. If she says she\u2019s going to use Kalynna\u2019s weapon skill and strength to kill them, I\u2019d let her use her total attack bonus + 10 as a stand in "combat attribute." If she says she\u2019s gonna rely mainly on her superior armor, letting this battle take its time, I\u2019d let her use her AAC. <br/><br/>Based on what she says, I\u2019d also decide on what\u2019s at stake. Like: "Each loser in this auction is gonna take 1d6 damage," or maybe "if you lose, you will still defeat the goblins, but you will be too late and you will take d6-2 damage." <br/><br/>Once this is done (about 30 seconds), me and Kalynna\u2019s player play out the auction using the regular auction rules, role-playing each bet:<br/><br/>Me: "I bet 2. The goblins rush you!"<br/>Kalynna: "5. I charge their flank!"<br/>Me: "7. The crossbow goblin fires at you."<br/>Kalynna: "9. I raise my shield crash into them."<br/>Me: "10. Two of them manage to get up behind you."<br/>Kalynna: "No more bids. I stand and fight."<br/>Me: "[I roll to get above 10 but under 18.] Crap. 9. You win. [I roll damage for each goblin.] All die but two, who run away wounded. Wanna describe it?"<br/>Kalynna: "Sure. Their knifes are too weak to penetrate my armor, so I take out the scimitar fighters first. The sand is black with goblin blood, and I laugh as I let the remaining knife-fighters encircle me \u2026"<br/><br/>When you write this down like I\u2019ve done above, it takes a lot words. But in reality, this scene would take maybe 2\u20133 minutes with zero planning, and the descriptions for each bid would likely be longer than what I've written above. There would still be some tactical choice involved in choosing strategy for the player characters and in placing the bids, but also room for free descriptions of cool scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424246/#Comment_424246" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-15T10:27:20+00:00" title="November 15, 2013 10:27AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A 13th Age character is race, class, some special talents, and the six usual ability scores used in a D20 way, but with no defined skill list. Instead, they get freeform backgrounds that encourage the player to make up shit about the setting and have it be True. "Ex-leader of the Emperor's Elite Dragon Guard +4." When you need to make a skill check, you explain how a background applies and roll as normal. Fictional positioning is everything here. It's all negotiation between players and GM to determine how a background applies. Yes, there's a certain amount of "every background is useful for everything" going on, but who cares? The idea is that your character has an avenue for being effective that plays to the character's history.<br/><br/>Characters also have built-in connections to the Icons, powerful non-deity NPCs in the world who are world-known by their role rather than their name. The Archmage. The Emperor. The Prince of Shadows. 13 icons and a default setting drawn in bold strokes are there for plundering by GM and player, but lots of GMs scrap that setting and create their own places and own Icons.<br/><br/>The setting itself is sorta D&amp;D but refuses to be normal. There are giant behemoths that wander in circles around the continent while people make homes on them. There is a Dwarf King who claims all treasures taken from underground belong to the dwarves. There is the suggestion that stars dock at a certain port in the Overworld. There are Living Dungeons that reconfigure and spawn monsters with evil, sentient purpose. Even if you scrap the setting and do your own thing, the text is encouraging you to be weird and do creative things.<br/><br/>The rest of the character talent stuff is somewhere between 3E and 4E (and almost entirely combat focused). Miniatures (and a battle map) are not required. Combat uses loose positioning (engaged, adjacent, nearby, far away) and people sometimes use minis in a loose way to mark positioning. There are no movement distance rules. You move around as needed. Combats, as a result, are very fast (in my experience, a little slower than Basic D&amp;D but faster than 3E and definitely faster than 4E).<br/><br/>The various magic systems for wizards and clerics and bards etc. have baked into them leeway for players to make shit up about effects. For example, a wizard can take the Vancian Magic talent, and whenever they cast a spell, the GM makes up an additional minor effect for each of their spells, each time one is cast. And each is supposed to be unique to the situation. Bards are encouraged to rename battle chants and reskin things to make sense for their characters. There are rules for turning normal combat spells into rituals that let casters do huge, grand, freeform magic.<br/><br/>There's a lot of text in the rules saying stuff like, "If you want to do something like steal a talent from another class, talk to your GM about it. GMs, don't let your players min-max and ruin the game, but let them do stuff if it's COOL."<br/><br/>The rules aren't that big. Probably about the size of Basic+Expert, except for the Classes chapter that comprises a big chunk, but really, each player needs to know only the rules for her own class. I GMed a lot of 13th Age without really knowing all the class rules at all. I just handed each player a copy of the class rules for whatever she was playing and she had to grok it herself.<br/><br/>The rules aren't too detailed, except in the class combat powers which give each class a unique flavor. Combat overall is streamlined compared to 3E or 4E. It reminds me a lot of Basic D&amp;D, but with more customization within each class. More like when 2E started giving Weapon Proficiencies to classes and fighters would get 3/2 attacks at 5th level, or some other special powers as they advanced. It feels like Old School with the sensibilities of modern game design.<br/><br/>(It's designed by Jonathan Tweet and Rob Heinsoo.)<br/><br/>I can talk about 13th Age all day, but I'll wait for more questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424247/#Comment_424247" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-15T10:47:36+00:00" title="November 15, 2013 10:47AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that auction mechanic, I really do!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424249/#Comment_424249" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-15T11:09:57+00:00" title="November 15, 2013 11:09AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I put my thoughts here about Whitehack <a href="http://githyankidiaspora.wordpress.com/2013/11/14/whitehack-first-pass-on-the-train-home-last-night/" rel="nofollow">onto my blog</a>, expanded just a touch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>OSR stuff that is catching my eye. - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18969/osr-stuff-that-is-catching-my-eye/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="OSR stuff that is catching my eye. - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18969/osr-stuff-that-is-catching-my-eye/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="I just realized that the descending AC works really well for the auction system as is.

I hate all the clutter of 2nd edition AD&amp;D and dont want to add to much mechanical complexity to the characters.  Simple and streamlined with a broad base idea of what the characters can do.   To be a Gladiator you dont need a gladiator class, your actions in combat will be colored in a gladiator fashion and if you do anything a gladiator would know how to do you get a bonus to it.  So maybe a race/background/occupation and class.  No split of magic using classes in Preservers/defilers/clerics/druids - maybe different spell lists.<br/><br/>I love the idea of Sorcerer Kings and Queens ruling the cities of the harsh world.  Building Ziggurats and other magnificent structures that are parts of magic rituals, while the slaves that are building the structures along with the entire populations of the cities have their life energy drained at night to power their rulers.  Gladiatorial games and bizarre creatures wandering the wastelands.  A real feel of monolithic power crushing those below them locked in struggles with their fellow rulers.  I want part of play to be about dungeon crawling, not just for random loot but for magical elements that the sorcerer kings need in their constructions and will pay well for.  The other part of play I want to focus on is the political situation.  I want to take some ideas from Stars without Numbers on how the world changes over time.  The different city states are warring with each other, both openly and subversively, the Veiled Alliance working to preserve the world, the Templars of each city maintaining order, escaped slave tribes, bandits, elf raiders, Thri-kreen, etc.  Something like the clocks from Apocalypse world where an accumulation of events can lead to events happening such as a Sorcerer King transforming into a Dragon and devouring his city.  <br/><br/>So what's out there in the OSR that I can scavenge.  There's going to be a lot of picking and choosing but any tools that would help or maybe even suggestions from outside the OSR.<br/> <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425129/#Comment_425129" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-03T12:51:06+00:00" title="December  3, 2013 12:51PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can see what you're going for, but as far as I know there aren't really any relevant OSR publications for it. This is because what you're looking for is systemic or mechanical material, and those are somewhat sparse on the ground in the OSR scene. Their strengths really lie more in adventure and campaign conception, generally speaking.<br/><br/>This is not to say that OSR folks don't do this sort of thing, it's just that the next step in the work is normally to write it all up as a masterful DM yourself - develop your tools, conceptions and content, stealing little bits and pieces from wherever. The end-result of that work will certainly be publishable - just look at the likes of <i>Carcosa</i> - but there's not much in a work like that to adapt to something else, I feel. The next guy with a new setting (Dark Sun in your case) will largely have to start from near scratch to attain that perfect fit of tools and color.<br/><br/>All that being said, if you feel that an example of how to structure your material and what kinds of things to prepare would be useful, then I recommend <i>Anomalous Subsurface Environment</i>; it has quite similar aesthetics to your vision, and it does a very good, very robust job of structuring the fiction into useful forms.

They published settings and adventure modules but they never really showed how to tie them together or how to make a game that went beyond entering the next dungeon.  They had a lot of implications, like getting a castle and followers but nothing really solid for what that big picture could look like or how or why it should matter.   That's one of the big things I want to put into the game, where the adventuring the characters are doing is affecting the world or possibly if they choose to ignore a certain dungeon it will allow the inhabitants to grow stronger and make more impact in the world.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425148/#Comment_425148" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-03T14:27:15+00:00" title="December  3, 2013  2:27PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vernon: Red Tide.

Heck, just look at Carcosa - it's the same genre, you could just swap some labels and replace the Mythos ritual magic with a homebrew nature-despoiling magic system (hopefully a more colorful and concrete one than the casually sterile TSR treatment), and there you go. Maybe hex-ify a Dark Sun map, too, but that's no big deal. I would personally definitely prefer a OSR Dark Sun (even be keen to play it, nothing wrong with DS as a setting) over a drama system treatment in the headspace I'm currently in.<br/><br/>The issue I was attempting to get at above was not that it's a bad fit, but rather that the OSR publishing pattern has not produced many products that are useful in adapting a setting for a campaign. They're all either bottom-up construction kits (where you start play and develop the setting as you go), or very specific settings themselves (like Vornheim, Carcosa, ASE, etc.), or general rules systems that rarely fit so well to a setting that you wouldn't be better off working from scratch. This has to do with the shunning of overt theory work in OSR circles, I'd have to guess - folks are usually more interested in creating something specific than understanding the patterns and techniques of creativity, so the end result is that you either "just do it", relying on real experience, or you use something somebody else "just did".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425444">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425444/#Comment_425444" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-07T11:27:45+00:00" title="December  7, 2013 11:27AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Oops, we're at that weird place where:<br/><br/>2) People are beginning to get digs in against the thing the thread is supposed to be about.

Now there are some awesome Dark Sun concepts that could be applied to OSR, like the character trees.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R" title="Vernon R"><img alt="Vernon R" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vernon%20R">Vernon R</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425475/#Comment_425475" name="Item_75" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-08T11:19:07+00:00" title="December  8, 2013 11:19AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<br/>What I want out of Dark Sun begins and ends with the original box set, I have no interest in the meta-plot and the changes that developed over time.  I think there is a lot in the setting as presented that works just fine in an old-school style of play.  I want the players to be challenged and whether they live or survive is up to them.  When and if they do survive I want their accomplishments to matter in the larger world and I think the world of Dark Sun is the perfect set up for a place where players can matter, as much as they can in your typical medieval fantasy Tolkienesque world. <br/><br/>When Dark Sun originally came out we were caught up in the ideas of the day and played illusionist/participationist railroaded storylines.  I dont want that, I want a game where the impartial gm sets up the world and let's it run how it should.  I'm looking for ideas that help create a system that make the world run without the gm needing to manipulate events to make things interesting.  There are so many interesting opposing factions at work, the different city states, elf tribes, rebellious slaves, preservers, defilers, Thri-kreen, bandits and enough open space to let the players build their own future while dealing with the powers that be.  I think it's perfect for old-school.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425591/#Comment_425591" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-09T13:06:05+00:00" title="December  9, 2013  1:06PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been reading <i>Mistborn </i>recently and it gives me a strong Dark Sun vibe, even though the settings aren't all that similar -- the theme of starting off with a frankly dystopian fantasy world and fighting to make it better is a great hook.  The grittiness of Dark Sun's world made it much more interesting for me also.  <br/><br/>Personally, I've been enjoying the OSR revival a lot, but at a distance; I've been grabbing individual OSR things, especially the LotFP stuff, and repurposing it for Dungeon World.  I didn't think I'd ever be up for OSR gaming after burning out on it so badly in the 80's, but this thread is making me reconsider.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18969/osr-stuff-that-is-catching-my-eye" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18969/osr-stuff-that-is-catching-my-eye" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18969/osr-stuff-that-is-catching-my-eye/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F18969%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F18969%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
