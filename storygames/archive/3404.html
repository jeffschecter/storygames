After reading through the game, I must say that I'm impressed. It looks like exactly what I was expecting.<br/><br/>But... I was surprised to find that the rules included a way to play for more than two. In fact, there is at least one Beast that <i>requires</i> there be multiple hunter characters in play. Not that this is a bad thing, far from it; it's cool to see that the game is actually <i>more</i> useful than I had initially believed.<br/><br/>Anyway, I was wondering if anyone here has actually used the game in this way (i.e. with multiple hunters). If you did, how did it go? How does it compare to the two-player set-up?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76866/#Comment_76866" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-20T21:05:47+00:00" title="June 20, 2007  9:05PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey there <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Glad you like the game!

One of the reasons I'm looking forward to moving back home is that I will be able to play RPGs with more than just my wife, for most of the same reasons you stated.<br/><br/>Let me ask about Teamwork - does it make a huge difference in effectiveness? I mean, I haven't had a chance to try it, but I wonder how much easier it makes big boss challenges... I've had an issue with how tough it can be for a single Hunter to take on challanges all by himself, and I've adjusted the Strike rules accordingly (I'm dyjoots on RPGnet, Christian), but I wonder if that would make a <i>group</i> of Hunters far too effective.<br/><br/>It's cool to see how excited people get about the game. I figure there is a lot of creative description going on... I like the encouragement to "stunt" (stealing a mainstream RPG term).

When Clinton and John H. really got going, I shifted into audience mode.  There was serious flow in that game, people were really achieving awesomeosis, and I didn't want to screw it up.  I kicked in a vorpal spell to JH, and that was pretty much my contribution to the whole game, and yet I still had a bitchin' time.<br/><br/>I have a question for Matt -- in our Beast Hunters endgame, when you helped me in my last two or three actions, how satisfying was that?   Did you get to have fun narration in there, or roll dice or anything?  Or were you just gifting me your +3 for me to do stuff with?  I can't remember really what happened. <br/><br/>The Beast Hunters multiplayer rules have an option for one Hunter to transfer advantage points to another Hunter, which requires either a convincing narration or a successful roll, but trait lending appears to just require that one player buy into another's action, no narration required.\n<blockquote>but I wonder if that would make a group of Hunters far too effective.</blockquote>\nOur setup didn't really have a big bad; we had four groups of bad guys to fight.  I accrued a sizable advantage on a phalanx of soldiers while some enemy commandos  were activating their traits.  Then the commandos attacked, and I was too busy with them to do anything to the soldiers, but Matt took them on..  Matt hurt the soldiers pretty badly and stayed fresh while I took some hits against the commandos.  Later, we both did a strike and then switched off, so I could finish off the weakened soldiers and he could bring his full wound track to bear against the commandos.  After the soldiers were dead, we combined to finish off the commandos.  At that point the outcome was not in doubt; it was just a matter of how it would be narrated.\n<blockquote>For the GPNW players (or Christian, whoever really), how much over-the-top action/narration was there?</blockquote>\nIt was all pretty much over the top.  My guy pushed a temple column down on the phalanx, scattering them badly and killing them.   I narrated friendly fire kills, caught javelins out of the air and used them as bludgeons in one smooth, sweeping motion, ran on the butts of upended javelins that lay embedded in the ground while decapitating the enemy on both sides, threw myself backwards into an open cellar to try to crush the woman-commando clinging to my back, and decapitated a midget general who was riding in a cupola on a giant's shoulders.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77633/#Comment_77633" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T20:55:16+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  8:55PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Haha!

But certain players tend to go that way anyway, and that is perfectly in line with how I like to play the game, because it allows for more creative narration. For example, in one of the playtests, they were also fighting a pack of wolf-like animals, though in the course of an adventure. One of the players made a fire and rained down burning pieces on them. Then the guy who played his own version of the huge, powerful barbarian kicked up one of the burning wolves into the air, grabbed him, and bashed the other wolves with their flaming friend!

I think the multiplayer almost brought out a competitive spirit as the warriors tried to top each other's awesome combos and action descriptions.  It was almost a little flustering for me as a newer player to these kinds of games, working with some masters. :-)  It took some getting used to, but I think next time I would be disembowling the elite commandos with their own weapons with the rest of the guys instead of fighting a pack of dumb war dogs!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n--Dan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthew_SB" title="Matthew_SB"><img alt="Matthew_SB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthew_SB">Matthew_SB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77645/#Comment_77645" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T21:29:13+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  9:29PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, by that point in the game I was riding a massive high of awesomness.  There was a constant stream of kick-ass narration, and I felt very fulfilled by my contributions in the game.  So I felt great being able to contribute to our group goals by giving up a small amount of narration at the end.  So, in my recollection, in the rounds I helped in my rolling was limited to just defense.  It probably helped that I had an awesome untouchable streak going with the dice there.  But really, while I didn't have as much narrative clout in the helping rounds, the transition from the solo fights to the joint efforts felt really awesome from both a tactical perspective and in terms of the story being told.  It was just very cool to <b>work together</b> to overcome the challenges.  So I'd say while my active contributions were reduced in those segments, it was still super satisfying.  And if it hadn't been, I certainly wouldn't have kept doing it!  Does that answer your questions, or have I gone off rambling?<br/><br/>That's interesting about the rule for transferring advantage.

I am especially worried that there are things that I say or do that make the demo work better that I haven't put in this document.
