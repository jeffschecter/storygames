You discuss what went right, and what went wrong. You face your mistakes, you take pride in your successes, and you plan for your next project. The key to a successful postmortem is the development of specific action items which will have a positive impact on your next project.<br/><br/>The optimistic nature of the concept, juxtaposed with the negative connotations of the word postmortem, always got to me. Consequently, I have decided to start calling these 'postpartums' instead. After all, we're not burying a project, we're giving it life.<br/><br/>I have decided to create a book. It's called <i><b>Postpartum: Lessons Learned</b></i>. Inspired in part by the one-year-later posts here and elsewhere, it consists of a series of interviews with small-press game developers whose projects have been on the shelf for at least a year. If that describes you (which is to say, if you created and published a game with your own money over a year ago), and if you're interested in being interviewed, please let me know.<br/><br/>The book will be published via Lulu sometime next year. All profits will go to <a href="http://www.toysfortots.org" rel="nofollow">Toys For Tots</a>. I don't have any artistic skill whatsoever, so if you're interested in contributing to the illustration or layout of the book, please let me know. There's no money in this, though. Sorry about that.<br/><br/><b>Goals</b><br/>The book will assemble knowledge culled from the trenches of independent development. For those who are considering self-publishing a game, <i><b>Postpartum</b></i> will be a concise but heartfelt repository of knowledge presented in an interview format.<br/><br/><b>Credentials</b><br/>I have some interviewing and editing experience. I edited <i><b>Game Design: A Practical Approach</b></i>, written by Paul Schuytema and published by Charles River Media. I also edited <b><i>The Great Mahjong Book: History, Lore, And Play</i></b>, written by Jelte Rep and published by Tuttle Publishing. I wrote <a href="http://www.courseptr.com/ptr_detail.cfm?group=Game%20Development&amp;subcat=General%20Topics&amp;isbn=1%2D58450%2D503%2D6&amp;CFID=23357907&amp;CFTOKEN=55024334" rel="nofollow">The Game Writing Handbook</a>, published by Charles River Media. The book features numerous interviews with video game writers, including the following:\n<ul>\n<li>Chris Avellone (<i>Neverwinter Nights 2, Planescape: Torment</i>)<br/></li><li>Mary DeMarle (<i>Myst 3: Exile, Homeworld 2</i>)<br/></li><li>Susan O'Connor (<i>BioShock, BlackSite: Area 51</i>)<br/></li><li>Mac Walters (<i>Jade Empire, Mass Effect</i>)<br/></li><li>Erik Wolpaw (<i>Psychonauts, Half-Life 2: Episode 1</i>)</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Process</b><br/>The interview process works like this:<br/><i><b>Recorded/transcribed:</b></i> We meet face-to-face, or we talk over the phone. I ask questions, which you answer. I record the conversation, then transcribe it and clean the text up. I forward it to you for evaluation and revision.<br/><i><b>Email:</b></i> I email you the questions, which you answer. I proofread the text, then forward it to you for evaluation and revision.<br/><i><b>Instant messenger:</b></i> I ask you questions, which you answer. I save the conversation and clean the text up. I forward it to you for evaluation and revision.<br/><br/><b>Questions</b><br/>I'm not going to rake you over the coals ("When did you first realize that you're a deviant?"). My goal is to ask questions about the self-publishing process. I will ask questions about your game's design, focusing on the core question of whether your book hit the mark that you were aiming for. I will also be asking questions  about publication, concerning subjects like binding, print-on-demand, marketing, web sites, message boards, illustration, paper quality, and distribution. Part of my job will be putting together a specific list of questions for each interview subject, since there's no point in asking you about artwork if your book doesn't feature any.<br/><br/>If you want in, whisper me. If you have questions, you can whisper them or post them here.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98797/#Comment_98797" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T18:09:22+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  6:09PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd buy that!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98862/#Comment_98862" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T03:21:03+00:00" title="September 25, 2007  3:21AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 25, 2007 3:22AM by Rafael.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>I'd buy that!</blockquote>\nGood to hear!<br/><br/>Someone asked (via whisper) if his game were relevant enough to merit an interview, given that the book was released well over a year ago.

The catalyst was this RPG.net thread where someone was asking about the Forge. And I pointed out that the Forge was extremely useful to me when I started working on my own game, about five years ago. The Forge was this amazing resource because it was full of testimonials and firsthand accounts and best-practices information and so forth. Now, of course, you can find such material at a number of different message boards -- it's not just the Forge anymore, though it's still a place I visit on a regular basis -- but it occurred to me that it might also be immensely useful (to veteran game designers and novices alike) to have a book of interviews with published designers about their experiences. <br/><br/>So there you are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98956/#Comment_98956" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T11:01:23+00:00" title="September 25, 2007 11:01AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing to consider is topicality - 18 months ago, for example, I would have waxed poetic about the awesome that was RPI, but today not only are they gone, but the company that devoured them isn't that great.

While there's much to be said for specificity during a postpartum, I don't want any part of this book to be perceived on an attack on any person or institution. <br/><br/>So, for that reason, I'd rather leave that level of detail out of the book altogether. If an interviewee wants to talk about the time that he or she hired a cover artist who did a terrible job, that's fine (because it can serve as a cautionary tale), but it's not necessary to cite names in order to communicate the lessons that were learned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98987/#Comment_98987" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T12:16:44+00:00" title="September 25, 2007 12:16PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a guy who designs videogames by day and frets over indie RPGs by night, I applaud your decision to try this.

And there are always tiny startups and IGF projects that might have just enough punk rock attitude (and/or lack of business sense) to be brutally honest about their own work. To that end, you could get interviews with boardgame designers (Dragons of Kir?) and so on (Anybody ever interview the guys who change the rules to American football every season? Might be interesting to get a postmortem from them). When you've got your interviews collected, you might be surprised at how relevant it is to anyone interested in a facet of game design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99014/#Comment_99014" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-25T12:54:23+00:00" title="September 25, 2007 12:54PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn.
