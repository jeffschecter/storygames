I intend to use a reputation economy (after a fashion). However I need to balance this out so players don't end up earning too much or too little. The model is similar to what you see in games like Weapons of the GOds. Each character has a Virtue - Justice, Loyalty, Bravery, Tradition, or Kindness - with an associated score. When they abide by that virtue during play they earn rep equal to it's score. However I am concerned that certain virtues will be more playable than others - Justice for instance is likely to trigger more often due to being an action oriented milieu. Virtue scores will simply be increased with xp; the alternative would be for it to increase through virtuous behaviour but that conflicts with the earning of rep. <br/><br/>There must be a few readers familiar with those games/systems that know whether or not this might work and why not? <br/>I never got the chance to run WotG. More than anything, this needs to be a simple system. Not an exercise in behavioural engineering number crunching or minmaxing.<br/><br/>Thanks.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_430916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/szp" title="szp"><img alt="szp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/191/n7DTE2GEA3S70.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/szp">szp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430916/#Comment_430916" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-13T19:10:32+00:00" title="April 13, 2014  7:10PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Instead of accruing reputation points based on a Virtue's score, you could simply award a point based on an act in line with a Virtue. The Virtue score could provide reputation points at the start of the game and/or after downtime. Instead of a Virtue being how quickly a character gains reputation, they could be guidelines. An act of Justice should be valued the same regardless of how Just a character is, in my limited opinion.<br/><br/>What purpose does reputation serve, by the way?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430920/#Comment_430920" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-13T23:51:48+00:00" title="April 13, 2014 11:51PM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2014 11:52PM by AsIf.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I second <a href="/forums/profile/szp%27s">@szp's</a> suggestion, but add: Perhaps you award points on a scale based on how big or public the virtuous act was.

After much argument both parties agreed that they should be judged on virtue of their size by the people of the land. The prideful Ox knew that his victory was inevitable, he was obviously the largest animal and so offered no objection went the Rat petitioned Lord Buddha to double his size - the Ox was still a hundred times larger even so! However, when the two animals walked amongst the people no one paid any attention to the Ox, for he was simply a regular Ox but everyone expressed astonishment at Rat. "What a huge rat!" "The biggest!" And so this is how the Rat comes to lead the Zodiac, by virtue of his size.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to get at here is that if a character has a prior reputation for justice or bravery ("The warriors of the Tiger Clan are always brave!") then virtuous action along that line only serves to keep a reputation rather than enhance it. If our Tiger Clan swordsman is brave, all is as it should be, but if he's observed acting with great kindness then perhaps that's where a personal reputation is founded? Default cultural virtues VS. personal traits?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_430924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/430924/#Comment_430924" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-14T02:22:50+00:00" title="April 14, 2014  2:22AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is about a reputation economy.

Perhaps each vendor has an affinity to a given Virtue that rewards or benefits those looking to trade with it. But I think it might be better to have the goods and services on offer classified according to Virtue and have the hero use that virtue to acquire stuff. For example: if you want a new gun, you need Justice. If you want your starship repaired you need Tradition (for systems and tech), if you want medicine you need Loyalty. <br/><br/>Perhaps the affinity works thus: if you want to buy a gun and you also want your Justice virtue a little higher then find a Justice merchant (obviously they are more likely to be arms traders than others, but not necessarily). He will then offer you a job or contract of some kind that, if fulfilled, allows you to earn something toward increasing your Justice score. Needless to say that task is affiliated in nature.<br/><br/>I would be reluctant to have asystem where heroes can improve their virtues easily since it would be rather self defeating. Instead I would punish them for transgressing.

They don't get them for simply being heroes; if you're Virtue is Justice then pursuing it should be the norm.

Dish out some street justice to spoiled rich kids hassling the underclass and suddenly you're up to Justice: Laborer.  Wherever you go, your reputation precedes you.

You can call on them for a quick lynch mob, or advice on where to find unlicensed guns in the city, or street cops turning a blind eye to technical infractions.  They wouldn't be able to introduce you to Forgemaster Sif, he who knows the fabled secret of Damascus gunbarrels, but they could introduce you to his servant and maybe you could do his servant a little favor, a little side-quest...?  And of course you have to maintain your rank by continuing just and impartial treatment of the labor castes, and defend it when the rich little snotrag hires a couple of men-at-arms to teach you a lesson, or you might end up ranked at Beggar because the Laborers now consider you a flash-in-the-pan, but the Beggars have heard the stories and think maybe, just maybe...<br/><br/>Iunno, in wuxia the virtues are an absolute.

I also don't think there's enough parity between them; combat is going to favour Justice and probably Bravery, but how do you differentiate between them? Having to answer questions like that every time is just going to be a chore. It may be easier just to have a single trait, like renown in Qin Warring States, and use that.

It sounded like you were describing a setup where "if you want an awesome gun, build up your Justice virtue, because those virtuous in Justice are the ones handing out awesome guns".

It comprised many warrior and martial fraternities who would represent factions within the kingdom, fighting on their behalf to resolve differences and ensure that civil war didn't erupt. A system of honour and ritual surrounded these contests. This system placed noble virtues above mere ambition, greed and destruction and was administered by elders of the community. The merchants of today use this system in place of hard currency.<br/><br/>This is an abstraction. It is as much a fantastical concept with as much explanation as people in wuxia flying over buildings. There is no way this could work in real life since trade on the basis of virtue and honour wouldn't work; a reputation economy is the closest model. The science behind it is irrelevant: virtue isn't 'transmitted' like credits for example. The system simply exists.<br/><br/>So heroes will accrue 'credit' in this system through their virtue and their deeds. Just as the virtue systems earn rewards in WotG/LotW. However I simply don't want an action oriented, high flying, setting to get bogged down in which virtue is what and checking how many points doing x earns. <br/><br/>This isn't a case where, for example, Just warriors have a monopoly on guns. It's an abstraction, it's flavour. How do they get the guns in the first place? Who cares; he probably traded them likewise. A warrior who wants a gun trades in his reputation, his honour, his virtue because these are palpable qualities in wuxia. Unfortunately translating that into a game system is harder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Veav" title="Veav"><img alt="Veav" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/007/n3BMK8VFYEJK8.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Veav">Veav</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431093/#Comment_431093" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-16T06:58:42+00:00" title="April 16, 2014  6:58AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2014 7:05AM by Veav.">edited April 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Just to clarify, I didn't mean to imply you have to go to Justice to get a gun.

Under most circumstances, nothing on the equipment list (and it's a normal equipment list, pots and pans and ten-foot-poles) can be acquired with currency or barter, but must be acquired through this abstraction of virtue?  I'm not judging this one way or the other, just trying to grasp the scope.<br/><br/>Going back to "tell me a story" - can you walk me through a sequence where a character decides they want a gun, are told they cannot "afford" one, performs some activity to change that, then comes back and acquires a gun?  In trad form, that might be: "Alice walks into Bob's gun shop.  Bob says, gun is 50 zennys.  Alice only has 30 zennys.  Bob says, no gun for you!  Alice leaves and borrows 20 zennys from a friend/steals 20 zennys from a stranger/beats up goblins with 20 zennys in their pockets/does the dishes and gets paid 20 zennys.  Alice comes back and displays 50 zennys.  Bob says, here is gun, thank you for business."  In the virtuous frame...?<br/><br/>(I know it's an abstraction.

Exalted is a particularly apt example; you have a handful of dots to distribute among four virtuous traits, then you can buy more with the character creation points everyone gets (that also can go towards skills, backgrounds, etc.), or later on with XP rewarded for participation and hitting waypoints.  It's especially apt because one of those backgrounds is Resources (a combination of liquid cash and general assets), which uses an identical abstraction of dots, so there's an immediate cross-reference to purchasing power.  See if you can leaf through the core book in your LGS!<br/><br/>We're back on characters accumulating virtue over time, not being explicitly rewarded or penalized for specific behaviors, but that's really the only way to avoid bean-counting or justifying one virtue's application over another.  And as the GM, you have the authority to say "You want to spend XP on upgrading your Justice?  You've been really un-Just lately, what with all those orphan puppies you've been kicking.  Denied."  "But they were evil puppies!"  "Deal with it."<br/><br/>Now I'm going to offer some different, unsolicited advice.  I apologize up front if I'm misrepresenting you, your responses, or your creative process, it's just how it feels on this end and I want to lay it out there.<br/><br/>The proposition up top is "wuxia space opera, five virtues with in-setting applications, reputation economy"... it's a wonderful idea, a great elevator pitch, but not specific.  My natural inclination is to start riffing on that, to try filling in blanks and say - from my perspective, in a game where your virtues are your wealth, where your reputation is what you're worth as a man, what might that look like?<br/><br/>Then, what I think happens is: the setting you have imagined is <i>very</i> specific.  It's not something like Apocalypse World that's massively open to interpretation, it's something like- hah- World of Darkness games with well-defined imagery, lore, and expectations.  You've been developing this and thinking about it and laying down foundations.  You know what you're after.<br/><br/>The result is, it's a loop of: you offer an unspecific line of inquiry, I build on it and ask questions to clarify and riff on potential details (and some of them are <i>natural</i> assumptions, wuxia is martial arts, having the virtues feed into fighting mechanics is the <i>first</i> thing people are going to assume), you focus on shooting down the parts that are "wrong" without addressing the parts that could be applicable.  It shuts down the conversation rather than engaging with it.  I keep seeing "isn't", "not", "doesn't", "no", and not a lot of "what if..." or "so what I'd imagined..."  It's like you've had this conversation already in your head and I'm not feeding you the lines you expected.<br/><br/>So you've got my no-riff advice up top, but I don't know if it completes your puzzle; I've only seen the one piece so far, and the handful of other pieces you've said won't fit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_431116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart" title="James_Stuart"><img alt="James_Stuart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/915/nSUZ3SRAQ8WPY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">James_Stuart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431116/#Comment_431116" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-16T11:50:43+00:00" title="April 16, 2014 11:50AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Ghostwhistler. I'm just going to apply a gentle touch here.<br/><br/>You've had other threads that have had a fairly open-ended asks "reputation economy for virtues", "armor/weapon system", "how to handle multiple players in a combat". <br/><br/>You generally give only a small window, if any, of the surrounding mechanics (if they exist yet). Usually a few guidelines.<br/><br/>That's all fine. But I think you've got to recognize that when you've got that kind of openendedness, when people engage, they're going to be suggesting a lot of different stuff, because you haven't limited the space very much.<br/><br/>The problem comes that you seem to have a lot of very specific, immediate (mostly negative) responses to what people suggest. What I think this means is that you're not providing enough context (as in, you should be exposing as much as you can of the surrounding system), or you're not articulating your guidelines strongly enough.<br/><br/>Otherwise, you're just asking people to chip in and then largely burning their work.<br/><br/>So when you ask your next question, I'd try to offer more frame, or better understand what you yourself are looking for.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_431154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler" title="ghostwhistler"><img alt="ghostwhistler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ghostwhistler">ghostwhistler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/431154/#Comment_431154" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-04-17T00:39:29+00:00" title="April 17, 2014 12:39AM">April 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the problem here is that people perceive a request such as mine as an invitation to complete redefine, as they see it and to their design preferences, what idea the person is looking to discuss.

Alluded to, perhaps. See, we really like your idea of a Wuxia Space Opera and want to get to the meat of your game - the colour, the motivation, the procedures - see what you're doing, then try help expand thinking about Virtues and see what angles we can approach it from. The system might seem cut-and-dry to you but it's fresh data to us and we're keen to chip-in with alternative viewpoints. I wouldn't have typed up a Taoist parable on the nature of Virtue if I wasn't <i>really </i>keen on thinking over your ideas. I'm not, however, a mechanic - I'm simply not much help when it comes to checking if a point-economy works correctly or anything like that. It's not that requesting this kind of specific help is against the rules or spirit of the forum, it's only that 1-in-10 responses will be so focused: Story Games, we meander and pontificate - sorry if that's not useful right now, please don't get cross with us.
