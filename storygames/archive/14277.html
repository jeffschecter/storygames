I see that similar discussions about historical games have happened in S-G. MountZionRyan is bouncing ideas about this <a href="http://www.therpghaven.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=1589" rel="nofollow">here</a>, keeping the discussion open but with an eye for his Dokkodo game (lethal samurai rpg during the Edo period). I was especially interested in the question of conveying the subtleties of Japanese culture in a digestible/playable manner. I'm far, far, far from knowledgeable in this domain, but I love the tidbits I've absorbed (through movies mostly).<br/><br/><br/>What I wish a game could achieve is depict these awesome moments in fiction when social cues send  messages that differ or contradict dialogs. Example: a samurai visits his daimyo, the dialog is very polite and codified, and at first it looks like he's a happy loyal vassal paying his dues to his master. But then the author, or a third character, explains that in fact something else was at play entirely. The samurai did a gesture that breached the protocol and silently but intentionally insulted his lord. And then it goes for a long explanation of the ins and outs of the whole situation. What the protocol expected, what the deviation meant, why the lord kept a smiling face though he was offended. <br/><br/>I love those moments that make me peek into this very foreign culture. But it's very difficult to transpose into gaming. The external voice, explaining the obfuscated side of the social scene, would make the game crawl and players would probably start to wonder wtf they're doing at this table.<br/><br/>So maybe it's time for some abstraction? Let's get the complexity out of the picture. Rare are those who will read ten books about tea ceremony, kabuki and court protocol in order to depict these subtle social exchanges. But we can be aware that they happen a lot in a feudal Japanese rpg (or maybe another setting with similar phenomenons). So why not a game mechanic for this?<br/><br/>One that would be easy peasy would be to use writing slates. Players would speak in character their official speech while writing completely different things on their slates. <br/>Player A vocally "Hi Kazuki san! How are you doing today?" <br/>Player A on the slate "Are you still mad at me for my mistake of yesterday?"<br/>Player B vocally "Hi Fumiko chan! I feel great. It's because the cherry trees are blooming. It makes my heart sing"<br/>Player B on the slate "Leave me alone and don't piss me off. I'm still upset about yesterday's fiasco"<br/><br/>What other way could we play with double language at the game table ?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_324150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324150/#Comment_324150" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T13:14:22+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  1:14PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have player C, assigned at the beginning of the scene, deliver the context of each portion of speech.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324155/#Comment_324155" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T13:25:56+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  1:25PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How is this different from having the players say what their characters mean?

(she wasn't disadvantaged, by the way, she was just airheaded and easily distracted)<br/><br/>So...to the point of gaming, how about using those signs, or maybe cards, that can be held up or something, so that while you are speaking as your character, saying one thing, it will become apparent that there is some double-meaning or undertone related to your dialogue?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tj333" title="tj333"><img alt="tj333" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tj333">tj333</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324165/#Comment_324165" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-12T14:07:14+00:00" title="May 12, 2011  2:07PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the sign idea.

(At least, it did in all the con games of it that I've played.)  This generally didn't get used for several scenes, then one person would get the bright idea to use it in a particularly talky scene, and then everyone would be using it throughout emotional/melodramatic scenes.  And a lot more depth could be conveyed this way.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><a href="http://nickwedig.libraryofhighmoon.com/2010/12/house-of-masks/" rel="nofollow">My old Game Chef game</a> has PCs split into two halves of their personality, which are played by different people.  For one character, one player can only tell the truth, while the other can only lie.  So simply by trading off which player was in control/speaking at a given moment, you could convey key information about how honest the character was being at the moment.  <br/><br/>Which is sort of along the lines of Mark's suggestion.  You could easily have a secondary player for each PC, who describes the subtext of every action mentioned by the primary player.  Or several secondary players, each of whom represents some subconscious or repressed desires of the PC.  So a conversation between two PCs would be like two simultaneous games of <a href="http://www.interactivitiesink.com/larps/download/trnt.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Road Not Taken</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_324279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/324279/#Comment_324279" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-13T05:28:35+00:00" title="May 13, 2011  5:28AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Jeepform technique Bird-in-Ear could also be a way into this.

I'm thinking of how it feels to have the knife on the table in Mist-Robed Gate, though that doesn't have the same effect.  Bird in the ear, or having another player play that subtext would be very effective. <br/><br/>Also, something like the language of flowers could be used to introduce the meaning through the game text. Frex, if given the samurai example everyone could be given a sheet of or briefing on etiquette cues. So then you could describe them happening and have everyone at the table gasp. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Something like that would be great in one of my Game Chef games, <a href="http://www.blackgreengames.com/free/cotm.pdf" rel="nofollow">City of the Moon</a>.

Then every time I mention one of those elements, it conveys additional, non-literal meanings to what is described.
