Very often, we improvisers will refuse to change, saying "By my character wouldn't do that!" We share this misconception with our colleagues in scripted theater. Well, guess what? Your character is capable of doing anything - which is the premise of theater. And the most interesting theater is predicated on the promise that the audience will see people behaving <i>out</i> of character. That's how you get a play like Agnes of God, where a young, devoted nun kills her own baby. Nobody would pay money to see a two-hour exploration of a day in the life of a real nun: prayers, work, meals, prayers, bedtime.</blockquote>\nAside from my amusement that RPGs aren't the only form that has to deal with the "my guy" problem, I found the contention that audiences like to see people act out of character interesting. Could this be true in RPGs as well? I've had a few experiences that seem to confirm this for me at least.

Irrevocable change is cool.  It makes stories.  The very possibility of it provides interest.  Decisions that you can't back away from once you've made are awesome fodder for stories - in fact, I'd say that's what stories are - a trail of irrevocable changes to a character and the context in which they are made.  Anything which alters a character in the context of what's happening around them is neat.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, a character blatantly acting out of character, with no context for it, no justification or, leaves you with... what?  Especially in roleplaying games, where we're explicitly creating something which has no representation, I think it's important for players to be mostly on the same page.  If your character is provoked by a decision and does something weird, that's one thing.  Having a character do something weird unprovoked - by which I mean without context - is extremely disruptive.  It can be great - if I believe there's a context and some kind of meaning behind it, and if I wasn't relying on that context not existing for my own enjoyment of the game/story.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven in media, though, this is important.  When we watch a TV show, we're participating with it in that same process.  We're letting it tell us a story and that story is building up in our minds, piling up momentum and detail from all the episodes before, until everything that the characters do is meaningful in the context of the past and has ramifications for the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the rules may be different for, say, a dungeon crawl, where people taking the most tactically sound option , but I'd postulate that part of the 'character' you're actually playing in such games is your own tactical wherewithal.  Again, players around you will build up an expectation of your character based on how competent you seem to be at the miniatures wargaming part of it, and how much you tend to modify your perception of the best tactical option based on the personality of your character.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, your mileage may vary.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Possibly related:  I have, in the past, been pretty irritated while playing board games (say, Settlers or Puerto Rico) when someone would decide that they were going to play for different stakes.  "I'm going to get the most stone!" they'd say, or decide that some other player's strategy was degenerate and needed to be actively screwed up, at the expense of doing the best they could at the game.  Of course, given the nature of a lot of these games, the ramifications of their decisions would alter the game for other players, disrupting their plans, etc.  I found these times when players would essentially decide to change their own goals in the game to be frustrating and disruptive, because all of a sudden my assumptions about the game and my ability to actually think ahead were seriously affected.  I couldn't anticipate what they might do, and so it felt as though I might as well not be playing the game with them.  A lot of the actual gameplay decisions they made weren't any different than things I've seen done by bad or inexperienced players - but I didn't get irritated at the inexperienced ones, because I hadn't built up any expectations about them, and I felt that they were still trying to be in the same game.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62296/#Comment_62296" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-27T15:09:42+00:00" title="March 27, 2007  3:09PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, Navi.<br/><br/>Here's what I assumed you were going to say, which is similar but different: acting out of character is neat in stories when it is an irrevocable change, where something prompts a character to stop being one person and start being another.  It's a very powerful way of displaying character development and narrative progress.  However, when players "act out of character" but it's not an actual change -- in other words, they then go back to 'normal' -- then it's something of a letdown.  There is no change, there's just breaking character for convenience, and then trying to continue as if nothing had changed.<br/><br/>I encountered this a LOT in online games with PC leaders who would want to make draconian decisions that would preserve their political position and would then want to turn around and be everybody's best friend again after they were petty despots a moment ago.

Especially in roleplaying games, where we're explicitly creating something which has no representation, I think it's important for players to be mostly on the same page.  If your character is provoked by a decision and does something weird, that's one thing.  Having a character do something weird unprovoked - by which I mean without context - is extremely disruptive.  It can be great - if I believe there's a context and some kind of meaning behind it, and if I wasn't relying on that context not existing for my own enjoyment of the game/story.<br/></blockquote>\nThis sounds logical, but I don't know if I buy it in practice.   Sigourney Weaver said that one thing she learned from playing Ripley; is that there is no need to try to make a character consistent; from scene to scene.  Make her tough as nails here, and then scared of her own shadow there, and thoughtful next, and then careless, gregarious, anti-social... <br/><br/>Rather than find it implausible or confusing; the audience finds the character to have the depth of a real person.  And they fill in their own explanations for the variation they see.  And they probably pick whatever aspect resonates with them personally-- and decide THAT is the 'real' essence of the character.\n<blockquote><br/>Even in media, though, this is important.  When we watch a TV show, we're participating with it in that same process.  We're letting it tell us a story and that story is building up in our minds, piling up momentum and detail from all the episodes before, until everything that the characters do is meaningful in the context of the past and has ramifications for the future.<br/></blockquote>\nThe long-running serial form-- with flawless continuity-- is unusual, in the history of storytelling.  And yet it is considered to be the norm, when gamers talk about campaigns, and TV series and movie sequels and novel trilogies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This is only a rough notion, but I wonder if it is the players' limited expectations which prevent them from enjoying characters which are more unpredictable than the players expected?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62888/#Comment_62888" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-04T06:59:43+00:00" title="April  4, 2007  6:59AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So if in Return of the King, Aragorn had--without provocation, corruption, or any other outside influence--decided to give up, or to kill his friends, or to sleep with orks, the audience would have thought that that was the real essence of the character and applauded the writers for the depth of his personality? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I just, for the life of me, cannot understand how people can think that characters have no personality, no identity, nothing that makes them who they are, and that they can just do anything without any justification at all.

We never see the inner lives of our fellow human beings. We guess about them based on their actions. If a person does something "out of character", we often say that we can't understand it, can't accept it... but none the less, they've gone and done it. "He seemed so nice and normal."<br/><br/>The story where Aragorn gives up, or turns to evil isn't <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. But I can imagine that story. It doesn't seem all that much of a stretch, actually. Now, the orc thing? I'd really need to see that. Maybe it's self-loathing, a rebellion against his destiny, a really cute orc, a dark enchantment?

That's a guy who is sweating with the difficulty of trying to <i>act</i> one way but <i>be</i> another.

I mean, just look at Nanowrimo and all the stories that come out of that, where people just write whatever comes to their mind--they are on the same level of character involvement as the best Shakespeare plays and literary bestsellers, right? There really must be no rhyme or reason to why some literary characters are popular and everlasting and others fall flat, and the difference between plot-driven and character-driven really is non-existent, even though people talk about it all the time.<br/><br/>Same for setting, I assume. If I just have aliens show up in the middle of a historical romance, people are going to make their own justifications and no one's going to feel cheated.

Curly is pointing out that seeing actual justification is unnecessary, and in fact audiences prefer to fill in the blanks themselves. But this in fact implies that <i>the character actions are justifiable</i>, as Christian said. Justifiable: able to be justified. It's important that the possibility exists, not that the action explicitly takes place <i>in advance</i>, or as part of the story text. And not that the justification is done by one or another person.<br/><br/>Now, there was also something about "when that justification is missing or bad", which is maybe what Curly was responding to. I think it makes more sense to say "when that justification seems impossible" or whatever, but it's mostly just wording at that point. It's not that the story lacks an actual justification, it's that it not only lacks a justification (which is usually a good thing), but in fact there appears to be no justification available -- usually meaning that the action is at odds with what previous actions suggest, etc. etc. <br/><br/>Personally I think roleplaying gamers are a little too wrapped up in concrete, actual justification -- thus the "it's what my character would do" phrase in the first place. It's kind of like reading a story where you have the author sitting there right in front of you, and whenever you want you can just break off reading and go "explain this! that makes no sense!" It feels like there's a lack of trust in our fellow-gamers going on, and I experience it myself for sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly" title="Call Me Curly"><img alt="Call Me Curly" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Call%20Me%20Curly">Call Me Curly</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63054/#Comment_63054" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-05T13:37:29+00:00" title="April  5, 2007  1:37PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2007 3:23PM by Call Me Curly.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12877.phtml" rel="nofollow">Noumenon</a> is an rpg where the ultimate arbiter of meaning<br/>resides among each player's own subconscious associations.<br/><br/>Other quality storytelling which refuses to rationalize causality: Paul Auster, Kurt Vonnegut, Kenneth Anger, Kurt Cobain, Samuel Beckett, Charlie Kaufman, Don Delillo, Thomas Pynchon, G.G.

With no ambiguous human element.)<br/><br/>More concretely, it applies to rpgs in deciding how to frame scenes, and in deciding whether a game really needs 'realistic' rules for gravity which make scientific sense,<br/>vs. genre-logic rules for kung-fu feats, which make emotional sense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jasper%20Polane" title="Jasper Polane"><img alt="Jasper Polane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jasper%20Polane">Jasper Polane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63085/#Comment_63085" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-06T00:32:46+00:00" title="April  6, 2007 12:32AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>There's a great book on writing called A Story Is A Promise that talks in depth about how we create expectations in readers through our writing, such as establishing the genre AND the characters, and any deviation needs to be within the promised parameters and be well justified.</blockquote>\nThere's a reason the writers of these books are known as "script gurus" as opposed to, I don't know, script <i>writers</i>.

Let's step back from all these generalizations and claims about absolute truths for a moment.<br/><br/>I am telling you, on a genuine basis, that *I* feel cheated if the writer has the character do unjustifiable things. If *I* feel that way, surely there are other people who feel that way--I am not that unique. Can we agree on that?

The author may through a variety of mechanisms, implicit or explicit, attempt to justify and explain what their character has done. Or, they may not, leaving it entirely up to the audience to form a psychological model of the character's mind in their own interpretation.<br/><br/>Each audience member has their own personal threshold for how much justification they need before they can believe in a character as a psychological entity, as opposed to a puppet of the author. They also have varying levels of willingness to do this justification themselves rather than having it laid out for them.<br/><br/>You know "willing suspension of disbelief", where it's all about doing enough to allow your audience to believe that This Could Be So? It's exactly like that. Some people have no tolerance for anything that's made-up - others will entertain even the wildest of hypothetical notions. Similarly, some people will happily countenance very strange psychologies which accommodate nigh-arbitrary actions - others won't, or will at least demand that seemingly arbitrary actions be sufficiently well-explained.<br/><br/>That we disagree about this stuff is no bad thing. Indeed, differing interpretation is actually one of the joys of fiction, and one of the ways in which it is most revelatory about your mind and the minds of others.<br/><br/>All you can do is be aware of everyone else's aesthetic standards, and insofar as such is important to you, attempt to satisfice them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63312">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63312/#Comment_63312" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-09T12:48:36+00:00" title="April  9, 2007 12:48PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, Thomas.
