Heartbreaking.<br/><br/>If it's the latter, you have all the tools to engineer that little tragedy.  Horrible.<br/><br/>Either way, fun.<br/><br/>It's interesting to watch how players use their Anchors as play continues, especially if their position changes on whether they want that relationship to go or fall.  Especially if there's petty jealousy dramas going on, which, is almost inevitable because you've got a bunch of youth under immense stress living in a near Lord of the Flies situation.  Heroism, then, is overcoming the worst, and petty within humanity, and still finding a way to get the job done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216903/#Comment_216903" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T09:15:57+00:00" title="July  7, 2009  9:15AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>let's talk about how creepy the naming rules...</blockquote>\n<b><br/>Yes, very</b>. In both a gimmicky way, but also a very very profound way. In short, I think they are awesome and make you feel the relationship at a ball-punching gut level. <br/><br/>Ever play Wraith by White Wolf? Don't worry, no one else has, either. But everyone who has <i>read</i> the book has done the following (based on an informal survey of myself, some friends, and about a dozen strangers at a con familiar with Wraith):<br/><br/>"I wonder what I would look like as a Wraith character?"<br/>(stats self up)<br/>"Now, I wonder what my Shadow (personal voice/antagonist) would look like?"<br/>(stats up shadow, basing the shadow on themselves)<br/>...<br/>...<br/>...<br/>(20 minutes later, crying while in fetal position in corner of room with blanket half-covering body)<br/>"Mommy... Mommy, I should have called you..."<br/><br/>Very visceral reaction to bringing yourself into a game. In Wraith, people just sort of did it without meaning to, and hit that fucking emo explosion. In Bliss Stage, you're meant to: It's directed enough so that you don't end up crying in a corner, but it still delivers a gut punch.

If that's not it, please clarify the profound awfulness.<br/><br/>So, in running a mission, there's only so many dice to distribute.  Losing control of the dream is a nasty, nasty thing.  So is failing a mission goal, or damaging a relationship.<br/><br/>The authority the anchor has is to make things seem like they're going awesome, except that we don't really know what's actually going on until the dice hit the table, and we see what's safe and what's risked.  So it's a little bit of a shell game.  The anchor is guiding, to the best they know how, the pilot towards the mission goals while keeping them sane and stable.  Except that they might be wrong.  In fact, they probably are wrong, because you can't get everything right.<br/><br/>So in essence, the anchor is trying to lie so much and so well that everyone, including the anchor, falls for it.  I think realizing this is the key to good anchor play.  When you get characters in the fiction also realizing this, then you've really got gold.<br/><br/>The names thing is there to help make the game immediate and visceral and creepy.  It's actually creepy in two ways.  One is if you pick the name of a crush, it's creepy as intended.  If you wimp out and lie, then you spend the whole game with that lie, <i>just like an anchor</i>.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure the incest rule is there because in playtest, people kept asking, and Ben kept having to say "No, you can't get more intimate than sex.  Even if it's your sister."  Creepy, but for a kinda different reason...<br/><br/>James                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216972/#Comment_216972" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-07T11:36:09+00:00" title="July  7, 2009 11:36AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>what?</blockquote>\nIt's like a soap opera is fun.

The real rule is actually "no intimacy 6 relationships." Intimacy 6 relationships are more powerful than I wanted in the game. You can have all the incest you want but you don't get more powerful than 5 intimacy.<br/><br/>Why it's there: Incest comes up a lot in Bliss Stage games (not necessarily "actually" happening in the fiction, but people talk about it, think about it, and sometimes plan about it.) And the natural interpretation (6 intimacy) is non-fun. So there has to be a rule.<br/><br/>As for anchor names, if your entire group is really squeamish*, and your name is Shreyas, use the default names but change them to a the gender of someone you had a crush on in high school. Change like: Nathan to Nathalia, Jenny to James, etc. Consider that errata.<br/><br/>The actual role of anchors in the game? Other people explain better than I do.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben<br/><br/>* It occurs to me that if you're really sqeamish about personal revelation, you're better off playing a game which is not Bliss Stage. But maybe you're squeamish about personal revelation except via the mask of fiction.

And, frankly, if there's a mechanical incentive to do something in a game, especially in an indie game, it's probably often accurate to assume that the game designer <i>wants</i> you to play that way.  I, personally, would be more creeped out if I thought Ben was encouraging me to have my character engage in incest.<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>I'm substantially more creeped out by the viewpoint that implies this situation is so frequent it needs to be addressed in the text, and the<em>fact</em>that there needs to be a patch rule to prevent incest, because the broader rules tell you it's a great idea.</blockquote>That's a whole lotta out-creepin' due to implication.  And implication about theoretical other players that you may or may not ever meet.  But hey, if you're bothered by the idea that somewhere, at some time, there's a bunch of people using Bliss Stage to role-play out incest scenarios, then... well... *I* certainly can't help you.<br/><br/>Then again, I can't really help anyone here since I've never played Bliss Stage.  I definitely want to, though.  And for me, I'd let my feelings and the feelings of my friends around the table determine whether stuff like incestuous Anchor/Pilot relationships are something that needs to be avoided moreso than the rules mechanics of the game...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/simjames" title="simjames"><img alt="simjames" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i41.tinypic.com/14kutg3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/simjames">simjames</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217141/#Comment_217141" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-08T03:52:20+00:00" title="July  8, 2009  3:52AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Ever play Wraith by White Wolf?
