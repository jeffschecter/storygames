When acting as an individual against an enemy, if the enemy had more dice there was almost no way to overcome the enemy and as one lost dice one at a time it was an inevitable death spiral.  The opposite issue happened when acting as a group against an enemy.  Does anyone know of any alternative dice rules that remedy this?  For example, does anyone know how well the Risusiverse dice rules work? Any info would be appreciated.

If he can't use one,  I don't think there's much more I can do for him. He seems to be advocating for bringing in more widespread traditional games and that's great but that's not what our group is about.

Besides the death spiral our session went well but I think that was a result of the GM doing a good job. I don't think our group will play it in the future being that everyone feels the same way. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_458787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/458787/#Comment_458787" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-12-21T19:43:19+00:00" title="December 21, 2016  7:43PM">December 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I re-read the rules I posted above, and I still think they could be a decent compromise between Risus and the Pool (would allow you to use Risus cliches, if that's something you like). <br/><br/>It would be fun, though, to have a "personal Pool", as well.

I also like how the Death Role is handled in The Pool.<br/><br/>P.S. <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> <br/>Paul, (as an aside) two questions:<br/>1. Are there any variants of The Pool that you are especially found of?<br/>2. If you were to try to make The Pool into a collaborative game, where all players contribute to the SIS in an equal way, how would you go about it? I would likely do it with by having the table go around clockwise; with each player taking the lead during their scene; choosing witch players are in the scene; and drawing a card that prompted some type of challenge or various other types of prompts to play out in the scene. I would probably add some dice roles that resulted in: fail, success with a cost or complication, or success. These dice rolled would only come into play when the stakes were ridiculously high (i.e. Combat?); I would have to think more about when dice rolls would be appropriate. I would probably standardize the "skills,"  perhaps have a list for players to choose from that would be effective in that particular genre or game. Anyway, I'm sure there's a way to do it more simply, but that might be an interesting set up. How would you do it?<br/><br/>If this conversation gets super involved we might create a new thread, but I don't think a quick detour is an issue.

I've designed a few games which do this (like my "Land of Nodd"), but it's a pretty major undertaking.<br/><br/>I imagine the simplest would be some kind of collaborative scene-setting procedure (a la Fiasco or Archipelago) and then using the die rolls instead of the "that might not be so easy..." phrase. If you get to play your character, but others can decide when you roll the dice, that would work pretty well for a GMless scenario.<br/><br/>You still need some kind of game procedure to produce consistent play; but a fictional scenario/setup and a group of creative players with the proper skills can sometimes substitute for that!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
