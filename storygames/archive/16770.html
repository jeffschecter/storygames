The game will eventually go the kickstarter route, but right now it is still in the alpha stage. Each section of Tropez will come with a number of ready-to-play, genre-specific tear sheets and a short adventure. The default fantasy setting is <b><i>Brood</i></b> and I'm looking for someone who is interested writing a cool, introductory adventure. Please let me know if you are interested and I can send you more details on the project. This, of course, would be a credited contribution. Thanks in advance!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
