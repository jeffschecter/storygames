One takes on the role of an Adventurer, the other is a Troll holed up under a bridge. Both roles, the playstyle, and the suggested cues, can be interpreted broadly. I wrote it to explore asymmetrical power balances - in particular those where one side has immediate power (Trolls, presumably, could handily deal with a lone Adventurer) and the other has the weight of society behind them - and see what kinds of negotiations emerge. The presentation is mostly an artifact of how I was taking notes that evening, but when I revisited the text to lay everything out I liked the feel.<br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1m8NLPWs1z1EgrjMvC1Os6u-iL_aGF-pAtgs0Zkrfuto/pub?w=1521&amp;h=1151" rel="nofollow">Adventurer &amp; Troll</a><br/><i>Feedback request</i>: any overhaul-level criticism, any tweaks to improve playability.<br/><br/>The second is a single-player alternate reality journaling game intended to be played in a moleskine or tumblr or youtube channel.

I wanted to write something that would have players actually creating things as part of the gameplay. Inspiration flowed heavily from one of the Doppelganger playbooks for MH. The baked-in story follows a plot but leaves freedom for interpretation, hopefully coming across as more of a dog run than a railroad.
