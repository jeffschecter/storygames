I am considering quitting the hobby (for now). My story is sad.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am 36 years old and started gaming 2 years ago. I moved to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (missionary doctor) which isn't exactly a well-known gaming community. I got 3-4 senior high schoolers from a local mission school into gaming last year with Savage Worlds but they graduated and left for the States. Some ~15 year old latched onto the hobby and I have tried to play with them. Hey, they're young but I was desperate to be gaming.  I was doing all the GMing until recently when they started running SW games and the last few sessions have SUCKED. The guys have recruited some more kids 11-16 years olds and all they want to do is play one ruleset, Savage Worlds, and do dungeon crawl-esque games but crawls that are remarkable only in that they are so incredibly repetitive and boring. They only like fantasy from growing up with the LotR films. I even met a 11yo that had never heard of Star Wars! (he is an MK, a "missionary kid" which can lead sheltered lives). They know Zelda too so the have alot of things popping up out of the ground in thier games. To mix it up I am looking at "Hollow Earth Expedition" but they don't know anything pulp other than Indiana Jones. I tried M&amp;M; and they don't like supers. I have thought about 3:16 but they don't know that genre either. I tried gaming with ADULTS from work but they were like,"eh". Something other than a SW horror-mystery might have been better.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently I found another gaming group in the city but they are all ~16yos and all they like is DnD 3.5. I'm going to run "Keep on the Shadowfell" for them so we will see how that works out. I can't let my other MK group play 4E (yet) as many of thier missionary parents think DnD is satanic. Savage Worlds is okay, DnD is bad. That's a topic for another day...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my real issue is that what I really like about gaming is the moral questions, problem solving, story, etc. especially as is reflected in the indie games of which I own many but don't play any. My groups want want to kill orcs not consider the <i>why</i> of killing orcs. They don't like any other genre other than fantasy and worst of all they cannot GM worth a flip. I don't want to GM all the time. I would write an AP report from todays adventure but it would just make you cry.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what do I want? I want to play with these guys but do something like SotC, DitV, etc. or a good, compelling story driven fantasy game. I am really considering a fantasy HEX game like "Desolation" that will encourage cinematic play and doesn't require dice. (Dice are unavailable here, even d6s)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are my ideas to possibly rescue my gaming life:<br/>\n1. Buy the guys a book about good GMing (while trying not to say "you all stink at this")<br/>\n2. Buy the guys SW modules that aren't boring.<br/>\n3. Try a GM-less indie game.<br/>\n4. Find an AWESOME indie game (?Agon)<br/>\n5. Virtual tabletops (but I only have unreliable dial-up)<br/>\n6. Move back to America (not a good option as my work here is more important than gaming)<br/>\n7. Bug my non-gaming wife to play a solo game (not going to happen)<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice?<br/>\nthanks,<br/>\nJon                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179748/#Comment_179748" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T09:19:22+00:00" title="November 22, 2008  9:19AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, part of the problem might be that you're playing with teenage boys, who are, on average, more interested in power fantasies than pathos. If the other players at the table seem to be enjoying the style of play more than you, then it's going to be hard to get all of them to change from a favored play style just to make you happy.<br><br>Do you have any inroads to non-gaming groups of people (of any age) interested in drama or storytelling? You could pitch them on the idea of playing a game as a storytelling method. Consider Primetime Adventures, which can be effectively GM-less and doesn't need dice.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179750/#Comment_179750" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T09:45:19+00:00" title="November 22, 2008  9:45AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Universalis is an easy sell as a high-brow party game amongst adults, if you want to try your luck with that crowd again. I'll say it's not going to work with your teenagers, but my experience gaming with teenagers (including myself as one, way back when that was true) is that they are pretty...focused, I guess. And not on anything that's likely to interest you.<br><br>On the upside, if they are having fun (without you, even) running Zelda-esque dungeon crawls with Savage Worlds, it sounds like they are well occupied and will probably spin off a small percentage of interesting (to you) gamers over time.<br><br>All missionary stuff takes time.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179751/#Comment_179751" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T09:50:51+00:00" title="November 22, 2008  9:50AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If they're enjoying what they're doing, let them enjoy it!
