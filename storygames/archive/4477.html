Hereto referred to as the Rev/eng contest.<br/><br/>So last year I ran this contest and it worked out pretty well (you can view the remains @   <a href="http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/reversed.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kevinallenjr.com/reverseengineer/reversed.html</a>). I had a good time envisioning the contest and running it. That was a year ago. <br/><br/>Now I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m in a bit of a quandary. I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t know if should run it again, and if I do, how. There are a lot of variables to consider. Sooooo I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m putting it out in the public forum to see what people think. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m not taking votes, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll be the final arbiter of wether or not I run the contest again, but I want to do something people are going to enjoy. Clearly I can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t please everyone, but I can certainly hear what people have to say.<br/><br/>So here's some questions to think about and respond to-<br/><br/>1. When would be a good time to hold this contest. Right now? November? Later in the year? Not again, thank you?<br/><br/>2. Would you like to retain the same format as last year. People make character sheets, then differant people make games.<br/><br/>3. Would you like to take last years format and twist it a little, but generally retain the same notion (find an interesting starting point for a game, develop material then switch designers). Keeping everything in the realm of "regular" rpg design.<br/><br/>4. Would you like to do something that is the same idea as above, but really (and i mean REALLY) push the bounds and get experimental with it? Perhaps by starting the design process in a very UN-rpg place.<br/><br/>let me know                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101317/#Comment_101317" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T13:09:41+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  1:09PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kevin, I really enjoyed the first rev/eng (and hope to be publishing my entry next year).  Doing it again, though... I dunno.<br/><br/>First off, if it went again I'd really want to see some change that would try to fix the "orphan sheets" phenomenon from last time.  We had a lot of character sheets created that did not get games written for them.  And that sucks.  To me, this is the biggest thing that needs to be 'fixed.'<br/><br/>Secondly, while I really liked the character sheet angle, perhaps we can do it from a different starting point this time?  Maybe the first round is submitting a die mechanic/character creation procedure/scene pacing structure, and then the second round is writing a game that uses it?<br/><br/>Stray thought: what if folks each submit one game-snippet (as in my "Secondly..."), and then everybody gets assigned three game-snippets that they put together to make a game?  That way, there's a much, much higher chance that most-or-all of the first round submissions make it into a game, since each submission goes to three participants for round two.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101318/#Comment_101318" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T13:11:27+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  1:11PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 5, 2007 1:12PM by Graham.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kevin, what are your thoughts?

Now, the character sheet could be seen as an end point in the design, but going a bit further, I get the idea of taking <em>actual play</em> as an end point to start reverse-engineering.<br/><br/>That is to say:  10 or so minutes of recorded audio listening in on some actual play that uses natural language.  Contestants listen to that and make the game they think they hear.<br/><br/>Maybe, just maybe, to address to orphan issue, you could do what others do and hand out a small number options, letting them pick one.  Since you want to keep the "People make character sheets, then different people make games." element, you could have volunteers submit material with the caveat that they can't choose their own, rather than dealing with contestants who drop the ball on the second part of the contest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_101321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101321/#Comment_101321" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-05T13:34:53+00:00" title="October  5, 2007  1:34PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with Ryan.

But I'm probably supposed make a suggestion to avoid it next time for that reason: <br/><br/>There should be some way to get the sheet you want. Better reduce the competition factor than being stuck with an ovary while other people are stuck with something you would have liked better.<br/>\n<blockquote>Secondly, while I really liked the character sheet angle, perhaps we can do it from a different starting point this time?

Some kind of end product. Just using a certain mechanic is like Game Chef. (Not that Game Chef is bad.) <br/><br/>So maybe a table of contents or an index? That would be less open then a character sheet.

In other words, it takes one methodology of game design and emphasizes it as the only or best way.  At least, the best way to design a game for this competition.

Since you want to keep the "People make character sheets, then different people make games." element, you could have volunteers submit material with the caveat that they can't choose their own, rather than dealing with contestants who drop the ball on the second part of the contest.</blockquote>\nAs to orphans, a number of ideas present themselves.  The most obvious would be to present the competition as independent stages, where the sheets get judged, in a First Stage contest, and then new contestants are invited into Stage Two.  Stage One entrants would be the first invites to Stage Two.  If the Stage One judging is a peer review, and leads to a partial winnowing of the field, the orphaning of sheets will feel fairer: the people who will be potentially using the sheets will be judging their awesomeness.<br/><br/>More subtle: allow contestants to edit the sheets they're presented with somewhat.  Suggest maybe that they're writing the second edition of the game, where the sheet comes from the first edition.

A biggest issue comes in doing something unusual -- like this contest -- and trying to make it suited for a more general audience.  To bring the point back home:  Kevin, what jazzes you when it comes to judging a contest about reverse engineering from character sheets?  Would that get lost in reverse engineering from another point?  Make sure you keep the contest something you're psyched about.  It's cool that you're looking for feedback, but don't lose your own personal awesome with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_101590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/101590/#Comment_101590" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-07T22:13:42+00:00" title="October  7, 2007 10:13PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 7, 2007 10:14PM by John_Harper.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As someone who missed out last time, I say do the same thing again.

The most obvious would be to present the competition as independent stages, where the sheets get judged, in a First Stage contest, and then new contestants are invited into Stage Two. Stage One entrants would be the first invites to Stage Two. If the Stage One judging is a peer review, and leads to a partial winnowing of the field, the orphaning of sheets will feel fairer: the people who will be potentially using the sheets will be judging their awesomeness.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like this idea a lot.  I did not participate in last year's contest because I felt that I would create a crappy character sheet or something that looked like a D20 sheet.  I wanted to participate and I'd still develop a game for an orphan if I had the chance, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102276/#Comment_102276" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T11:45:32+00:00" title="October 10, 2007 11:45AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looking over the character sheets from last year, I mentally broke them down into two camps: sheets designed for a game that would be cool and sheets designed to screw the designer.  "Ha! Let's see you make a game with this!" I dreaded the stage two part of the contest because I didn't want to get stuck with a sheet from the second camp. (Unfortunately, I ran into time constraints and didn't get to work with the sheet that was assigned to me from the first camp.)<br/><br/>Judson has a good point up there on dealing with the orphaned sheets.  Breaking the competition down into two stages, but at the end of stage one, we decide which sheet will be used in stage two.  Then in stage two, everyone uses that one sheet to create their game.

Or that could be a separate "Reverse Engineer D&amp;D" contest.  I think it would make a neat baseline to see how the designs differ.

Breaking the competition down into two stages, but at the end of stage one, we decide which sheet will be used in stage two.  Then in stage two, everyone uses that one sheet to create their game.  Three dozen participants? Three dozen games, all using the same character sheet.</blockquote>\nJust to be clear, I was thinking something like: everyone who participated in Stage One picks their favorite three sheets, possibly with a little openness in the process, so that we can see that a sheet we liked is getting no votes.  There's an award for the top 3, and then the bottom third (and especially any sheet with no votes) gets sent to the Character Sheet Orphanage, where it will eat gruel and hope that someone adopts it, even though it's getting so old that it's sure to be "redeemed."<br/><br/>Now, votes of Stage One folks act like PBeM Diplomacy choices, so that you are at least likely to get a sheet you picked as your top three, and more likely if you were the only one who liked it.  Stage Two folks can jump in at this point, with the possible wrinkle of being able to adopt out of the Orphanage.  (See, there is hope!)  There's a little overlap in some sheets, but probably the more popular ones get the most overlap, and it's clear that you'll be designing to the same sheet as someone else, so your game will have to Really Shine.<br/><br/>One judging rubric that I don't remember for sure whether it was in last Rev/Eng: Fidelity to Sheet.  Feel free to add blanks or ignore the Pulsating Brain on the sheet, but know that you'll get dinged for it.  But hey, you might make up in Creativity what you lose in Fidelity.<br/><br/><br/>I specifically liked that all the games last time were designed to different sheets, see, so I wouldn't want to push it all the way to one sheet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102316/#Comment_102316" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T13:48:29+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  1:48PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i think we are getting a lot of very good ideas here.

The trick is to match up a sheet with someone who is inspired to make a game from it.<br/><br/>Since this is a contest with points, I think we can use them a few different ways to balance it all out.<br/><br/>Method 1: Silent auction<br/><br/>Everyone gets 50 points.  Once the sheets are posted, designers can bid on the sheets (maybe on a web page?).  Unspent points translate into a bonus to your final score in the contest later *if* you submit a complete game.<br/><br/>(optional wrinkle:  everyone who spends 50 points on a sheet gets to design a game for that sheet, regardless of how many designers that means are designing a game for the same sheet.)<br/><br/>Method 2:  Countdown auction<br/><br/>Everyone gets 50 points.  Once the sheets are posted, a thread is opened.  First person to post claiming a sheet gets that sheet.  During the first 30 minutes, it costs 50 points to claim a sheet.  The next 30 minutes it costs 49 points, etc.  Anyone claiming a sheet after 25 hours gets that sheet for free (and 50 points added to their score if they submit a complete game).  (If we wanted 2 days instead of 25 hours, we could change the time period to every 60 minutes, say, or give people 100 points.)<br/><br/>Method 3:  Secret auction<br/><br/>Everyone gets 50 points.  You submit a list of sheets, and how much you would spend on each (you can leave as many blank as you wish).  Highest bidder for each sheet gets it, with ties broken by a) whoever submitted a sheet gets priority over someone who didn't;  b) whoever was outbid on more other sheets gets priority over someone who didn't get outbid as much; c) random draw (or they both get the sheet?  Worked OK for Jonathan's sheet last year, but it means possibly more orphans.)  In phase two, if you didn't get a sheet, and there are sheets left over, you bid on how many points you *want* for designing a sheet for it.  Ties are broken similarly, with lower bidders winning this time.<br/><br/>Optional wrinkle to the above three methods:  People who submit a sheet get 50 points, and people who do not submit a sheet (i.e. the rest of the world) get 25 points (giving submitters 'first dibs' on the sheets).<br/><br/>One advantage of all these methods is that they serve a dual function as votes for the sheets for the 'Most Inspirational' (highest price) and 'Most Intimidating' (lowest price)<br/><br/>Method 4:  Voting<br/><br/>Everyone submits an ordered list of 5 sheets they want to design a game for.  Sheets are distributed to designers similarly to the 'secret auction' method above.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>I'm sort of partial to the 'Countdown auction' method as it seems the least amount of work for the organizer.  But I'll volunteer to help count votes or sort out scores if people like one of the other methods better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102341/#Comment_102341" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-10T17:31:36+00:00" title="October 10, 2007  5:31PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the things I find I enjoy about these contests are seeing what others will make, given the same ingredients.

Another person made a game about being old men and stealing away the breath of others, inspired by the exact same three elements.

I just thought I'd provide another data point regarding what one might find awesome about a design contest.<br/><br/>Honestly, though, do you really need a design contest to push boundaries?

If you want to design something in your comfort zone you can--but the person that waits and picks a less-popular sheet gets a bonus from doing so.  You're therefore encouraged to leave your comfort zone by the structure of the auction.<br/><br/>And again, one person's comfort zone is another's impossibility.  That was half the problem with the orphaned sheets last year--the overhead was just too big a price to pay to actually produce a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102388/#Comment_102388" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-11T00:18:40+00:00" title="October 11, 2007 12:18AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: shreyas</cite>I really don't like this idea of writers choosing sheets.

The sheet ratings has Usability and Simplicity as rating categories.<br/><br/>It'd push people towards designing sheets that were useable, focused and easily handled.
