Not own their one -- I think still in conjunction with looking up an Oracle, mad-libs style.<br/><br/>For instance, say I'm looking at the Oracle of Blood &amp; Sex, and I draw the 9 of Spades.  Right now, it says "The deathbed curse of a betrayed queen."  But maybe instead it says "The deathbed curse of a  queen" or "The deathbed curse of a betrayed " or some other variation.  Then you draw another card to and look on the right part of that card to see what to fill in -- like maybe you draw the 3 of Hearts, and get either "Cowboy" or "Peaceful" (adjective of "Peace" on the card).<br/><br/>Does that make sense?  "The deathbed curse of a betrayed cowboy."  "The deathbed curse of a peaceful queen."  Maybe, maybe not.  I do think that adding more than one mad-lib element to an oracle entry may make it too chaotic.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm not saying the idea is perfect, but given that I have this neat little card set and am always looking for more ways to use it, I thought about this.  How might you use it?  If need by, change how my cards work.  Change that bottom bottle part from being dots to something else -- I know I will once this gets to revision and I know what that is.  Play around with it.<br/><br/>Here's hoping I'm not the only one to chime in on this idea. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_120462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/120462/#Comment_120462" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-18T15:05:30+00:00" title="January 18, 2008  3:05PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is interesting, Ryan. I think too mad-libby can be bad for an oracle, but it's definitely worth trying out. I'll grab my KT cards and see for myself!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
