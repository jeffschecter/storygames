I think it's something that's heavily at play in most non-abstract games (that is, any game where the elements involved in play can reasonably be said to correspond to objects or concepts that exist outside of the game), and a huge part of how roleplaying games produce meaning.<br/><br/>The procedures we follow when playing games make claims about all sorts of things: about how much it hurts to get shot in the leg, about what you can expect from being more or less attractive than average, about the benefits of fostering positive relationships with other people, about how characters' flaws shape the stories they participate in, about when uncertainty serves to create dramatic tension, etc...<br/><br/>So the way that overall meaning in games is constructed is through an arrangement of statements like, "These things are like this," and "Doing this produces this result," "A corresponds to B in these ways," and such. There's still a necessary level of subjective interpretation that needs to be done on the final arrangement of those statements, and different kinds of procedures can be more or less geared towards being easily interpreted.<br/><br/>But just like words themselves generally mean very little on their own, constructing significant amounts of meaning often requires stringing lots of these procedures together, and what they ultimately mean is highly dependent on which ones are present and how they relate to each other. Like, the rules for alignment don't really mean all that much when they're just sitting in the rulebook (though they do, I think, make strong suggestions about what they might be used to mean, particularly when we take a holistic look at their appearance in the rules), compared to when (and why and on whom) the Paladin actually uses Smite Evil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475782/#Comment_475782" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-27T14:02:58+00:00" title="July 27, 2018  2:02PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really understand the question - are you really just asking about how a game carries meaning?<br/><br/>If so, I like the way Yukamichi breaks it down - roleplaying games carry narrative messages, but they also carry meaning in their structures, so it's in a sense a wider and more varied medium than storytelling.<br/><br/>As for how we can perceive that meaning - how is it possible to tell what a game is about - I'd say that it's no different from the way we evaluate e.g. novels: you just have to experience the thing, understand it and then verbalize that understanding. As we know from general art theory, the work in itself is not about anything per se, but it is possible for it to be pretty consistent about producing a similar understanding for many different people; this understanding is what we usually mean when we say that something is "about" something else. The meaning is not inherent to the pattern, but neither is it independent; you need both the work and the audience to have the meaning emerge in the audience's understanding of the work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475787/#Comment_475787" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-28T00:45:18+00:00" title="July 28, 2018 12:45AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your replies, but you're both dodging the question, which is maybe understandable?  <br/><br/>I get that rpgs have little things that when combined hopefully create meaning past their content.  Like, they become contextualized through play, but not really all that often.  I mean, who are we kidding, right?  I mean, yes, I've at times, been emotionally moved by playing a game, but the game part is not that involved in it.  I mean, it's a character sheet, most of the time, blankly staring back at me.  It's not that involved, the game part.  The people around the table, perhaps, and hopefully moreso.  <br/>The buy-in is super involved.  The game...eh it's there, doing what games do... mostly.<br/><br/>I think with the somewhat better games, you can kinda answer this.  Like, Paranoia.  <br/>But I think Paranoia, is kinda in the minority.  <br/><br/>I'm not asking about content, I'm asking about context.  Again, I understand that something like rules, lead to a form of context, like "if-that-than-this" type of thing.  <br/>We hopefully use rules to create context, but I'm just saying that I don't see it happen all that much.  The context surely isn't very clear.  I mean, it's why when you ask someone what the D&amp;D game was about last week, they just describe what happened, not "what it was about", the theme.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475788">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475788/#Comment_475788" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-28T01:52:29+00:00" title="July 28, 2018  1:52AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think I understand what you mean. Could you give us an example of what some game is about in your mind, or how a given game is clearly not about anything? I understand your initial example about the fairy tale <i>Red Riding Hood</i>, and how you can verbalize its theme, but I don't see how that can be compared to games.<br/><br/>Maybe you've just been encountering remarkably meaningless play recently? I certainly have seen a lot of that over time, but not nearly enough as to conclude that it's a property of the rpg form.<br/><br/>Our D&amp;D session last Monday was about five things:<br/><b>*</b> Getting to know the <i>Chronicles of Prydain</i> and its background in Celtic folklore. This is a long-term process, it didn't happen all at once during that one session.<br/><b>*</b>Learning 4th edition D&amp;D; most of the group don't have prior experience, so everything from skill challenges to magic item purchasing came as more or less welcome revelations.<br/><b>*</b> Trying out our assortment of techniques for playing an engaging action scene with miniatures and battlemap. This was the first real combat scene in the campaign so far, so there was a lot of "about" in there: seeing how the numbers unfolded into action was quite entertaining.<br/><b>*</b> Learning to play together, with this specific game. Not only are some players new to me, but everybody also needs to find their place in a game that has a structure unlike those we've played in the past. All kinds of interactions starting with basics like "what am I allowed to say and when" are new, and therefore doing even simple things successfully is exciting.<br/><b>*</b> An evil trapper driven insane by grief gave the heroes a hard time on the battlefield, which became the meat of the session. This had thematic connotations in terms of storytelling, but mostly we were amused by the effectiveness with which a dense forest and a tricky trap-maker combined to give a seemingly harmless old man a pretty respectable danger level. The tactical high point of the combat was when one of the heroes climbed out of a pit trap (with spikes, of course) only to position himself in such a manner that the trapper, suddenly appearing from the brush, could simply <i>push him back in</i> for another round of trap damage.<br/><br/>That pretty much covers it. I don't think that this session was in any way exceptional - we're always doing stuff at the game table and the play is always "about" something. Very often it is an "about" that is directly derived from some game text or other. It's really not hard, if you want to name a game text I can tell you what it's about.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" rel="nofollow">Nathan_H</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>How does... Apocalypse World show this?  </p></div></blockquote>\nIt shows it in play, ultimately. Game texts do not traditionally include a careful exegesis of what they mean in the game text itself. Rather, you're expected to study the text to learn how to execute the ritual, and then you do the ritual, and at the end you have had an experience that you can assign meaning to.<br/><br/>In the case of <i>Apocalypse World</i> I would expect the experience of play to often involve stories that include themes like questioning the value of the modern world, emphasizing universal qualities of human existence in a post-apocalyptic world, showing what kind of world people might make given the chance...<br/><br/>Finally: what do you think of Ron Edwards's theory of Narrativism (the idea about story games not having themes, but rather Premises that only become themes through play), and does that pertain at all to what you're asking about? Does it answer the question?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475791/#Comment_475791" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-28T07:58:19+00:00" title="July 28, 2018  7:58AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 28, 2018 7:59AM by Paul_T.">edited July 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there are two ways a game can be "about" something, in the literary sense you're using to analyze <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>.<br/><br/>The first way is just like a story:<br/><br/>You sit down and you play through the game, creating a story. That story may have themes, subjects, morals, and so forth, just like any story. <br/><br/>You might say, "We played <i>Archipelago</i> last night. My character was a young woman, who tried to escape from a wolf. Clearly, the wolf was a metaphor for a predatory man."<br/><br/>The second way is via fictional content, fictional and procedural constraints, and play procedures.<br/><br/>The game might be said to make statements about the people playing, the way they engage with roleplaying and with each other, and the fictional material.<br/><br/>For instance, if I write a game where the only way to win is to lie to your friends, we could say that my game is, at some level, "about" lying, uncovering lies, or something similar. (Given a specific game, we can talk about this in some more detail; in the abstract it sounds very vague, but with an actual game we can get to a more specific formulation.)<br/><br/>The relationship of the way the game tells the participants to interact with each other and the rules for what happens in the fiction all limit the scope of stories which may be told, and that implies (or even forces) themes to emerge.<br/><br/>For instance, in D&amp;D, stories which recreate aspects of the Hero's Journey are part of the fabric of the design. If you wanted to tell stories about hubris and how the once mighty all fall, with the characters being aging heroes fighting a hopeless battle as their skills and abilities degrade... you wouldn't be able to do that without redesigning the game.<br/><br/>As another <i>Monsterhearts</i> gives the characters a limited palette of abusive, manipulative, or coercive ways to gain and exert influence over each other. In this sense, it's often said to be "about" dysfunctional relationships. However, it also tells us to create teenage characters with monstrous aspects which exaggerate young peoples' feelings of alienation, angst, anger, and similar "teenage" problems. The MC is instructed to make "all acceptance conditional"; between these various design elements you end up with a game which is clearly about teenagers struggling with their identity and treating each in dysfunctional ways. The game is "about" the high school experience, told through a metaphor of monsters and body horror.<br/><br/>Many of the specifics (especially the "sex moves") make strong statements about the nature of sex and teen relationships, much in the same way as <i>Little Riding Hood</i>. For instance, the Mortal's sex move tells us that, at least for this character, consummating love is a self-destructive thing and the person you trust will inevitably turn into a monster (and probably hurt you).<br/><br/>However, the game also shows us an inevitable avenue for hope: play long enough, and the PCs will gain "growing up moves", which allow them to create functional relationships for the first time. There's a strong and clear theme in there, as well. <br/><br/>All these things constrain the kinds of stories we can tell. When the rules and procedures constrain the fiction sufficiently to create stories which reliably produce these themes, we can say that a game is "about" those themes, much like <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475801/#Comment_475801" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-29T17:04:25+00:00" title="July 29, 2018  5:04PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I don't see that premise-becoming-theme thing happen all that much in play, and I've played some great games, with some great game players.  I mean, I've had hints of slivers of theme, but nothing like story is capable of.  <br/>I mean, games can barely tell jokes, which are really simple stories.<br/>I guess, I agree with Ron that games, including of the rpg variety, don't have themes, in the literary sense.<br/>But, I kinda think Paranoia does?  <br/>I don't think D&amp;D has one,  beyond a sort of subconscious greed.  D&amp;D would probably be better with a clearer Press-Your-Luck mechanism.  If it clarified the whole risk/reward thing.  I'm sure those mini-dungeon-themed dice/card games do something like that?<br/><br/>Paul, <br/><br/>Your first way, I have never played that way.  The theme in hindsight way.  I imagine it exists through some sort of Jungian examination, but I think it's a rare beast.<br/><br/>Lying in games, isn't like lying in lies(stories).  I've played in games where lying is rewarded, and the premise, isn't usually about lying, but the context for those lies.<br/><br/>I don't think D&amp;D comes anywhere close to the Hero's Journey.  It's got a rise to power and complexity, that hopefully follows a players learning curve.  That's about it.  I don't even think it addresses the necessary lack of, that you'd need as contrast, if it were a story.  Like if D&amp;D is really about the a rise in power, you'd think it would focus a bit more on the making do without, or the struggle.  But struggle in game is a tightrope walk.<br/><br/>In Monsterhearts, how long does it take for these "growing-up" moves to come into play, because they seem like something that would approach theme.  That revisiting of oneself, with a different perspective.<br/>I'm 43, I've not wanted to revisit my teenage years, so I've steered clear of Monsterhearts.    <br/><br/>I think the closest role-playing games can get to story is facts, or perhaps history.  It's because games abstract the human experience, with a greater degree of removal, than facts or story do.<br/><br/>I think the game Hide &amp; Seek has a proto-theme.  I think it's an almost perfect game.   Maybe because it's not throwing a whole lot of story at you?  I have no clue why Hide &amp; Seek works.  I mean, yes it plays into fear, and it's not asking for us to behave in a nuanced way, just fearful and/or sneaky.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475803/#Comment_475803" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-29T18:35:06+00:00" title="July 29, 2018  6:35PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 29, 2018 6:38PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited July 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So we're interested in theme specifically, and how games don't have a literary theme? There's other sorts of about-ness in the world as well, but that does narrow it down a lot.<br/><br/>I pretty much agree on that point - games are about many things, and different games are different, but a literary theme is not even the most common thing for a game to be about. Taken as a whole over the entire field of rpgs one could say that roleplaying games don't have a theme, any more than football does.<br/><br/>There are a whole bunch of games that indeed have a "proto-theme", a premise that the game invites the players to explore. If that doesn't turn into a theme, the fault could be in the game, or it could be in the players - I have certainly seen people play games about some blindingly obvious topics, and failing to produce a story that has a theme. <i>Zombie Cinema</i>, for instance: as wacky as it seems, about 10% of the people who try it seem to be able to play it through without noticing that the game invites them to depict and judge human morality in a crisis situation. For those players Zombie Cinema can truly be said to be about nothing at all, as there really isn't much left of it once you discard that basic premise. A bit of dice rolling and menacing growls, that's it.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there are even games that do have a literary theme baked in, precisely as much of a one as a fairy tale does. <i>Paranoia</i> was already mentioned, it doesn't exactly shy away from its literary theming. <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> is another example. <i>Exalted</i> counts as well, and so does <i>Pendragon</i>. <i>Dread</i>, <i>Dead of Night</i>, <i>Puppetland</i>, most superhero games... Any games that have their own in-built story that comes up strongly in play count in this regard, I think. <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> is one of those games that might count or not: its story is in most editions indubitably one-note and very clear, but it is also very realistic to play it while ignoring that story, so any given play-through may be narratively independent (telling about something else) or narratively meaningless.<br/><br/>But those exceptions aside, yeah - lots of games out there that don't have a literary theme, or that theme is very secondary to what goes on in the game. <i>Apocalypse World</i> definitely included - it's a carefully constructed narrativist game; those aren't supposed to push their own themes.<br/><br/>Also, my own experience about that premise-turning-into-theme thing: while you say that it's rare and barely perceptible, my experience is that I'll get it over 90% of the time when playing a game designed for it. The afore-mentioned Zombie Cinema, for instance: give me good players and it's gonna be 100% of the time, until we grow bored of doing it. I don't know if our difference on this is because of different play experiences or a difference in how we interpret theme out of a story - could be that you require the theme to be presented very explicitly before you acknowledge its presence in a story?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475804/#Comment_475804" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-29T19:39:56+00:00" title="July 29, 2018  7:39PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think any RPG is "about" the feedback its system provides, most so on the largest scale at which that happens.<br/><br/>Call of Cthulhu is about how seeking and seeing supernatural horror leads to madness or death.

I'm not saying people can't like, or shouldn't like what I might consider bad stories, I'm just saying that role-playing games, for the most part, lack theme.

I'm joking about the wasted hours, but not about the feeling of personal betterment.  For it to be about personal betterment, you've got to show failed attempts, and D&amp;D just gives gifts through grinding.  It's not like Power Stunts in Marvel Super Heroes.

Some, but certainly not all, LARPs are often more "scripted" or "controlled" than many other sorts of games, which could open up more opportunity to hammer home a theme than games that are more open-ended.<br/><br/>That being said, I personally think that that openness is to at least some extent an illusion, no matter how much people try to tout it as a major feature of roleplaying games, and I also think that there's more theme going on in games than you're trying to argue in this thread, but I don't really know how to convince you of that, or if it's even something worth attempting. <br/><br/>I think that a lot of games at least strive for themes, even if they are usually vague about what those themes are, and a lot of times, particularly with "story games," people's sense of having "played the game wrong" can at least in part be an acknowledged failure to use the tools the game provides to manifest those themes through play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
