I want to talk about it a bunch.  But that's later.  I'm posting this right now because I feel like an asshole over something.  <br/><br/>Someone came up to me just after the discussion rapped and asked me about my game, Criminal Element.  He was really enthused and asked me for the website and stuff.  I gave it to him, then I was interrupted by a friend that needed to tell me something.  I turned back around and the guy I was talking to was gone.  <br/><br/>Hey, guy!  If you read this, please whisper to me!  I want to talk to you, ask you a couple of questions, and get the chance to actually introduce myself.  I want to make up for the fact that I was pulled away mid-conversation.  <br/><br/>-m                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
