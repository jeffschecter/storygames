Zendo looks really neat, though, and that's a great idea to do both and compare/contrast. Thanks a bunch!<br/>\n<br/>\nI just can't help but think there's a short jump from these kinds of games to something like the Clue board game, and then from there it's a short jump to some kind of story-game. Something like a mystery game or a conspiracy/spy game feels like a natural outcome from these structures.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs joepub mentioned, something with paradoxes/time travel. I get the hint of an idea for something like a Laddergram puzzle. Players start with two Premises, the beginning and the end. They have to use "time travel" to explain how they get transform history to change from one to the other in 5 time-journeys. Maybe add a competing team trying their own version and/or to sabotage the others journey?

Figuring out who did it is dead simple. Constructing the proof, in such a way that his lawyer can't find any loopholes, is the hard part. And so rather than "finding the answer", you are "proving the answer". So, a detective who knows that it was some mafia member (stinky pete), but needs to find bulletproof evidence to present to the jury.<br/><br/>A very different idea: rather than finding a game that "requires" a particular logic, find a game that "operates" under a particular logic. I'm imagining something along the lines of Alice in Wonderland... your students stumble into a bizarre fantasy world, with interesting characters, grandiose set pieces, and some dangerous threats. It all seems like total chaos at first, and if they're going to escape alive, they need to learn the internal logic of the world (speak to royalty in iambic pentameter; crows ignore negative modifiers like "not"; you can only reach the forbidden forest through the murky meadow; etc).<br/><br/>That idea also works perfectly with a game that's set in an alien world. SIGN IN STRANGER!!!!!!!! That game is about learning an alien logic in order to integrate &amp; live on an alien world.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250188/#Comment_250188" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-09T18:19:02+00:00" title="January  9, 2010  6:19PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was a cool adventure game for the Apple 2 called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Odyssey" rel="nofollow">Robot Odyssey</a> that was solved by the manipulation of digital logic gates.

My reason for this is that task resolution partly revolves around justifying why the particular attributes you have are relevant to the current situation. <br/><br/>Really though, I rather agree with Joepub in that RPGs are not built to encourage logic as resolution. You may find it more fruitful instead to use whatever simple system you have, and design a story or adventure that relies on logic to solve.<br/><br/>That, or you could simply invent a new system.

The setup was an impending invasion from the Astral Plane. The Githyanki were about to unleash massive devastation and there really was nothing the PCs could do to stop it. However, in a sort of send up to the oddity that was D&amp;D the seeds of victory lie in the inexplicable alliance of Red Dragons and the Githyanki. In my world, Dragons were amazing powerful noble creatures, why should they serve the Githyanki who despite their creepy appearance were basically just people?<br/>So I came up with the amusing little fable. Tiamat, the mother of all Dragons, was lured into a riddle contest with the Githyanki. Because the Dragon lost, her most precious children had to serve the Githyanki. Fairly lame, but it served the point. All the PCs had to do was solve the riddle and free the dragons, for the Githyanki to lose a powerful ally, and gain a vengeful enemy. <br/>So I wrote up a riddle. It was fairly complex (if I can dig it up I will post it). <br/><br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>So, you are asking yourself, how could these PCs solve a riddle that not even the noble Dragons could in thousands of years?<br/>That was sort of the point. The Riddle was not solvable, at least not on the most reasonable translation into Logic. <br/>My more logically minded players (two philosophy majors, and two computer guys) worked hard to translate the English into Sentence Logic, and then solve for the solution. The other players, a Lit Major, an English Major and a story writer (later an Epidemiologist) bored quickly of the all the symbology and started working through the story issues. They figured out that smarts were not going to be enough. And they started on the "real" solution. <br/>The Riddle basically said that four creatures met and agreed to perform certain tasks. (It was more complex than that, but the main idea was there). The four returned and the riddle said that three of them completed the task, the remaining one implied it, but said instead that the fourth (the Dragon) claimed to have completed his task. Eventually, and nearly simultaneously the two groups came to the conclusion that the Dragon, in the riddle, lied about completing the mission. <br/>The reason the Dragons could not solve the riddle wasn't that it was actually unsolvable. Merely that the solution required considered that a Dragon would FAIL at some task and the LIE about it. The idea was beyond their comprehension. <br/>The fun part was that they couldn't just go tell the Dragons this. (A) The Dragons are proud creatures and would not want Humans helping them, (B) The dragons still wouldn't get it. <br/>PC: "The Dragon Lied" <br/>Dragon: "I don't understand"<br/>PC: "You know what lying is?"<br/>Dragon: "Sure"<br/>PC: "And you know what a Dragon is."<br/>Dragon: "Obviously."<br/>PC: "So.. put them together, the Dragon lied."<br/>Dragon: "I don't get it."<br/><br/>They eventually figured out a way to do it. It was a good long adventure, but perfectly suited to the scale and kind of game. It did use logic, but it wasn't about solving the riddle. At least, not just about solving the riddle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250255/#Comment_250255" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-10T20:30:21+00:00" title="January 10, 2010  8:30PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Danny,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ozbot</cite>Something like a mystery game or a conspiracy/spy game feels like a natural outcome from these structures.</blockquote>\nHave you seen Mutant City Blues?

I mean, you could simplify any conclusion to be specific-- defeat the villain, rescue the princess, etc. I suppose in some ways you have to work 'backward' when considering logic as any kind of storytelling mechanic, in that it's easier to consider the linear process that *led* to the conclusion rather than feel railroaded into a conclusion because you must follow the step by step process. This in an of itself leads to an interesting TOK question-- can you have a satisfying story purely based on logical principles of reasoning, or is it more satisfying based on emotion/intuition? The suits in Hollywood keep trying the former, and the fans always seem to prove the latter.<br/>\n<br/>\nSol, your game sounds amazing, and those players sounds like they are both intimidating and a lot of fun to play with.<br/>\nPaul, I like the suggestion of Mutant City Blues, and I'll have to check it out to see if there's some ways to adapt to my classroom. Serial Homicide Unit sounds a little more ... intense, on the face of it. Is that a game as well? What are its selling point in terms of logic?<br/>\n<br/>\nJoe and I are totally on the same page, though. I already thought of the "working backwards" to prove the mystery thing, but it's pretty close to a Mock Trial unit I do with my students in a different semester. The Wonderland thing was another thing that came to my mind when I considered that I might have to write up a game to suit my own purposes. I was also thinking of some player-generated element, mad-lib style or using word cards, so that players would have to self-impose their own premises. "All NOUNS are BLANK" being on a character sheet, and players have to act out that premise at some point along the journey. Obviously, it might get quite silly and "illogical" and thus the Wonderland kind of idea. (This is kind of forcing logic terminology into Ash's idea of somethign pretty straightforward and FATE like.)  The alien world might be a good idea, too.

The Mastermind one worked beautifully-- I first showed an example with the video projector of an online version, then had students use prepared handouts to pair up and try it out on each other (one being Mastermind, the other being the 'code-breaker.') About halfway through, I explained to them how to "beat" the game using deductive logic, and it was great to see their minds click into the clue. The rest of the period they experimented with the game and tried to find what made things 'easy' or 'hard.'<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next time we met I tried the Zendo version. This failed miserably. It wasn't the game per se, but the problem was giving students things to build with. They weren't concerned at all with trying to get "Buddha nature" or not (although that terminology was a big hit), and instead they just wanted to build things over and over. Some of the problems were in trying to get a large number of students involved (you really do have to watch if the other players get Buddha nature or not) and the fact that the "Master" had drawn somewhat difficult koans to begin with. Overall, I do think they got the idea of inductive logic versus deductive logic, so at least there's that. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, I've also come up with the bare bones of a mystery-logic story game I've called Master Thief. The idea is that one player is the Master Thief. He chooses a Quirk that will determine the basis for all his crimes/a rule that will dictate what he can steal and what he can't. All other players must be the Investigators. Each investigator can choose a specialty/an area of expertise that can allow him to ask additional questions when trying to guess the Thief's pattern. Investigators take turns offering up items they think the Thief would steal, asking each other questions about them, and watching/guessing what the Thief will steal. If an Investigator correctly anticipates what a Thief will steal and correctly guesses the Quirk behind it, the Investigators win! If the Thief gets away with 4 items, the Thief wins!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone is interested to see more, I'd love to have some input on it. For example, I'm wondering if I keep it pretty freeform or if it would be better to have cards that players draw. I know it's too late for Game Chef etc., but maybe we can start a thread or a private conversation or something.

As much as I love Looney labs, you don't have to drop $50 for five Treehouse sets to be able to play Zendo.<br/><br/>3) Check out my variant called Ikkozendo:<br/><a href="http://www.icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=Ikkozendo" rel="nofollow">http://www.icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=Ikkozendo</a><br/>It is best for when you have a limited number of components (e.g. a single Treehouse set). It also only has the Master making changes, and there's a guess every turn, so it removes the fiddling with new koans by Students and the whole Master/Mondo elements (this is a plus and a minus, in my opinion).<br/><br/>4) The quickest way to make a hard koan is with noise, NOT with a lot of adjectives or conjunctions, believe it or not. If a koan has the Buddha Nature AND it also has umtpy-thousand other possible relationships or BNs, then there's a LOT of branches of the binary tree to chop down before one can find the correct one. And what's worse, new Students will try to make their own koans as complex as the Master's, thinking the noise is signal... and as such marking their koans as BN or !BN doesn't tell them a lot. The BEST early Student koans are those with one pyramid/Lego/whatever!<br/><br/>I consider Zendo one of the coolest games out there, using Icehouse pyramids--never has a game so consistently captured folks of all ages, backgrounds, and gamer-experience levels!<br/>-----<br/>Another great Looney labs games that you can (basically) play for free is <i><a href="http://www.wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/Werewolf/Rules.html" rel="nofollow">Are You A Werewolf?</a></i> (AKA <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~mafia/oldmafia/rules.htm" rel="nofollow">Mafia</a>).<br/>Or:<br/><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamecategory/1039/deduction" rel="nofollow">Board Game Geek deduction category</a><br/>Or:<br/><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamecategory/1028/puzzle" rel="nofollow">Baord Game Geek puzzle category</a><br/><br/>(Note that Zendo appears in both of those categories!)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_251467">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251467/#Comment_251467" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-19T16:38:55+00:00" title="January 19, 2010  4:38PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For an RPG-like game, the first thing that comes to my mind is to use the classic logic puzzles involving people who always tell the truth or always lie.

Each corresponds to one of 4 elements, and one of 3 astral bodies.  Each spell is composed of 4 runes in 4 positions, which are  w.r.t.  on  while .  If you can figure out which runes are in a spell, you can alter the spell's effects, or turn it on or off.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have 6 types diagnostic tools that tell you different things about the elements and bodies in the spell -- which are most prevalent, which surround which, which appear multiple times in a row, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there's the basic logic puzzle of the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn top of that, there's some resource management; basically, an incentive to get it right using the fewest diagnoses possible.  (Employing these tools consumes them, so the finite supply must be managed carefully -- spend too many on one spell, and you won't have enough for the next spell.  Additionally, attempting alterations to the spell consumes an even more previous resource.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis system is easy to slap adventure story color onto.  Activate the heat protection amulet so you can cross the room of fire, turn off the cursed sword so you can wield it without getting life-drained, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore ambitiously, instead of telling them the whole system up front, you can introduce them to it bit by bit during an adventure.  (Here's some runes... now here's some dust that talks when you pour it on runes... now here's a stone tablet listing elements and astral bodies...)<br/>\n<br/>\nI can send you the list of runes and the list of diagnostic info types if you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nPs,<br/>\n-David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ozbot" title="ozbot"><img alt="ozbot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/nCTCPKSKDL4Z7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ozbot">ozbot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252407/#Comment_252407" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-24T18:46:15+00:00" title="January 24, 2010  6:46PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 24, 2010 6:57PM by ozbot.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, David!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat list is great. We were only able to go through three rounds, and looking at the list, we only used "level" 1 and 2. Still, I think the students had no idea of what to expect. If I were to do this again, I think I would give them some idea of the types of Buddha natures available in the first place, such as reading through the different rule cards before we started. To have them figure out such parameters is more in line of the logic I was trying to teach, but we simply don't have enough class time and the jump start would have been nice. Also, the Mastermind thing worked nicer since they could try to split up into partners. The groups I had them in were too big-- good to give instructions to but hard to wait for each player to go through their phases.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe used rectangular pieces of wood of various sizes/color that the elementary teachers use with math lessons. Also, your Ikkozendo was what we were on our way to playing as the day went on and I had to adjust rules on the fly. I personally think that would match well with the demands of doing this game in a classroom.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm quite familiar with Mafia, and we regularly play that in my 'regular' classes too, especially if I teach The Crucible.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: Also-- yeah, I'd love to see the rules for the rune/spell game! That sounds exactly like what I was looking for originally! What did you think about my Master Thief idea?
