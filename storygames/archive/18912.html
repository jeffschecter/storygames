A rules set is only a snapshot, an instance of a developing methodology/gaming culture. It's an instance of system.\n<blockquote>Example 1: Dave Arneson and Gary Gygax, just after playing the first game of what-was-to-become-D&amp;D together. From "Playing at the world":<br/><br/><i>Gygax was hooked, and quite naturally the first thing he requested was the rules.<br/><br/>Arneson recorded his reaction as: "Rules? What rules!??!" (\u2026) Arneson accumulated rulings from day to day without constructing any coherent overarching system.</i></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Example 2: Jonathan Tweet, running Over the Edge, making tons of shit up about Al Amarja, and then deciding to write it down and make it canon.</blockquote>\nI like the thought of designing the attitude, the principles - just like Vincent did in AW (and Emily and I did in Play With Intent).

Approach and attitude are instead ways of thinking. Was that what you meant with the first example? That instead of having rule sets (like oD&amp;D), you have approaches to create rules of your own (like Arneson did)? So a roleplaying game can teach you in how to produce your own system to approach a specific genre or play style?<br/><br/>But honestly, to do that, don't you need some basic game mechanics? Like how I created <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/421481#Comment_421481" rel="nofollow" target="_new">mantras</a> to form my way of thinking in how to use the game mechanics in action games.

They're in a good mood, and know each other well, including their tastes in literature &amp; what sort of fun the other likes. They decide to write down the process they used for improvisation. <br/><br/>Charlotte and Diane read the process and try out the same thing. It sort of works, but their tastes are different. (So far, this is all old hat; we've discussed these things before).<br/><br/>A few days later, Ann and Bert pick up their own rules and play by them. <i>They don't have the same amount of fun as last time at all. </i> They're in a different mood, and need a different sort of game. If they'd just improvised their story <i>and their process</i>, which they did the first time, they would end up with something - a system and a shared fiction - that was very different from last time, but satisfied them in a different way, more fitting to the situation, context and mood of the moment.</blockquote>\nThat last part is what I'm after, what I want. I want that mutability, that higher level of abstraction that can help me improvise the game I want for that specific situation.

It would be somewhere between Graham Walmsley's <i>Play unsafe</i> and, I dunno, a themed party planning book/cookbook, but for games.<br/><br/>I find the idea pretty cool myself. I know a lot folks have kinda poked at the concept already, myself included.<br/><br/>Right off, I notice two things:<br/><br/>First, as you've described above, there's a case for why a game built on the fly ( but with knowledge of various tools/attitudes) is a great, unique experience. You'll need to make that case though.<br/><br/>Second, I think you'd need to discuss planning-ahead a bit, and choosing among the toolkit when planning a specific sort of game, and why those tools chosen for it matter.<br/><br/>I wouldn't know quite the way to approach it. I've gotten advice in the past that a text should accentuate the positive and not make negative comparisons of other system approaches. At some point though, you will have to compare and contrast the approach you're talking about to existing, known approaches, and that's when people are likely to take offense.<br/><br/>Notably, you're taking what could be construed as a terribly anti-commercial stance with this: If anyone can, with a bit of understanding of those tools make their own satisfying game on the fly, then presumably they don't actually <i>need</i> to buy anything else.<br/><br/><i>Want</i> to buy something else is naturally still an option.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423051/#Comment_423051" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-17T08:20:30+00:00" title="October 17, 2013  8:20AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a player or GM, I do like to have a clear idea of what I'm supposed to do to start having fun in X way (where X is the approximate atmosphere the author of the game intended to achieve in play) Then I can improvise on my own. Your idea looks like "here's this book to show you how to start having fun making a game on the fly" and that as a concept looks amazingly fun. But then again, I'll need you to show me a proper clear procedure to start making a provoking game.<br/><br/>As a designer, this looks perfectly doable, you know? after all, almost all "generic systems" try to go this way more or less. And we have an amazingly wide arrange of tools to apply to games to obtain different atmospheres, I'd say put there options of different tools for players to use (after all, not everyone will be familiar with all or even enough of them) but make the basic procedure about how to make something fun, challenging and how to go ahead and risk trying it just for the fun of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423061/#Comment_423061" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-17T11:34:24+00:00" title="October 17, 2013 11:34AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One reason behind having set rules is to lay down the procedures that can allow someone else to have the same (or a comparable) play experience. <br/><br/>This is very hard to do. As I've found, even very clearly written games like Dungeon World can be interpreted in different ways. So the way I run it (using the same principles and moves) is different from others - or so I've been told. The game works either way. <br/><br/>Being able to spread an experience to a larger audience than those with me is why I write rules.

And it's easy to think it's simple when you've done it at least once. It's comparable in some degree to your first date; ain't no rocket-vodoo when you learn to ask, care and<i> then</i> go with your insticts, instead of the other way around. <br/><br/>The amount of small simple things we learn when doing something like these is unbelievable, and doesn't feel complicated only because we're using several different approaches of problem solving at once. Okay, most of these are things we have done before at one point of our lives, but coordinating them into a whole new activity can proof to be a daunting task when we don't have a proper precedure to start with it or when don't see how other people do it.<br/><br/>Among a lot of things you've got to learn to play the game:<br/>-The piece of printed paper before you is supposed to help you represent a character in your mind, and help as a legal defense against questioning from the GM &amp; the group about the extent and nature of the actions it will take, according to your decisions. (five minutes watching how other people read their character sheet before doing something or pointing something there for the GM to see are usually enough to realize this)<br/><br/>-All people on the table are sharing the same fictional space. Interesting things happen there. Because you made a choice and rolled the dice. The impact this piece of knowledge has on the human mind is big enough to have the players coming back to repeat the same experience. If it results uncomfortable because of the game, gm or the group, if you fail to realize it or never learn to enjoy it, you probably won't play a tabletop rpg again. Each person on the table that gets the idea and gives an ingame feedback of their own possibly duplicates the chances of the rest of the group to understand the concept; each person that stops trying to get it and gives out of ga<br/><br/>-Yes, you can do anything with your character in the fiction, but not everything you do will make everyone happy at the table, and you either find out what will do or learn to enjoy the game without taking in consideration the reaction of the rest of the players. (Some players of my group still show this attitude despite the time we've been playing. They have fun by ruining others fun; strangely the answer from the rest of the players is to cope with it and wait until the fictional universe or the dice choose to encarnate karma and bring it all back against them)<br/><br/>And about a thousand little things more. Even us who have been playing for a long time, still amaze at how other groups play the same games we've played.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423166/#Comment_423166" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-18T19:04:02+00:00" title="October 18, 2013  7:04PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 18, 2013 7:10PM by Rickard.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>"Play With Intent" (<a href="http://playwithintent.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://playwithintent.wordpress.com</a>) by Emily Boss and me is our attempt to do this.

Not knowing those tips may lead to initial frustration with what appears on the surface very simple.<br/><br/>I'm trying to think of something else comparable in the learning difficulty. The only example I can think of from my own life is silly: It's about as hard as learning how to paint the interior of your apartment.<br/><br/>It's something that seems really simple and straight forward, but I've seen people repeatedly screw it up royally. There are about 10-12 basic, easy-to-use techniques that are non-obvious to the beginner, that will make the whole thing vastly easier and produce a better result.<br/><br/>So yes, tips/techniques help, that's true. But at the end of the day, still not rocket-surgery and still well within the realm of what a regular person can accomplish.<br/><br/>And maybe that's the real difficulty with this stuff:<br/>1) Convincing people who think this is hard that it really isn't that hard.<br/>2) Convincing first-timers that think it's super easy to stop and read the tips first, for a better experience, rather than jumping in with both feet and ending up unhappy or overwhelmed.<br/>3) Figuring out the best delivery system for that info, so people will actually be willing to use it.<br/><br/>If there was a Point 4, it should probably be something about understanding that there are advanced and specialty techniques that achieve certain effects, but maybe that those advanced/specialty techniques really should be their own separate thing.<br/><br/>I would notably, under this point of view, pretty much consider any game you'd like to name that you can buy ( and many free ones) as an advanced, specialty technique cases.<br/><br/><br/>Edited to add:<br/>On a personal note, I think the idea that this stuff we is hard, or too hard for beginners, raises my hackles a bit because it seems to produce two effects I don't care for:<br/><br/>1) It reinforces an attitude that people in this hobby are somehow super-elite in their own way.<br/>2) It creates an excuse for lots of people to never actually meaningfully read or comprehend the methods ( rules in most cases of your average mainstream design) and simply rely on an Alpha Player/GM to shoulder the stuff that really makes this work.<br/><br/>And point 2 feeds back into point 1 in a nasty little reinforcing cycle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_423411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423411/#Comment_423411" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-27T16:44:52+00:00" title="October 27, 2013  4:44PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2013 7:13PM by The_Magus.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I want that mutability, that higher level of abstraction that can help me improvise the game I want for that specific situation. For that, I need not rules so much as a specific attitude (openness etc), and a big freaking toolkit so I can do what fits best at any time.</blockquote>\nI really liked Play With Intent and I've come across bits and pieces of it in yours and Emily's work.  I'm coming at these questions from a professional background in systemic psychotherapy, which involves working with families, couples and groups.<br/><br/>The psychotherapist, John Burnham, has developed a way of thinking about psychotherapeutic work called Approach - Method - Technique.  It\u2019s a simplified form of Barnett and Pearce\u2019s Co-ordinated management of meaning (CMM) and I think that its ideas extrapolate well to RPG theory as CMM is a pragmatic approach to communications theory.  Its organisation is hierarchical, with the higher levels creating a context for the lower.<br/><br/>An approach consists of assumptions, values, theories and ideas about RPGs in the broadest possible sense.  The approach level is the level in which we talk about RPGs, such as what are RPGs?  How do they differ from story games?  What are the differences between simulationism and narrativism?  \n<blockquote>I would actually start with :" What is a roleplaying game?", and I mean at its most basic level, and then talk about its common variations</blockquote>\nThis is a question of approach.<br/><br/>An approach consists of a number of methods.  Methods are they actual organisational practices that influence an approach.  In RPGs these are the ways of gaming and the games that embody these.  For example, the use of stances, simulationism as embodied by Basic Role Playing or Narrativism as embodied by Dogs in the Vineyard.  <br/><br/>Techniques are the activities that organise a method, the practices and tools that are learned by rote.  This can be viewed as things such as rolling dice to check for success or saying, \u201cdo it differently.\u201d<br/><br/>As was said the upper levels create the context for the lower and is by far the stronger influence.  The lower levels act on the upper in an implicative and therefore weaker way.  I think it is problematic to believe that that technique alone will answer the question of why a game plays well one day and badly the next with exactly the same people.<br/><br/>There is another concept from the world of systems theory based on ideas of Gregory Bateson.  Deutero-learning is the act of learning something and learning about how you are learning it as part of that process.  I wonder if such a game could be created?  I looked at Epidiah Ravachol\u2019s \u201cWhat is a roleplaying game?\u201d and John Harper\u2019s \u201cWhat to do if someone asks you about gaming\u201d and while both excellent they don\u2019t really tick the deutero-learning box.  World of Dungeons has a feedback loop in it where you can bring in your own rules, but this works mainly at the technique level.<br/><br/>There is a risk of attempting to design games that achieve a goal constantly, rather than gaining pleasure from the act of playing.  I\u2019m not sure how possible this is to achieve as we live in a culture that creates the illusion of fulfilling desires.  I would advocate for a gaming culture that sees value in the act of gaming - this is something we do at times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423424/#Comment_423424" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-28T01:25:56+00:00" title="October 28, 2013  1:25AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2013 2:38AM by Rafu.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Finally chiming in on this!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">@Matthijs</a>, I think the key to the matter is one of ease of communication. <i>Transmitting</i> the tenets of a methodology or culture of play is not an easy task. Books, in particular, are a super-clumsy tool for this.<br/>If, instead of books, we were <i>really</i> focused on oral tradition \u2014 say, a game-designer would rather run a seminar than write a book \u2014 then it would make sense to focus on methodologies, on shaping a specific culture of play, on building a team. In fact, several sub-niches of role-playing are exactly like that. Heck, I think <i>Nordic larping</i> is like that, which is a pretty natural consequence of the designers being event-organizers rather than book-writers.<br/><br/>Extrapolating from your <i>Playing at the World</i> example, Arneson there is the one with a culture-of-play approach because it's, in fact, what served him better to that very moment \u2014 while Gygax is the one with a background in publishing and with book-publishing ambitions.<br/>You can curse Gygax for this, maybe, but books did become the primary alternative medium to word-of-mouth for spreading role-playing games, in the long run turning an absolutely local phenomenon into something of a global one. But books which attempt to communicate a methodology and culture of play through <i>describing</i> it usually fail, IMO, and also make for either very challenging or very dull reads.<br/><br/>The state of art of "elegant" role-playing design focuses on "rules", I believe, as a technique for communicating style of play more compactly. If you can (and here's the primary skill of a game designer) boil down your desired play experience to a bullet-point list of "do this, then do that" and "if X, do Y" what you obtain is a tight set of instructions that prospective players need not "study" beforehand, just follow and apply. It's a hugely less flexible but dramatically more portable alternative to having the game-designer (or a stand-in "game master") present in the flesh to act as a teacher.<br/>In my opinion, it's "good" game-design when you lay out such rules that the desired methods and cultural properties, the core aspects of the designed experience are encoded into them rules and emergent from their interactions \u2014 so that such features of play will appear to a less-than-attentive observer to just magically come into being. It may not occur anybody that features of the experience were in fact <i>designed</i> to a degree. I also believe (and will stand for this belief against all comers) that you can't and shouldn't even attempt to design <i>all</i> parts of the experience of play through rules you can write down as an instructions text, and that's OK, and it's only "good" game-design if you as a designer can live with some things being out of your reach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423425/#Comment_423425" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-28T01:31:26+00:00" title="October 28, 2013  1:31AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, BTW: I'm coming at this entirely from a game-design perspective ("<i>Why am I personally designing games as sets or hard rules, rather than not?</i>").

Each genre should include a list of 8 different characters which would fit in them. Players then get to choose one type from each genre to create their characters.

Anything you want to do in the game should be resolved using one of these three procedures. If you've played before you can re-use some of the ones you've used previously, but always replace one of the used with a new one.<br/>c) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Objectives.</span> Roll for one general objective for the whole session. Acts as a winning condition.<br/><br/>Everything else is to be made up as you play, each player can add up to three rules/exceptions to other rules, but that's it. Write down the ones you've added and enforce them whenever they come up. You can add as a rule anything you've used in previous sessions. And you're free to correct ONCE any rule you've created, but only between scenes and you've to tell everyone when you do so.<br/><br/>Ok, it's quite raw; but if you notice, it's meant to work in several different ways:<br/>-Players get something clear to do from the start: it's a game about creating a game. Besides the "objective" rolled there's an implicit meta-objective shared by all the players: make the game work somehow.<br/>-Nobody needs to have previous background in roleplaying games, there's no need about further explanation from the basics beyond "you get to create and play a character, having adventures all players will create together in a world of your own" or sorta.<br/>-It limits players enough to give them a focus but otherwise gives them freedom to create rules and fluff.<br/>-It handles players the whole set of techniques and procedures, but doesn't make them learn them all before playing, just three at a time -which I hope would be the minimal to start the game. Each session the game becomes progressively complex or more streamlined.<br/>-If a session crashes, players would be able to point clearly at what rule, procedure or behavior was the problem, and rule it out on their next game.

Some elements of play culture can be captured by audio / video recordings.<br/><br/>2) Flexibly incorporating new and old practitioners of a certain play style can be aided by optional pick/roll lists.  Present a range of acceptable choices for everyone to see.  Allow (e.g.) the teachers to ignore the list as long as they can demonstrate the proper approach, the total noobs to roll on the list, and the in between folks to pick from the list.<br/><br/>The key for me is that the lists, whether fiction-based ("the character is injured") or social ("expand on what the last person said"), constitute a <i>statement</i> of what is appropriate play.  Without such a statement, you wind up with a toolkit that allows you to do whatever you want, which people will outgrow the need for pretty quickly.  I think <a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk%27s">@WarriorMonk's</a> idea would be a great "What is roleplaying?" option, but I doubt I'd use it once any sort of play culture had actually developed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423462/#Comment_423462" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-28T14:02:48+00:00" title="October 28, 2013  2:02PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Exactly, David! The OP's idea struck me like that: veteran roleplayers can improvise a game out of nowhere, so they don't actually need many tools. Newcomers on the other hand would need perhaps 2 months of experience with many different games before doing this; but with a proper procedure they will be able to start right away and learn/create most on the run. Learning the game isn't rocket science, but learning to make it work perfectly might be quite hard for some.<br/><br/>So, once you learn the basics, you could get rid of the book and play your way, or bring what you learned into other more complete and specialized RPGs. Hey, I'd include a disclaimer in the book stating that you must pass it on to another person that doesn't play RPGs once you're done with it.<br/><br/>Of course, you could also make an advanced version of this that could include more complex techniques and set ups, with a bibliography of online and offline material for inspiration.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423470/#Comment_423470" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-28T18:58:57+00:00" title="October 28, 2013  6:58PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2013 6:59PM by David_Berg.">edited October 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'd include a disclaimer in the book stating that you must pass it on to another person that doesn't play RPGs once you're done with it.</blockquote>This is brilliant!

Sometimes as a game designer I imagine (briefly, until I realize reality exists) that if I write the rules just right, I can make others achieve the same experience as I have when playing. That's a lie. So I agree with <a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a> there, you have to realize that some things are out of your reach as a game designer.<br/><br/>I was speaking to Eirik Fatland at Grenselandet about larp design. There's one of his larps he's never going to publish, because it works great when he and his crew runs it, but when others try to, it fails. Little details like where the spotlight is pointed or what exact words are spoken in the intro can change everything. <br/><br/>Without knowing the grand scheme, the aim of the game, it's very hard to know what bits are important, and how to fix things when they go wrong. On the other hand, if everyone shares the same approach, they will be able to mend a broken game easily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_423527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423527/#Comment_423527" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-30T09:35:07+00:00" title="October 30, 2013  9:35AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Write you rules enough times explaining them with different words and different examples, try to use graphics, show them in play through comic book-like approaches, be specific about crucial parts or requirements to achieve and hopefully at least one person in a playing group -most probably one with a similar mindset than the designer- will get it, explain it to the rest and maybe approach to the experience the Designer wanted to convey.<br/><br/>But only do that if you are a control freak, feel totally responsible of other people's fun or find exciting the challenge of making a book able to convey something more or less accurately. Otherwise, just throw the idea on the book, make the book concept a compellling idea, do your best to make your mechanics clear and let people do whatever they want with it either if they get it or not. Because once anything leaves the hands of their creators (and you'll find this is true for any artform) it doesn't belong to them, but to the audience.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_423534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/423534/#Comment_423534" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-30T11:56:00+00:00" title="October 30, 2013 11:56AM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think sharing &amp; reproducing an approach is a serious communication challenge, but I don't see why a book couldn't help immensely.  Just as we can aspire to design tools for meaningful resolution of fictional conflicts, we can also aspire to design tools for effective communication of an approach.  Acronyms, rhymes, catchy icons, and other mnemonics; clear and simple ideas with concrete examples; hierarchical breakdowns (like AW's agenda/principles/moves); scripts for facilitators to read; warm-up exercises to get the group into the proper headspace; I have hope!<br/><br/>Bring on the next generation of clapping at the corners from Society of Dreamers!<br/><br/>I also think that, just as "what you roll for" and "types of outcomes" can indirectly communicate fictional genre and thematic concerns, social rules like "on this turn your job is to support the spotlight player" and "anyone can nix a contribution that they find cheesy" and "raise your hand to speak out-of-character" can indirectly communicate a proper approach.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what the designer's intent or goal of Puppetland are, but the social techniques employed are so powerful that in <i>some</i> ways, you <i>have</i> to play with the proper approach.  (You could, of course, tell a wildly un-Puppetland story without technically breaking any rules... but the <i>way the story is told</i> will still be Puppetland.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
