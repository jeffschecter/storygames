We haven't had a chance to play it yet, but the rules read like a fairly standard party-type game - everyone has these cute cards, people go around and take turns choosing a card and coming up with a story-like sentence for it, then the other players each choose one of their cards that would match. You mix them all up, and people vote on which one fits best, and people get points depending on whether the other players chose theirs or not. Simple, but seems fun enough, and the artwork is very charming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278264/#Comment_278264" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T08:14:03+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  8:14AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just watched the Dice Tower's review of the game, and there are three things that make me VERY interested in this now:<br/><br/>-There are expansions available, so lots more variety.<br/>-The board is built into the box in a really cool way.<br/>-One very cleaver caveat to the rules is that you want people to guess what your card is, BUT NOT EVERYONE.

This is a deeper story game than Dixit. In Fabula, players create a story (like the Grim one's) togethers. There is a storyteller who chooses a picture and then he has to narrate around this picture. The others players will suggest the following story using stuff on the table and the Storyteller will choose one of them. It remembers me "A penny for my thoughts". The stuff on the table will be proposed by tokens printed.<br/>\n<br/>\nPictures of the materials : http://www.trictrac.net/index.php3?id=jeux&amp;rub=actualite&amp;inf=detail&amp;ref=8741                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278271">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doppelganger9" title="doppelganger9"><img alt="doppelganger9" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doppelganger9">doppelganger9</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278271/#Comment_278271" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T08:43:52+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  8:43AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello all,<br/>\n<br/>\nDixit is a Story game ?

It's vaguely reminiscent of Balderdash, in that everyone at the table is trying to both simultaneously deceive each other and pick the correct card.  But it also has the best part of Apples to Apples in that you just throw in a card rather than have to write some definition or whatever, which really slows things down and requires a whole other set of skills.  <br/><br/>Basically, the "Storyteller" picks one card from his hand, puts it facedown, and describes it using a sound, word, phrase, or sentence.  Everyone else then looks at their hand and tries to pick the card that would best fit that description as well.  The cards are then shuffled and flipped over, and all the players (non-storytellers) vote on which one is the original card played by the storyteller.  <br/><br/>Scoring goes like this: <br/>- If all or none of the players picked the storyteller's card, the storyteller scores nothing and the players all score 2 points (meaning that the storyteller tries to be somewhat vague in their description, but not make it too difficult that no one gets it)<br/>- If only some of the players pick the right card, then they and the storyteller get 3 points<br/>- Players also get 1 point if any other player pick their card instead<br/><br/>You play through the deck of incredibly beautiful and somewhat disturbing cards, and whoever has the most points wins!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278327/#Comment_278327" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T12:16:11+00:00" title="June 28, 2010 12:16PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wouldn't players who scored consistently low at this sort of a game end up feeling like total morons?

One thing, is that it is quite hard when it's your turn to actually decide which of your six cards to use, and then what to "say" (the "sentence") about that card. Otherwise, we liked every element of it.<br/><br/>Inside Joke for folks that have the game: I dig bizarre/ironic humor. Anyway, some of our "sentences" were rather esoteric. It just so happened that the last round I was the judge/sayer. I looked at my deck, picked one. My sentence was:<br/><b>"The Thermometer Bleeds Like a Snake"</b><br/>I collected everyone's cards, but made sure to shuffle them so that my card was on the bottom and would be revealed last. Then I started turning them over, one by one, watching their faces as they intently tried to determine which one was my card. Then the last one was revealed, which was, of course, <i>a picture of a thermometer, with the mercury part actually a snake made of blood, bleeding all over the place</i>. They didn't stop laughing for like a minute. You can only pull that joke once per group playing the game for the first time, tho. :-)<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_281318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/281318/#Comment_281318" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-17T13:31:12+00:00" title="July 17, 2010  1:31PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just have to ask, since it's Spiel de<i>s</i> Jahres, did you hear about this from a German/Austrian/Swiss/Dutch friend speaking in dialect?

In her last class she gave everyone a Dixit card and told them to write a 1-page story inspired by the cards.  Some write literal stories to tie in the elements of the card, others wrote about the feel of the card.
