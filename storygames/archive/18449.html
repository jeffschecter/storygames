The one thing I really miss in those hacks, though, is a weird stat, so I'm trying to shoehorn that back in somehow. I just really love weird as a salient dimension of character personality, and it still makes a lot of sense in this setting. In Mass Effect, at least, "super powers" are usually better described using cool or sharp; "weird" generally means either "alien" or "slightly insane." Examples of characters with decent weird scores include a scientific-test-subject-turned-cultist who was trained to enjoy pain (Jack: +3hard, +2weird); a brilliant scientist who constantly and rapidly speaks to himself (Mordin: +3sharp, +2weird); and a bunch of people who got the ability to communicate psychically after they all got possessed by a giant alien plant (Zhu's Hope colonists). <br/><br/>So, I've come up with (and repurposed) a bunch of +weird moves, but I'm kind of blanking on a good replacement for the basic move (normally "open your brain..."). Any suggestions for something weird that people might do that's still general enough that it could come up especially regularly? I anticipate this question coming up in plenty of other AW hacks, so please feel free to suggest stuff that isn't specific to any one setting. Starting points I'm working on so far include...<br/><br/>When you're influenced by something alien...<br/>When you sense things others cannot...<br/>When you draw on your unusual talent...<br/>When you suggest something so crazy it might just work...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/benhamill" title="benhamill"><img alt="benhamill" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/benhamill">benhamill</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415390/#Comment_415390" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T22:01:46+00:00" title="June  3, 2013 10:01PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, I would ditch Weird in a ME hack. I'd consider rearranging the stats A LOT, in fact. You have some examples of characters from the games that were weird, I admit. But what would Liara's or Garrus's Weird be? -3? To me, the easiest thing to do would be to just drop it from the setting. If I were to take a more in-depth run at a ME hack, I'd think long about whether I should have a stat each for Tech and EZo (that's what fuels biotics, right?) or whether to just model them with moves alone. And, relatedly, what the other stats should be. Not all hacks have 5 stats; Monsterhearts just has 4.<br/><br/>All that being said, I've started sketching out a hack that is cyberpunk themed (not shared any of it online yet) and I decided I wanted to keep <b>Open Your Brain</b>, but ditch the Maelstrom and Weird. So I made a stat to do with the internet (how good at computers are you, basically) and most people can roll to look things up. If you were really digging on the idea of asking and answering questions, you might could keep that within the ME fiction and just skin the stat right. But it doesn't sound like that's your drive, really.<br/><br/>I don't know if any of that's helpful to you at all. But just in case it is, there you go. Feel free, of course, to disregard it, if not. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415392/#Comment_415392" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T22:15:27+00:00" title="June  3, 2013 10:15PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the feedback! But I am still interested in the actual question at the start of that post: What would the weird basic move be if it really did just represent weirdness, not psychic affinity? <br/><br/>Feel free to whisper at me if you want to chat ME hacks, but I don't mean to encourage us to turn this into a thread on that particular project. I just wanted to give a sense of the angle I came at this question from. Right now I'm not prepared to build a hack from the ground up as extensively as something like Monsterhearts, which does such a great job of remaking the system into something all its own. (That said ... my wife insists that Liara should be at least +1weird. I mean, the social awkwardness alone from her hitting Shepard in ME1 should count for something. And yeah, Garrus could be +0 or -1, which is great! It tells us <i>he's a pretty not-weird dude</i> compared to some of the folks he hangs out with.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/benhamill" title="benhamill"><img alt="benhamill" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/benhamill">benhamill</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415394/#Comment_415394" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T22:33:42+00:00" title="June  3, 2013 10:33PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2013 10:34PM by benhamill.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK. So another angle that Vincent has sometimes mentioned on the AW fora is to think of it in terms of what the source characters actually DO. So what did being weird cause Jack or Modin (or Liara) to actually do in the fiction. It sounds like one thing you have in mind, is to say weird things in conversation. So maybe... "When you talk to someone important (in general or to you), roll+weird. On a 10 or higher {do or say something super awkward}. On a 7-9, {do or say something less awkward}. On a miss, you hold your shit together and don't embarrass yourself." People (me) say that ME is more about talking to people as it is about shooting stuff (if only by a little), so it makes sense to me for conversation to mechanized. That specific thing doesn't really inspire me, but maybe you can use it to get to an actually-good idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415395/#Comment_415395" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T22:34:19+00:00" title="June  3, 2013 10:34PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2013 10:36PM by Paul_T.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm with benhamill, above. There's not an easy replacement to a stat which is all about interaction with a fundamental feature of the game setting (here, the psychic maelstrom will underlies everything in Apocalypse World). If you take it out, take it out. I would probably replace it with some kind of "deal with technology" stat by default, as the most obvious choice.<br/><br/>Looking things up on the internet is a really interesting re-skin: but I feel that good moves give you some clear sense of why the move is dangerous, so the MC isn't totally lost when making a hard move in response. Looking things up on the internet would be an interesting move in a setting like the Matrix, for instance, where do anything connected to the Matrix is potentially dangerous, can attract unwanted attention, or have unexpected side effects (like going comatose or having your being taken over by a virus).<br/><br/>If nothing like that fits, and you don't want to get rid of weird altogether, give a thought to what characters who *are* weird can do in the setting. (I'm not familiar with Mass Effect.)<br/><br/>* Perhaps the "weird" characters can draw on personal reserves of strength or luck to do crazy stuff. Here, the basic move could be "When you attempt the impossible...", or an auxiliary move like, "When you push yourself beyond your limits, roll+weird", with the outcome affecting the roll of whatever you're actually trying to do.<br/><br/>* In AW, opening your brain is all about access to information you wouldn't normally have. If you can come up with how you can have access to information, and why accessing it is always in some way dangerous (like I did with the internet/Matrix concept above), that will work.<br/><br/>* It's also often used for weird or unusual moves. This makes it an interesting prospect: maybe it's not attached to any basic moves at all! However, lots of custom moves you create in the game (like interacting with weird technology or aliens or whatever) use it. Also, lots of lots of moves you can take with advances use the +weird stat. So, if you have a character with a high weird stat, you're less capable than other people at the beginning, but as you advance and explore the setting, you'll find that you're unexpectedly good at all kinds of stuff they can't do, like interacting with weird stuff or developing new abilities. (Stuff like the "augury" move in AW comes to mind, stuff which generally becomes more important later in the game.) This is probably how I would consider doing the Force in a Star Wars hack: someone like Luke Skywalker isn't as hot or hard or sharp as the others, but when he learns to interact with the Force by picking up advances, he discovers he's really got a gift for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/benhamill" title="benhamill"><img alt="benhamill" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/benhamill">benhamill</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415396/#Comment_415396" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T22:39:21+00:00" title="June  3, 2013 10:39PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2013 11:36PM by benhamill.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Looking things up on the internet is a really interesting re-skin: but I feel that good moves give you some clear sense of why the move is dangerous, so the MC isn't totally lost when making a hard move in response.

I feel like our thoughts on this are mostly converging, which is reassuring. In particular, I had weird shaping up to be something that sees more use as the game goes on and fiction demands it, with early game use potentially limited to "species moves" representing stuff aliens can do that would seem weird to other species. <br/><br/>(Edit just to clarify...) I'm not looking for a replacement information-gathering move for "open your brain" so much as a basic move that encourages weird characters to do weird things with some regularity. So yeah, asking "what weird things do weird people do?" seems like the most productive starting point, and making them kind of dangerous is definitely part of the fun.<br/><br/>Stuff I've been kicking around while awaiting responses...<br/><br/><b>When you're touched by something truly alien,</b> roll+weird. On a 10+, you get all 3 below. On a 7-9, choose 2. <br/>\u2022 It leaves you with an ability you didn't have before.<br/>\u2022 It causes you no immediate harm.<br/>\u2022\xa0It leaves no permanent visible mark upon you.<br/><br/><b>When you draw on your strange talent,</b> roll+weird. On a 10+, it works safely \u2013\xa0you see visions of doomed ancients, speak in the tongue of the robots, or whatever. On a 7-9, it works, but you strain yourself or freak people out; take -1 forward. On a miss, it may still work, but you're stunned, harmed, or out of control.<br/><br/><b>When you sense something that others cannot,</b> roll+weird. On a 10+, you make sense of it, might even be able to interact with it. On a 7-9, it's vague, confusing, maybe painful. On a miss, something senses you back.<br/><br/><b>When you propose something inane,</b> roll+weird. On a 10+, it's so crazy it just might work: NPCs will go along with it, and any PCs who join in mark experience. On a 7-9, some NPCs will still buy in (and PCs will still get experience for doing so), but there's a major flaw somewhere: Sooner or later someone will have to take -3 to act under fire. On a miss, NPCs know you're nuts and keep their distance, but PCs who sign on (and get that xp!) will <i>all</i> have to act under fire at -3 somewhere along the way.<br/><br/>(Trying to get away from Mass Effect, that last one was an attempt to make a +weird basic move that would fit into any of the TV shows I watch where "science" is basically "magic," like Dr. Who or Fringe.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415401/#Comment_415401" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-03T23:04:22+00:00" title="June  3, 2013 11:04PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2013 11:05PM by Paul_T.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><b>When you're touched by something truly alien,</b> roll+weird.

And, especially since you're just trying to cobble something together that'll get you through one journey rather than build something that'll drive across the country several times, that's probably where you want to be at anyway.<br/><br/>Just thought I'd point it out in case you were worried about missing having one of your players make up alternate lyrics to Gilbert &amp; Sullivan songs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415405/#Comment_415405" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T00:00:54+00:00" title="June  4, 2013 12:00AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, ME characters aren't weird and fucked up, they're disillusioned and embattled. <br/><br/>An ME hack doesn't need a <i>+weird</i> stat, it needs a <i>+hope</i> stat.<br/><br/>ME characters don't die, they give up. <br/>They don't retire to safety, they selflessly sacrifice their lives so that others may live.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415407/#Comment_415407" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T00:11:53+00:00" title="June  4, 2013 12:11AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2013 12:13AM by JasonT.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I read Mass Effect differently, but that's neither here nor there.

I don't think that Mass Effect was ever about <i>being weird</i> in the same manner as we think about <i>being weird</i> in Apocalypse World. Yeah, some characters ARE creepy or unnerving or awkward but I don't think that's a defining aspect of the series.<br/>However, I DO think that a defining aspect of the series is being <i>alien</i>. Mordin's weird, but a lot of his weirdness comes from taking his Salarian nature to the extreme. Biotics are touched by something that we don't really understand as human. The Zhu's Hope colonists were twisted into something not-quite-normal. But rather than just being strangeness, these things all distance themselves from our understanding of humanity. And this doesn't define species either - some aliens are quite human, while others of the very same species are wildly alien to us. Just look at the Yahgs - some, like the ones are Surkesh, were basically feral, while another particular one managed to have the galaxy fooled for decades that he was just like the rest of civilization. So even aliens could have an Alien of 0, and even humans can have an Alien of 2 or even 3 in the most bizarre cases.<br/><br/>I like this approach to the stat because it allows several things. It allows the stat to be act-like-Mordin in that he is an exaggeration of several major Salarian traits - hyperactivity and scientific brilliance. It allows the stat to be lick-alien-stuff in that, well, that stuffs nothing like what we understand. It allows the stat to be psychic, without making it <i>about</i> being psychic.<br/><b>When you perform maintenance on your enviro-suit, roll+Alien...</b><br/><b>When you scour the market for dextro-amino food, roll+Alien...</b><br/><b>When you link up to the Prothean beacon, roll+Alien...</b><br/><b>When you join minds and access the memories of another, roll+Alien...</b><br/>Basically, and this is what I would make the Basic Move,<br/><b>When you make use of your inhuman abilities, roll+Alien...</b><br/><br/>And I think being creepy and weird is also distancing oneself from the normal "human" as well, so it DOES cover the ground that Weird did.<br/><br/>My only concern is that it's a very human-centric seeming stat in a fiction that's very much about humans NOT being the center of the universe. But, as I think as humans this is our own primary measuring stick, it's not that big of a deal.<br/><br/>Side note: +Hope is really cool and in a complete ME hack overhaul I think it would be right at home, perhaps in place of +Cool even.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415425/#Comment_415425" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T08:04:49+00:00" title="June  4, 2013  8:04AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have been asking myself why this conversation keeps gravitating back to Mass Effect, despite me waving my hands madly and saying, "No really, I'm not asking about Mass Effect." Maybe it's time for me to break down and concede that this isn't just because people really like Mass Effect, but because I'm asking the wrong question \u2013\xa0not just for this hack, but for AW hacks more generally.<br/><br/>I was asking about what to do with weird because I love it as a character descriptor (I love weird characters) and as a scene prompt (I want weird stuff to happen). I figured that transcended any one hack, and we could come up with some weird moves that might work in a variety of games. What I'm hearing, though, is that <i>every stat needs to represent something crucial to your fiction,</i> describing not just people and situations, but the very kind of action you want to have in your game. Apocalypse World tells stories about being hard, cool, hot, and weird. Monsterhearts tells stories about people being cold, hot, dark, and volatile. Mass Effect has people in it who are weird, but it's not really about their weirdness. (This is why, I imagine, I've only ever seen <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?board=12.0" rel="nofollow">one AW hack</a> with a <i>quick</i> stat: In a system where timing and movement speed are handled very loosely, your movement speed is only relevant enough to be a stat if it's a game about something like parkour.)<br/><br/>So, am I just asking the wrong question? Perhaps it's hard to even think up a "generic" weird basic move because every move must reflect the story you're telling, and I'm trying to divorce the stat from the story.<br/><br/>(And as for using alien in place of weird: I actually used that exact same stat pretty much identically to how you describe in an earlier version of my notes. I abandoned it for the opposite of your concern, actually. I think Mass Effect actually IS pretty human-centered \u2013\xa0given that the games' protagonist must be human, and there are more named human characters than named alien characters by far \u2013 and having interesting +alien moves\xa0for everybody else may result in nobody actually wanting to play humans at all. But maybe going +alien instead of +weird is a better direction, as Mass Effect is very, very much about what it means to be \u2013\xa0and to interact with \u2013 aliens.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415443/#Comment_415443" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T10:14:21+00:00" title="June  4, 2013 10:14AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Perhaps it's hard to even think up a "generic" weird basic move because every move must reflect the story you're telling, and I'm trying to divorce the stat from the story.<br/></blockquote>\nI'd say that's about right.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/benhamill" title="benhamill"><img alt="benhamill" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/benhamill">benhamill</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415461/#Comment_415461" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T12:26:33+00:00" title="June  4, 2013 12:26PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.

Having ME so prevalent in the previous discussion made me continue along those lines - kinda self-perpetuating. Sorry that that wasn't the point ^_^'.<br/>But yeah, I don't you CAN have a generic, list of basic moves that can be pretty much always applicable. The Apocalypse World engine is a genre emulator, and a remarkable one at that. It is at its absolute prime when you use the stats, basic moves, and playbook selection to reinforce the specific genre or source material you're working with. When you make any hack, you should look at that as an individual thing and not try to plug in material from before based on a generic version. <br/><br/>I see where you're coming from though. I love the Weird stat. It, and its cousin Dark, are the reason I play those games a lot of the time. But then, when it came to doing my own hack, I realized that being Weird wasn't a very important part of the Avatar the Last Airbender world at all, so I axed the idea. <br/><br/>I think Weird occupies an interesting place in the design. The other four stats have very obvious mechanical places in any action game: they're the Defensive stat (Cool), the Violence stat (Hard), the Perception stat (Sharp), and the Social stat (Hot). That last spot though, Weird, I've found to be kind of a wildcard, the spot that gets taken by the idea that is most relevant to your setting. Weird is replaced by something that makes your setting's flavor shine through. In four-stat games, I don't see that wildcard slot dropped, I see the Perception stat dropped. Unfortunately for us Weird-lovers, that means we should play in settings where weirdness is an important factor - except when I phrase it like that, it makes perfect sense to do that.<br/><br/>As a side note, my own Avatar World has a "Fluid" stat that is used for the Basic Move "Move With Intention", so it's kinda about quickness, so there is another one out there. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>(To hit the ME thing for a moment more down here, away from my post body, I can see that point. It's true that the games are human-centric. However, I don't think the fictional universe is human-centric at all, and you see a lot of backlash from other species looking at the brash and arrogant way the humans are pushing themselves into everything, like the galaxy revolves around them. I think if I were to play in that universe myself I'd feel odd then measuring every character by how close they are to the standard human. It's definitely a bit troublesome trying to get people to play humans at all though with an Alien stat though. I think the key is that humans have talents too. The things that make humans special make them Alien to the REST of the galaxy. So perhaps if worded <b>"When you make use of your species' abilities, roll+Alien...</b>, now humans can trigger it, it's just a matter of thinking about what humans can do special. Maybe also <b>"When you interact with something whose very nature confounds you, roll+Alien...</b> cuz that sort of thing can be used by anyone. Also, Alien tripping for all biotics would give humans a good reason to use it)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_415469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/makrdp" title="makrdp"><img alt="makrdp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/makrdp">makrdp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415469/#Comment_415469" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-04T14:30:49+00:00" title="June  4, 2013  2:30PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            An example from a project I'm working on:<br/><br/>When you <b>open a device to the daemons of the digital maelstrom</b>, roll +wired.

It's one of the themes of the world, and any AW story is defined by it, or by its absence.<br/><br/>So what, in your universe, is something that's an ever-present part of the fiction? What's something that everyone has to confront or relate to? That's your version of the maelstrom. In a Scott Pilgrim universe, this would be "when you declare a showdown with a personal enemy...". In an Inception universe, this would be "when you bend the rules of the dream...".

Apocalypse Effect does well to situate <i>paragon</i> and <i>renegade</i> as important enough motifs to warrant stats, but only if you plan to run high-action where every PC steps up to be a hero/badass. Mass Effect: Apocalypse replaces <i>weird</i> straight up with <i>will,</i> which I found indistinguishable from <i>hard</i> or <i>cool,</i> and which feels as fictionally disconnected to me as my own failed implementations of <i>weird</i> \u2013\xa0more "this is something that might describe a character" than "this describes the kinds of stories I want us to tell."<br/><br/>I'm going to go with +alien for now and save +weird for a story/setting that really <i>does</i> weird.

We just ended up playing a much more pared-down game without moves. If I were to reapproach the game I was working on but use moves, I don't think I'd think of it this time in terms of "a replacement move for weird." Having played a bunch more PbtA games since I wrote this, I think you end up with better stats and moves by starting at what the genre demands, and crafting moves and stats around that. Or, now that there are so many PbtA games in a wider variety of genres, it's probably easier to borrow from a different genre game. Apocalypse World is a great game, but also produces a very specific kind of play that is harder to adapt for other genres than it might look at first. <br/><br/>So, maybe instead of looking for "a replacement move for weird," if I were making a Mass Effect game, I might look at existing games and ask: Which produces the kind of play I want? If I want a Mass Effect game based on combat missions, maybe I'd start with The Regiment: Colonial Marines and just add a playbook for space magic/biotics. If I want a Mass Effect game based navigating rival alien political factions, maybe I'd start with Urban Shadows, adapt Corruption for Paragon/Renegade tracking, and replace factions with factions from the game. Apocalypse World only feels like a good starting point for Mass Effect to me if I'm running a game on a lawless frontier or criminal world, and in that setting I could scrap Weird entirely or use it as-is if it makes sense in the specific setting. (There are scenarios in that video game where people do share consciousness, after all!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J" title="Kenny_J"><img alt="Kenny_J" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kenny_J">Kenny_J</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461628/#Comment_461628" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-03T21:26:51+00:00" title="April  3, 2017  9:26PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks. Yeah I agree its not strictly necessary, but I wanted to be on the up and up.<br/><br/>As for the rest of your advice/thoughts:<br/>I hear what your saying. I agree a lot with what was said here in this thread about it. And my own project has gone through iterations along with my own evolving experience and getting advice such as this. And yet I can't help it, I seem to still need to go through, create material based on what I was thinking, even if I feel like I might change it to something more streamlined or remove it entirely later. <br/><br/>And I get it, I am behind the curve on these hacks. I know that I am making mistakes that people have already made years prior to me and have since improved. But here I am anyway. I digress. <br/><br/>So for me I want to use this for my planet of the week hack, which I would say is trying to emulate monster of the week style of play in the sense of trope inspired TV/Movies but instead of fighting monsters, flying around in space. So I initially just adapted <i>Use magic </i>and replaced the magic words with technobable words. But after playtesting it wasn't clear to my players how to use it, and so in this massive re-write I'm doing I'm scrapping that and have a much simpler move for tech. <br/><br/>But the genre I'm trying to emulate is still very broad, and I know, I know, its clear to me now that the best advise is specific rather than broad, but <i>I</i> still want a broad game that can safely emulate lots of different planets, concepts and play styles. Everything from firefly, and farscape to startrek lite. Maybe that's a mistake but even still, I can at least learn from this project. I digress again.<br/><br/>So I kept weird as a stat, because I still want to keep my psychic playbook, my adept (space martial artist?), as well as sprinkle weirdness throughout the other playbooks. So I went to 6 stats, but massively reduced the basic moves. Still though I had room for at least 1 weird basic move, something i interpret as a weird peripheral move really. And your gem here was perfect. I adapted it a little but kept the main concept. I personally think it integrates nicely with what I have.\n<blockquote>Touch the Impossible:<br/>When you touch, interact, or are otherwise put in the way of something that defies explanation. <br/>Roll +Weird. On a 10+, choose all 3. On a 7-9 choose 2. On a miss choose 1 from below.<br/>\u2022\tYou develop an ability you didn't have before.<br/>\u2022\tThere is no immediate harm.<br/>\u2022\tThere is no permanent scaring. <br/></blockquote>\nOnce I get this finished I will post what I have over on the planet of the week thread. <br/><br/>Thanks again for your thoughts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
