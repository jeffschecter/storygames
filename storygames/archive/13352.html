That why the post-human intelligences in what is humanity\u2019s system of birth became the target of raiders from the million worlds that humanity now called home. These raiders looking enslave the powerful intelligences for use in projects ranging from war-making to exploration care little for the damage they did.   The intelligences that they damage care very much.   Now for the first time in eons in the mother system war is being discussed as a solution to a problem.  To help fight the war post-human intelligences are creating a special combat capable beings.   These Champions being created in theses cr\xe8ches have been told only two things.  Find our stolen children and bring an end to the raids  .   Everything else is irrelevant. <br/>\n<br/>\n9.\tGod-Killers <br/>\nDescription: Across creation there are beings of divine power, who actions make them dangerous and unpleasant.  Some are malice filled dark lords who poison everything they look at.  Others are so absolute in their moral righteousness that they threaten everything just as much as any would be dark lord.   Some are just too chaotic or quirky to fit into the reality well. To help combat these beings and ensure a balance of sorts a coalition of entities have come together under the banner of the God Killer to ensure order.  You have been recruited for your skills or perhaps simply your muscle to help them. <br/>\n\tPerhaps you will serve as a scholar/spy to learn what you can about the entity .  Maybe you will attack subtly with rumor and imported magic.  Perhaps you will come out as a champion to slay the god.  Maybe you will use the subtle knife itself and bring an end to the problem for all time.  <br/>\n<br/>\n10.\tThe Twisting Building <br/>\nDescription: Making  magic is about capturing the intangible and making it real through ritual and action .  One aware mystical practitioner a successful architect during the day is attempting to do this will a new building, and some unaware participants.

However, those inside will care very much by the end.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300978/#Comment_300978" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-16T09:33:20+00:00" title="November 16, 2010  9:33AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most of these sound pretty fun, Nick!  101 is a lot.

I'm looking for some feedback on how useful these ideas are for the purpose of being inspire to game with them.  Feedback on how to structure some of the less obivous ideas would be nice as well.  Some praise for some if not all of my ideas is also good.  As for the "Jinn Alliance" idea I think I made a mistake copying from Microsoft word into my post.  Since it does seem I can edit the post I'll just repost the idea in the next batch of ten.  <br/>\n<br/>\nNick                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marhault" title="Marhault"><img alt="Marhault" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FVPm0IriH9fQR-IQjP8BZg?authkey=Gv1sRgCK_6-fm2q9207gE&amp;feat=directlink"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marhault">Marhault</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301112/#Comment_301112" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-17T05:55:06+00:00" title="November 17, 2010  5:55AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.  I can see playing in a lot of these, given the right system.  They're pretty grabby.  None of them have me wanting to <i>run</i> them, however.  I'm not sure if that's just me, like I'm resistant to deliberate inspiration, or if you simply didn't post anything that hits my GM brain at the just the right angle.<br/><br/>PS, just for reference I like Ruin Runners and Last Crusade best out of this set.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/OrangeDice" title="OrangeDice"><img alt="OrangeDice" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/OrangeDice">OrangeDice</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301593/#Comment_301593" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-20T21:54:50+00:00" title="November 20, 2010  9:54PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love, love, love #1.  The fact that these people are created out of pretty much nothing, and what that means about them as real persons (or not)... that's a great premise.
