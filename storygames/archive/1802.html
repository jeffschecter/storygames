<p>So, uh, please help?</p>
<p>The way this works is, there are two characters in a conflict: The hero and the monster. They've put down some kind of bet. They roll some dice, and the one with the highest single die showing wins.</p>
<p>If there's a tie for highest die, or if the hero loses and he takes exception to this, then you get to do this cool escalation thing:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're breaking a tie, both participants must put up a new bet. If either one can't put something up, the conflict blows up in their faces. They both lose their most recent stakes. The tied dice stand for now, they'll get sorted out later.</li>
<li>If the hero is pushing, then he puts up a new entity, and the monster <em>may</em> but doesn't must.</li>
<li>Now roll the new dice, <em>keeping them separate from the old dice.</em></li>
<li>The new dice alone tell you the result of the newest stake. Again, the hero may push if he doesn't like the result of this stake, and the conflict escalates automatically on a tie.</li>
<li>The older sets of dice are all read by those dice plus the new dice, after factoring out ties. This sort of stack operation is kinda cool - you can do it by pushing the newest pool together with the older pool, clearing out ties, and checking the result for that step, before stepping back farther, if you have to. If the hero has extra pools, you just don't push together the monster's pools; compare monster pool <em>n</em> with hero pool <em>n+1</em> and then with <em>n &amp; n+1</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Except.</em></p>
<p>What this doesn't do is derive the right effect with the hero's pushing to win things he's lost; what I'd like it to do is that the hero can win conflict <em>n</em> by pushing and <em>probably losing</em> conflict <em>n+1</em>. Under this system, escalating will only help you turn around a loss by winning <em>both</em> stakes, which is lame.</p>
<p>Is there a straightforward way to change this around? I would like it to be such that you don't have to do any arithmetic; as with the current system, you can simply read the dice as they fall.</p>

                            I may not be understanding the current system completely, but what if the hero had an option to force the monster to use his best dice (of both rolls) in the second bet, so that when the dice were compared (afterwards) for the original bet the monster was no longer victorious? I.e. what if winning a later bet always required a sacrifice from the earlier bet pool?<br/><br/>So if we have, after one roll (using d6s):<br/><br/>Monster - 5 3 3 2<br/>Hero - 4 3 3 1<br/><br/>The Hero decides he wants to push, so:<br/><br/>Monster - 4 4 3 1<br/>Hero - 3 2 1 1<br/><br/>The Monster wins, but since he won a secondary stake he loses his top die from his previous pool. So when you compare the original pools the Hero wins with his 4.<br/><br/>This could always happen, or it could somehow be the hero's choice -- for example, if the hero won the second roll, but not with a high enough die to also win the first, he could do some similar switcharoo, purposefully throwing the second conflict in order to remove the Monster's high dice from the first round.<br/><br/>If the rule applied to the Hero as well, then this would also make it harder for them to win both conflicts, since winning the second would hurt their chances in the first. This creates some extra dynamics when it comes to making secondary bets (the monster might want to bet high, in order to preserve his original bet, for example.)<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Anyways, something like that. If winning a bet costs you dice from your remaining pools, or if advantage in the second roll can be traded in for enemy-disadvantage in the first roll (instead of just carrying that advantage back, which doesn't help if their high die is still higher,) that could achieve the effect you want.                        </div>

                            Shreyas,<br/><br/>It's hard to correct the effect in a void... we don't know what kind of dice you're using or where they come from so it's hard to parse out... at least it's hard for me to parse out.<br/><br/>Some options:<br/><br/>-Whatever kind of dice the Hero is rolling in the Monster gets too.<br/>-The monster always get a reinforcement dice in this subsection of the conflict that makes him harder to beat<br/>-the same pools on both sides are rerolled, but the monster gets to add his margin of victory to his new result.<br/>-the monster's pool stands + his earlier margin of victory, the hero rolls whatever new resources he can muster against it.`                        </div>

                            Shreyas,<br/><br/>You might try this.  When you escalate you roll up a new pool of dice.  Then you decide whether to keep any given dice in the new pool for the new conflict or send them back to the old pool for the old conflict.  Once you resolve the new conflict throw away any dice left in that pool and go to the old conflict (which may have new, higher, dice).<br/><br/>So let's say that you're rolling two dice in the first conflict and you have 3, 4.  The Monster rolls one die and has a 5, 5.  Next conflict you roll a 5, 6 and the monster rolls 5, 5 again.  You can use the 6 to win this conflict, or you can send it to your old pool to win that conflict.<br/><br/>I don't know whether you can send the 6 to the first pool and then escalate again in hopes of getting dice for the second pool.  But that could be cool.<br/><br/>One thing this does though is let you choose after the fact.  In my above example I know I can win on or the other.  I get to pick which one I win, there's not really any risk after the dice are on the table.  Of course I might not have rolled that six, in which case I would have lost both stakes...<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Thomas's idea is very close to my idea.  I'd recommend <i>trading</i> dice between the new pool and the old pool, but other than that we're on the same wavelength.  Give the hero the chance to shift away resources from one roll to another, in order to get the "lose one in order to win the other" effect.                        </div>

                            Oh, yeah, here's something I didn't notice when I was writing that up.<br/><br/>While it seems obvious in the example I presented that the hero is taking a big risk on that second roll, trying to get a six to win over on the first, if both palyers roll poorly on the first, then escalation is probably in the hero's favor.  So if the hero rolls 1, 3 and the monster rolls 2, 3 on the first conflict, then then the hero just needs any die that's not a 1 to go to that pool to win.  Rolling a second conflict is still a risk of course, but it's not really a risk because he needs to send his best dice to the first conflict.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>
