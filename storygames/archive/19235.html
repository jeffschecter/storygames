I'll offer an idea that I've been musing on in relation to 4th edition:<br/><br/>I might be more interested in 4th edition D&amp;D if the players had more say in the strategic-level setup of the individual skirmish combat encounters. You could maybe, depending on the specific nature of this adventure, attempt to inject a little bit of that into the proceedings. For example, if there is a common monster that shows up regularly in the encounters, perhaps let the players have one encounter with them and after that leave it more up to them to determine how many of these beasts they can beat in a single encounter; this might make it more interesting for the players, as they'd have to gauge their capabilities against the monster. You could achieve this "bidding" conceit in setting up the game in different ways, depending on what the adventure is about exactly: maybe there's a choice of roads where on one road you encounter 5 monster As and 1 B leading them, while on the other there's just 10 monster As, and the players get to choose which they want to face. Or maybe they can besiege the enemy at the cost of 100 gp per day, and each day spent on the siege causes one enemy to surrender, so it's up to them how much time and money they waste before they decide that they're strong enough for the fight. That sort of thing.<br/><br/>I guess almost anything I might suggest regarding expanding the metaplot into actually functional strategic concerns would necessarily mean a lot of work in rebuilding the adventure, as you'd need to prepare for when the players do something differently from the assumed plot railroad.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most realistic approaches to making 4th edition enjoyable without entirely rebuilding its high-order structures are to either give to some dullards to play (somebody who'll enjoy enacting the mechanics for their own sake), or give the players some personal psychological stake in succeeding in individual skirmishes as challenges to their tactical wit (often requires something of the sort I outlined above; players who are being railroaded from encounter to encounter rarely make that personal commitment to victory in my experience), or make it a storytelling game where you focus on letting the players talk about <i>how</i> their characters do the things they're going to do anyway. I've seen all of these approaches enjoy some success, although that last one is probably the most common: narrate engagingly, let the players participate in coloring in the fictional details, smile benevolently and support the coolness of their characters when the players make initiatives about establishing their characters as cool, and in general enable the players to enjoy the railroad in style.<br/><br/>An example of what not to do, from the first time I played 4th edition D&amp;D: my character was a dwarf, a bit of a jerk and a racist, from a clan that used kobolds and assorted other "animals" in their cuisine; he was dreaming of starting a restaurant business, and had an endless litany of behaviorist psychological doctrine to back up his insistence that his chosen prey animals weren't sapient. The GM reacted to my gallows humor somewhat hostilely because it wasn't clean-brow enough for him, so instead of supporting my concept he insisted on generally causing mundane trouble for my dwarf when an opportunity came up. This led into game time being wasted in e.g. bickering about door repair costs with a tavern owner, and other such highlights of play. Naturally this frustrated me somewhat as a player, and made me enjoy the "proceedings" less: I was forced to choose between entertaining myself and others with the antics of my dwarf, and letting the boring plot railroad proceed unhindered, with myself essentially reduced into a dice-rolling automaton.<br/><br/>If you can avoid that mentality and instead back the players up, whatever kinds of heroes they envision they'd like to play, I'm sure that you'll have a much better chance of getting into the groove with 4th edition style game. Just let the players immerse themselves in their carneval, whether dramatic or comedic or whatever, throw them some scenes, and you'll probably find that as long as you let them play their characters color-wise however they want, they'll generally follow your plot wherever it needs to go. Combats can be run in a light-hearted manner, as opportunity for showcasing character personalities and varied monsters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Crunch" title="Crunch"><img alt="Crunch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Crunch">Crunch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428571/#Comment_428571" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T14:00:57+00:00" title="February 21, 2014  2:00PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hate to be negative, but the ONLY thing I've found to work with 4E is to ignore the advertising that claims it's an RPG and play it like a tactical adventure board game. If you treat it more or less like Descent you can get only slightly sub Descent level play out of it... The combat still takes much too long, with much too little variation, but at least you don't have the frustration of trying to make it function in RPG terms. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MrTambo" title="MrTambo"><img alt="MrTambo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MrTambo">MrTambo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428572/#Comment_428572" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T14:09:03+00:00" title="February 21, 2014  2:09PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scourge of the Sword Coast is actually written for D&amp;D Next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428574/#Comment_428574" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-21T14:13:16+00:00" title="February 21, 2014  2:13PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How's Next in structural terms, anyway?

For 4e they were each 30-45 minutes long, and yes, continuity MUST be bad for this because you don't know who's going to be in the next session.  <br/><br/>Since D&amp;D (at least Advanced 2e and onwards) is an action game, they don't want to fuck around with anything else. <br/><br/>Similarly for the desire to have more player input into the setup of set pieces - Encounters are almost entirely set up explicitly for people who wouldn't know how to do that and probably wouldn't want to. Encounters is really a top-notch, highly-focused marketing thing and maybe the first really new innovation in adventure writing in a long time. Releasing them for an edition not out yet is brilliant - but of course playing them when you already have a D&amp;D experience you desire is not going to give you the experience you want.

I see people here telling me they think 4E was BadWrongFun, and that's okay -- it's an opinion. 4E is never going to be my first choice, but I know tactical people like it a lot.<br/><br/>Anyway, Scourge is written for 5E, which is being designed to attract back players of all editions of D&amp;D. It has some of the 4E mechanics people liked, and a lot of customization options, like 3.5, but it's also got a lot of old-school feel. Anyway, I'm liking it as a story-telling role-playing game -- they've used some story-game ideas, like tying skills to backgrounds instead of character classes, and mixing up the options a lot more so that you can combine class features you like in interesting ways.<br/><br/>Making the game interesting in D&amp;D Next is a lot like making a game interesting in any other RPG -- it requires an investment from the DM and from the players. When I run, I use the agenda from Apocalypse World: be a fan of the player characters, make their lives interesting, and ask questions and use the results.

You'd be hard-pressed to find people to say nice things about it in most RPG forums, and that's a reputation Wizards earned for it. I'm not a fan myself. I ran 4E for three years, and it's like the game was actively constructed to provide players a way to avoid roleplaying and concentrate on the tactical features -- which it probably was. But I've successfully roleplayed during a Monopoly game; if people enjoy the story-gaming, there is no game I've come across where it is impossible to role-play.<br/><br/>And please take my fronts as suggestions -- I didn't put more than five minutes into them. Reread the module with an eye towards picking out the elements. One of the worst things I can say about 4E is the way the modules were written made it easy to be a lazy DM and just follow the script, because redoing the encounters at higher levels required more work than under the previous editions and I never felt I could just adjust on the fly without unbalancing the mechanics. However, that is a DM problem, not a problem of the game -- in other words, I let the tools make me lazy when it came to DM skills. Nobody came by to give me a DM-lobotomy.

Does anybody know? My impression is that it's not a significant departure from the 4th edition in philosophical terms, but I haven't heard anybody describe it in any except mechanical level, so maybe it is.</blockquote>\nFrom what we've seen, it has the same basic unified mechanical structure as 3.0, a mode of play that feels like late AD&amp;D 1e without all the weirdnesses that people ignore (no Exceptional Strength, Weapon vs AC tables, etc.), and most of the ideas from 4e that made their way into Pathfinder.  It's D&amp;D - but trying to be all things to all people, and 4e fans are the least happy with it while the people who don't often give WotC money are most happy.\n<blockquote>Some of the dismissals of 4e sound like the same way some people dismiss OSR gaming. Maybe we need to have some threads about what people like about 4e-style gaming and what can be learned from it?<br/></blockquote>\nHonestly what I learned from it was a very solid grounding in GMing.  Possibly Apocalypse World and Fate Core would have been better to learn on - but I'm not even sure about them (and they weren't out then).  Skill Challenges are a narrativist mechanic that wandered in from somewhere (and were hideously explained) - but most of 4e has the Narrativist "Don't write down theoretical capabilities - write down what people actually do" approach, with Skill Challenges being still one of the best general tools for a lost GM to deal with Insane PC Plans that I'm aware of.  Even 4e's biggest weakness at a gameplay level (combat takes too damn long and there needs to be a quick resolution system to deal with muggings) is actually a strength for a new GM because it allows them to take half an hour's worth of break from a different form of insanity.  And as a boardgame it makes Descent seem ... weak, limited, and repetitive even with a GM who's entirely lacking in imagination.\n<blockquote><br/>I wasn't picking on anyone in particular. You'd be hard-pressed to find people to say nice things about it in most RPG forums, and that's a reputation Wizards earned for it. I'm not a fan myself. I ran 4E for three years, and it's like the game was actively constructed to provide players a way to avoid roleplaying and concentrate on the tactical features -- which it probably was.</blockquote>\nApparently "Most RPG forums" doesn't now include RPG.net (which skews very heavily pro-4e among the D&amp;Ds).  It doesn't include ENWorld (yeah, we're outnumbered there. And?  That's not the same as hard to find).  It doesn't include the WotC boards.  So which forums are you thinking of?  The Paizo boards?  The Gaming Den?  The RPGSite?  Dragonsfoot?  Yes, between those four sites you'll be hard pressed (although I know someone in real life who posts at both the RPG Site and Dragonsfoot and calls 4e his favourite version of D&amp;D).  The two biggest independent RPG sites by a wide margin are RPG.net (very pro 4e on the D&amp;D forum) and ENWorld (plenty of 4e fans).  So to rephrase your statement "You'd be hard-pressed to find people to say nice things about it in most small, isolated RPG forums and forums set up round specific games to which it is a huge competitor".<br/><br/>As for the game being constructed to provide players a way to avoid roleplaying - perhaps it was.  It was also the only D&amp;D edition ever that gave more tools to roleplaying than simple skill checks or zapping things with spells or an incredibly clunky alignment system.  It has a range - this is a feature, not a bug.  (It's also the best survival horror game I know (other than Dread) this side of All Flesh Must Be Eaten; you wouldn't believe how paranoid players get if you deny them their five minute rests or just houserule short rests to take an hour and a meal, and extended rests to take days).<br/><br/>Finally:\n<blockquote>An example of what not to do, from the first time I played 4th edition D&amp;D: my character was a dwarf, a bit of a jerk and a racist, from a clan that used kobolds and assorted other "animals" in their cuisine; he was dreaming of starting a restaurant business, and had an endless litany of behaviorist psychological doctrine to back up his insistence that his chosen prey animals weren't sapient. The GM reacted to my gallows humor somewhat hostilely because it wasn't clean-brow enough for him, so instead of supporting my concept he insisted on generally causing mundane trouble for my dwarf when an opportunity came up. This led into game time being wasted in e.g. bickering about door repair costs with a tavern owner, and other such highlights of play. Naturally this frustrated me somewhat as a player, and made me enjoy the "proceedings" less: I was forced to choose between entertaining myself and others with the antics of my dwarf, and letting the boring plot railroad proceed unhindered, with myself essentially reduced into a dice-rolling automaton.</blockquote>\nIndeed.  Passive aggressive GMing is not a good means of GMing.  And doing things you know piss off the GM (as you were from the way you relayed the story) is every bit as bad manners.  <b>A GM does not have the obligation to support all possible character concepts, and especially not ones that revolt the GM.</b>  And that the GM chose not to support a concept that was by your own admission a racist jerk, as well as arguably a cannibal (English doesn't really have a word that fits, but cannibal comes closest).  Instead the GM got them into trouble - as you'd expect a racist jerk with unsavory habits to.  Whether the GM was justified or not, this certainly isn't a strike against 4e (or indeed any other RPG).  And if you think that the only way you can not be bored is to play a racist jerk who's a borderline cannibal then I don't think that the problem is either with the GM or the system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428705/#Comment_428705" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-24T09:11:10+00:00" title="February 24, 2014  9:11AM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Insofar as it matters, Francis, I didn't intend to attack a game you like in what i wrote up there; I was merely attempting a strikingly clear illustration of how I think D&amp;D 4th edition (and certain similar games, e.g. Exalted) differs from many other rpgs, and how the GM should adjust their technique of play from pushing and constraining players to encouraging their unique character play (as a trade-off for their ability to influence the plot, to be specific).

My favorite Encounters sessions included:<br/><br/>- interesting lore/plot (this is largely given to you, but somethings you can work with the box text to pop even more, enhance exploration, etc)<br/>- embrace the fight and go for that fair-but-challenging zone (if you're playing Encounters, you're engaged in the challenge of the encounter, so play it to the hilt so people can enjoy it)<br/>- more characterization, even of enemies (and this was hit and miss, because sometimes there was a really evocative GM who got a sorta meh response, but as often: more performance / characterization simply made things more fun)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlHazred" title="AlHazred"><img alt="AlHazred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/958/n7WXWM1AOQF8E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlHazred">AlHazred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428715/#Comment_428715" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-24T12:05:36+00:00" title="February 24, 2014 12:05PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Apparently "Most RPG forums" doesn't now include RPG.net (which skews very heavily pro-4e among the D&amp;Ds).</blockquote>Ah, well, and the D&amp;Ds are the only part of RPG.net? Plenty of people discuss D&amp;D in TRO, but don't go to the D&amp;D forums because that's not their primary focus -- like me. That doesn't mean they don't play ever. Among them, there are few real fans.\n<blockquote>It doesn't include ENWorld (yeah, we're outnumbered there. And?  That's not the same as hard to find).</blockquote>Aha, I see. You are correct. I used a generalization ("hard-pressed") when I should have been precise ("outnumbered") -- then you would have no ability to deflect from the thrust of my statement by picking on my wording. Very clever! Ho ho! You got me!\n<blockquote>It doesn't include the WotC boards.</blockquote>No argument there. They are not hard to find there. However, I think that most of the people there will play the current D&amp;D being produced regardless of edition. Just so long as it doesn't feature Damage On A Miss.\n<blockquote>So which forums are you thinking of?  The Paizo boards?  The Gaming Den?  The RPGSite?  Dragonsfoot?  Yes, between those four sites you'll be hard pressed (although I know someone in real life who posts at both the RPG Site and Dragonsfoot and calls 4e his favourite version of D&amp;D).  The two biggest independent RPG sites by a wide margin are RPG.net (very pro 4e on the D&amp;D forum) and ENWorld (plenty of 4e fans).  So to rephrase your statement "You'd be hard-pressed to find people to say nice things about it in most small, isolated RPG forums and forums set up round specific games to which it is a huge competitor".</blockquote>Um... Who are you angry at here? Me? You are obviously a fan because it has features you find important in a game. That's great! If you were at my 4E table at Dreamation or DexCon, you'd find no fault in my presentation. But that doesn't mean I'm a fan of 4E -- I'm a fan of providing exactly the kind of experience you're looking for when you sit down at the table. I don't have to cater to you, I have to cater to the demographic of the slot I'm scheduled for.\n<blockquote>As for the game being constructed to provide players a way to avoid roleplaying - perhaps it was.  It was also the only D&amp;D edition ever that gave more tools to roleplaying than simple skill checks or zapping things with spells or an incredibly clunky alignment system.  It has a range - this is a feature, not a bug.  (It's also the best survival horror game I know (other than Dread) this side of All Flesh Must Be Eaten; you wouldn't believe how paranoid players get if you deny them their five minute rests or just houserule short rests to take an hour and a meal, and extended rests to take days).</blockquote>Okay, so features you like are actual features and features you don't are "incredibly clunky." I had several people at the con (20s of people) come up and express happiness that Wizards is going back to 9-faceted alignment. My backgrounnd comes from Hero System where your motivation can be precisely defined mechanically; only having 9 definitions of motivation seems incredibly constrictive to me. But that's my preference. <br/><br/>And if you've read Eero's comments about Primordial D&amp;D, you'd know that the Player-DM economy he describes requires absolute adherence to established rules. Doing something arbitrary like "denying them their five minute rests" impacts the player buy-in and might hamper the game.<br/><br/>I suspect based on the 4E designer's blog comments that his goal was to reduce considerably (if not eliminate entirely) the "slow" parts of gaming, which are the talking and haggling and negotiation of regular play, to focus on the tactical combat aspects which are his favorite part of gaming. I suspect Hasbro thought it might be able to pull some of the computer RPG players who exist in large numbers. Based on anecdotal evidence from the three game store owners I know, I don't think they were able to attract more gamers into 4E than previous players they lost due to the widely divergent goals of 4E versus other editions.\n<blockquote>Indeed.  Passive aggressive GMing is not a good means of GMing.  And doing things you know piss off the GM (as you were from the way you relayed the story) is every bit as bad manners.  <b>A GM does not have the obligation to support all possible character concepts, and especially not ones that revolt the GM.</b>  And that the GM chose not to support a concept that was by your own admission a racist jerk, as well as arguably a cannibal (English doesn't really have a word that fits, but cannibal comes closest).  Instead the GM got them into trouble - as you'd expect a racist jerk with unsavory habits to.  Whether the GM was justified or not, this certainly isn't a strike against 4e (or indeed any other RPG).  And if you think that the only way you can not be bored is to play a racist jerk who's a borderline cannibal then I don't think that the problem is either with the GM or the system.</blockquote>Every player at the table should have his moment in the spotlight. Every single one, no matter how dumb I may personally think their character is. But when the character-as-made hampers the other players enjoyment of the scenario then, as DM, I have to take steps. I don't care if the player is a jerk to me; I have a think skin. But they can't be a jerk to another player, or their character as a proxy.<br/><br/>If the cannibal dwarf was hampering the other players' enjoyment of the game, then I would probably have tried to gently nudge the player by enforcing the consequences of their actions (a hard move). Most of the societies in the fiction have severe penalties for cannibalism, and I tend to play NPCs as being bigoted to some degree. If the human authorities found a cannibal dwarf, they'd be more than happy to lock him up until he can be sent off on some damn-fool errand to the back-side of beyond (i.e., the adventure hook). Before it escalates further, I'd have a talk with the player to try to see if there was some way to accommodate his character with the rest of the party.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlHazred" title="AlHazred"><img alt="AlHazred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/958/n7WXWM1AOQF8E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlHazred">AlHazred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428719/#Comment_428719" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-24T12:16:20+00:00" title="February 24, 2014 12:16PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2014 12:16PM by AlHazred.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should mention, we're getting wildly off-track here, me included. This is a thread for discussion of expanding <i>Scourge of the Sword Coast</i>.<br/><br/>It looks like there's going to be (in the fiction) some massive plot by the Red Wizards of Thay to invade and conquer near Waterdeep. It's too early to say even what the essence of the sequel adventure will be, but I'd be surprised if it didn't take place entirely within Waterdeep or Thay (or both). If the players have read the Forgotten Realms books, I'd pick snippets of that to spice up the adventure -- everybody likes meeting NPCs they've heard of.<br/><br/>Another thing I do is include cameos of NPCs from previous Encounters modules. The players who've been with you long enough to remember the previous module are usually thrilled they can continue to build a relationship with an NPC they may have liked. In Season 15: <i>Murder in Baldur's Gate</i>, I had: Enda Yate (halfling bandit leader from Season 12: <i>Against the Cult of Chaos</i>); Lady Sala Nidris (Calishite merchant princess from Season 13: <i>Storm Over Neverwinter</i>); and, Barcero (Sembian mage conspirator from Season 14: <i>Search for the Diamond Staff</i>). In this one, you could pull Coran or Rilsa Rael from <i>Baldur's Gate</i>, or Hengar Aesnvaard (human barbarian) or Helda Silverstream (dwarf merchant) without too much explanation or excuse.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon" title="Neonchameleon"><img alt="Neonchameleon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neonchameleon">Neonchameleon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428730/#Comment_428730" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-24T16:43:56+00:00" title="February 24, 2014  4:43PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Ah, well, and the D&amp;Ds are the only part of RPG.net?

"If we ignore the part of RPG.net for the discussion of D&amp;D and instead go to TRO where there are explicitely no threads about D&amp;D then we have problems discovering positive threads about D&amp;D 4e because they are all in the section of the boards that actually have threads about D&amp;D".  Well, I suppose if you redefine your statements like that you can have the answer you want.\n<blockquote>Aha, I see. You are correct.

You are redefining your argument to something very different - from "hard-pressed to find people to say nice things about it in most RPG forums" to "easy to find a number of people who will say bad things about it".  These do not come close to being equivalent statements.  It is <em>incredibly easy</em> to find fans of 4e on message boards - especially the two biggest RPG message boards.  It's also very easy to find detractors.\n<blockquote>Just so long as it doesn't feature Damage On A Miss.</blockquote>\nI think you mean just so long as it does feature damage on a miss <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>  (For those not in the loop, ENWorld has recently created a special subforum specifically for the subject of damage on a miss because there has been a ridiculous amount of arguing about this recently).\n<blockquote>And if you've read Eero's comments about Primordial D&amp;D, you'd know that the Player-DM economy he describes requires absolute adherence to established rules. Doing something arbitrary like "denying them their five minute rests" impacts the player buy-in and might hamper the game.</blockquote>\nAnd this is a misunderstanding of what I am actually doing.  Denying PCs five minute rests is in no sense changing any of the rules as written.  It is using the actual rules as written.  You deny the PCs their five minute rests <em>by harrying them every few minutes</em>.  Nowhere in the rules of 4e does it say "The DM shall never leave less than five minutes between skirmishes and never interrupt a short rest", merely that a short rest takes about five minutes.  Making the five minutes real actively increases player buy-in in my experience.\n<blockquote>Based on anecdotal evidence from the three game store owners I know, I don't think they were able to attract more gamers into 4E than previous players they lost due to the widely divergent goals of 4E versus other editions.</blockquote>\nBased on <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/trends/explore#q=Dungeons%20and%20Dragons%2C%20D%26D&amp;cmpt=q" rel="nofollow">google trend analysis</a>, D&amp;D was haemorrhaging numbers and popularity before 4e.  From January 2004 to January 2008 (i.e. 6 months after the release of 3.5 to four years later), popularity approximately halved.  From January 2009 to January 2013 (an equivalent period of time), popularity was almost exactly unchanged.  Yes, it didn't revitalise D&amp;D in the face of World of Warcraft.  It merely made WotC hundreds of thousands of dollars per month from D&amp;D Insider alone (despite the murder/suicide that derailed the online initiatives) and stopped a very sharp downward trend.  Not as good as hoped, but pretty profitable all the same.  (I actually think that if the WotC D&amp;D team had had a clue, the best possible thing that could have happened to 4e would have been the rise of Pathfinder in the same way that Coke would have had to invent Pepsi if they didn't have a competitor - but they didn't).  There's been such a move to digital and Amazon that neither of my two local (u)FLGSs bother to stock RPGs any more - but in the same area we've multiple thriving RPG groups.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Anyway, this is getting waaaay offtopic.  Which is hot to spice up the latest round of Encounters when Encounters is pitched deliberately at the lowest common denominator and not made to be complex.  I think the answer to that is, assuming you have a fixed group rather than dropins (Encounters being deliberately linear so you can just turn up and DM or play) as suggested to take ideas from Dungeon World.  <a href="http://www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?352504-Thoughts-on-Dreams-of-the-Red-Wizards-Scourge-of-the-Sword-Coast" rel="nofollow">ENWorld appears to think you can turn it into a sandbox</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1ygdhj/mike_schley_delivers_highres_maps_for_scourge_of/" rel="nofollow">get map printouts that aren't marked with secrets so you can hand them out and use them on the table.</a>  But it ain't great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_428734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428734/#Comment_428734" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-24T17:24:15+00:00" title="February 24, 2014  5:24PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me suggest that we cool it on posting (and getting off-topic) until we hear more from Lula.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_428735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlHazred" title="AlHazred"><img alt="AlHazred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/958/n7WXWM1AOQF8E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlHazred">AlHazred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/428735/#Comment_428735" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-02-24T17:24:31+00:00" title="February 24, 2014  5:24PM">February 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2014 6:24PM by AlHazred.">edited February 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know what, I'm done.
