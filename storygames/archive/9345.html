Here's what I want:<br/><br/>* Binary sanity: you're sane (enough to get by, anyway), or not.<br/>* Some way of tracking how close you are getting to insane.<br/>* Some way of deciding whether you get closer to insane upon experiencing something horrible.<br/>* Some way of <i>regaining</i> sanity before you hit the breaking point.<br/><br/>Hitting the breaking point removes the character from the player's control. At that point, different things happen to him based on the character's class. For instance, a Cooler goes nuts, disconnects his Personal Refrigeration Unit, and cools ALL magic in a huge radius until his blood boils out of his ears. A Maddog goes all Friday the 13th on your ass, chasing you around the dungeon relentlessly and trying to kill you just for being alive. A Tattooist loses control of his magical tattoos, and they <i>escape</i>.<br/>Basically, the point is that something bad happens, and the character is essentially removed from play permanently.<br/><br/>My main problem here is numbers. I have no idea how to express any of this in numbers (or some other method, whatever). I don't actually have any familiarity with sanity mechanics in other games.<br/><br/>The other thing is, how do you get it back? I'm hardpressed to think of something there, but it seems necessary, considering how harsh the results of insanity are.<br/><br/>Any ideas?<br/><br/>-Marshall                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207156/#Comment_207156" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-13T15:17:08+00:00" title="May 13, 2009  3:17PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Call of Cthulhu <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/campaigns/sanity.htm" rel="nofollow">Sanity mechanic</a> is now part of the SRD for D&amp;D 3rd so available for use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207970/#Comment_207970" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T12:12:06+00:00" title="May 18, 2009 12:12PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, thanks!

Cool idea, but daunting.<br><br>Anyone up for brainstorming? What are some discrete problems affecting your mental state that you can suffer while dungeoneering in a world sorta like ours but rundown and weird?<br/>And, if you wanna, what are specific mechanical effects that can occur? The system is task-based. It uses d20 rolls; roll high, but under your attribute (there are 5: HIT, SEE, THINK, MOVE, ENDURE; they range from 3 to 18, although less than 8 is unlikely). Bonuses and penalties are in the form of extra dice: rolling +1D means you roll 2 dice (the base die, and one extra) and take the best; rolling -1D means you roll 2 dice and take the worst.<br/>There's also a healthy dose of GM determinism. When something comes up that there's not a rule for, the GM can just decide it or call for an attribute roll (GM is required to abide by all dice results when dice are rolled). If there's already a rule for it, you follow the rule.<br/><br/>Some obvious ones out of the way real quick:<br/><br/><b>Panic</b>: THINK -1D until you calm the fuck down. (Possibly on a THINK roll, or by being sedated, etc.)<br/><b>Worse Panic</b>: (for suffering Panic twice before calming the fuck down) run away screaming until you calm the fuck down<br/><b>Worst Panic</b>: (suffering Panic three times before calming the fuck down) stand inactive, paralyzed by your panic, until you calm the fuck down                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207990/#Comment_207990" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T13:23:09+00:00" title="May 18, 2009  1:23PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For effects like that...<br/>\n<br/>\nHesitation, Catatonia, Rage, Hallucination, Phobias                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207992/#Comment_207992" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T13:31:00+00:00" title="May 18, 2009  1:31PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, here's the way death works:<br>Certain injuries are described as "Fatal."

To get to the point where your guy is totally cracked mentally, and getting the crazy dangerous effects I mentioned in the first post, we need to establish certain mental shocks as the mental equivalent of a fatal wound and/or a mortal wound. "Fatal" mental shocks should be extremely rare (and, of course, legitimately avoidable in-play), probably limited to things like watching Cthulhu take a dump.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207994/#Comment_207994" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-18T13:36:38+00:00" title="May 18, 2009  1:36PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...and let's try coming at this from the other direction, which I think will be easier:<br/><br/>WHAT MENTAL EFFECT OCCURS WHEN...<br/><br/>...you see someone die a sudden or gruesome death?

In fact, I think you wrote it up exactly right two posts up.  Presumably there's some mental equivalent of ENDURE, and failing the WILL roll against an UNSPEAKABLE  thing sticks you with a temporary insanity (imposing whatever the equivalent of a -2 gave-up-the-high-ground penalty is in your system), whereas failing against YE LIVELIEST AWFULNESS  splatters your mind all over the place and makes you unplayable, just as if you were dead.  So what you want here is just to convene a usage panel, yeah?  "Is seeing Cthulhu take a dump UNSPEAKABLE or YE LIVELIEST AWFULNESS?  How about seeing Cthulhu taking a dump, backwards?"<br><br>Aside: Ralph, some other time, if you'd like, I'd love to sell you on how the CoC Sanity mechanic is much more than a countdown - it's an elegant part of the system, it's a resource with Baker-ish escalation implications (will you risk 0/1 for your goals? 1/1d6? 1d10/1d100?), it's a pacing mechanic, it takes into account the size of chunks you lose, it ties that into the temp/indef insanity system, and it can even be used with a printed optional rule to represent hardening.  But part of its elegance is that in CoC, SAN works kind of like HP and kind of like a skill, and that doesn't necessarily apply here.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208122/#Comment_208122" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-19T10:32:41+00:00" title="May 19, 2009 10:32AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The tiers were just something I happened to think of at the time.

Basically a second track of "mental wounds" that are generated by shocks and horrors just like physical wounds are generated by blunt trauma and sharp, pointy objects. And as for the shocks and horrors:<br/>...you see someone die a sudden or gruesome death? - Anything from disgust to nausea to PTSD. I've seen a guy bleed his brains out of his ears, and it didn't paralyze me but it definitely brought on some sobbing later and bad dreams. And, as with CoC, it probably diminishes with repetition: my aunt is an ER nurse, and I doubt she freaks out from ANYTHING less than a baby carrying its own dismembered foot with a heroin needle broken off in its arm.<br/>.....What if he's your buddy? - The above plus anything from sadness to extreme depression. Which reminds me that someone's relative "callousness" could seriously skew any "static" scale of mental trauma: a hard bastard might laugh at another person dieing, while a loving person would be far more traumatized. Perhaps you need another stat, similar to Willpower, or even something like an alignment system?<br/>.....What if you did it to him? - The above PLUS extremities of guilt, I'd imagine. Could lead to hallucinations ("No, Bob's not dead; he's standing RIGHT BESIDE ME!")<br/>...you cannibalize a person? - Self-loathing, disgust, possible eating disorders down the road. Possible eventual psychosis or dissociative disorder.<br/>.....What if he's your buddy? - Above times about ten.<br/>...you stumble across a gruesome corpse and, like, accidentally put your hand in a puddle of goo that was recently his face? - Probably a lesser "eww" factor than watching someone die violently before your eyes. Possible development of cleanliness obsessions (OCD; Lady MacBeth Syndrome).<br/>.....What if he's your buddy? - Above plus sadness and so forth. This "buddy" thing is important, eh?<br/>...you go really long without light? - Nyctophobia.<br/>...you go really long without sleep? - Plenty of research on this--Google it.<br/>...you hear strange noises? - What-The-Fuck?-Phobia. Overactive imagination. Probably the most minor trauma so far, I'd suspect. Foreboding, maybe? Heebie-jeebies?<br/>...you hear unearthly noises? - See above. Though I wonder just what an "unearthly noise" is, come to think of it. Mystified, probably? ("What the fuck was THAT noise?" "A washing machine overflowing Jell-O, I think.")<br/>...you hear noises that are absolutely monstrous? - Aversion to terror: run screaming or stand and drool (hey, good point: have you read about Steel in Burning Wheel?).<br/>...you see a monster? - First time: shit pants, fight or flight. Tenth time: analysis and cunning pleasure of the hunt.<br/>...you witness a mutilation? - I'd say about the same as seeing a violent death, but prolonged and therefore more likely to really "stick in."<br/>.....What if the victim is your buddy? - Ditto, plus sadness or depression. Or extreme anger at the perpetrator (animate or not).<br/>.....you get mutilated yourself? - Horror waning down to self-pity (or self-loathing, if one feels "diminished" by or responsible for the mutilation). Rage against perpetrator.<br/><br/>But I don't dig the approach, in general: there's WAY too many possible discrete events. Better if you approach them in some categorical, combinatorial, multi-axial manner, I think:<ul>\n<li>Destruction (severe wounds, torture, death, desecration) - Fear and loathing; disgust; sorrow; rage (VERY situational, actually, as I think about it)<br/></li><li>Effluvia (blood, ichor, fecal matter, phlegm, mucus, ejecta) - Sliding scale of disgust and PTSD<br/></li><li>Bonds (filial, familial, romantic, fraternal, friendship, amicable, stranger, rival, enemy) - Sliding scale of extreme sadness -&gt; wicked glee (schadenfreude), depression, and guilt (even if you didn't do it--survivor's guilt)<br/></li><li>Uncanniness (unnatural, disturbing, freakish, horrifying) - Anything from fear to aggression to disgusted fascination<br/></li><li>Deprivation (sustenance, warmth, rest, light, comforts) - Anything from hallucinations to catatonia to murderous desperation or despair<br/></li><li>Culpability - Sliding scale of guilt and depression, factored by degree of control you had over your (re)actions</li></ul>\nThen you can sort of "design" mental traumas as values on each scale of the above categories, with resultant combined/amplified mental debilitation. Just as a severe compound fracture of an arm will not only start to kill you but also make the arm useless; a freakish monster eating your friend's guts out while he still lives would combine high Uncanniness, Destruction, Effluvia, and Bonds into a cocktail of terror, rage, disgust, traumatic stress, and guilt.<br/>(cont)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_208751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208751/#Comment_208751" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-22T14:37:44+00:00" title="May 22, 2009  2:37PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm... and the higher the initial combined trauma, the longer-lasting its effects--with or without treatment--I should think.

Stimuli lead to discrete symptoms, which <i>in toto</i> define a disorder, right? Stimuli gives you the signal to test for mental trauma; symptoms emerge, adjust by the victim's mental toughness, experience, empathy, and other factors (some of my categories above); and the disorder bubbles out from the set of symptoms which the victim suffers, post-test(s).<br/><br/>Yeah... you got some reading to do, I think. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> Or just run with the ideas that came of my armchair psychology above.<br/>(fin)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_208805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/208805/#Comment_208805" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-23T09:34:54+00:00" title="May 23, 2009  9:34AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man.
