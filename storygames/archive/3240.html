Successes would move you closer to or farther away from your opponent using range bands (i.e. close, medium, long, extreme, etc).  And these same range bands were used for combat ranges.  You could also try maneuvers like 'double-back' and 'quick-turn', and the GM could throw obstacles like "railroad crossing" in your way.  But I would always go for the 'oil-slick' switch on the center console:)<br/><br/>I bet it would work pretty well with spaceships.<br/><br/>I also remember Burning Sands: Jihad (SF supplement for Burning Wheel) having some good chase rules.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73585/#Comment_73585" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T10:55:12+00:00" title="June  4, 2007 10:55AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess part of the question would be "what makes chases exciting anyway?"<br/><br/>Chases in movies are pretty much unlike chases in the real world, and so you'd probably have to look at what kind of chase you're trying to include, and what the goals are as far as the feel you're hoping for.<br/><br/>How would an ideal chase scene play out?

SC 2.0's chase rules (and all the dramatic conflict rules, really) are a good go-to if d20 is the game you're playing. Otherwise, the basic SotC chase and dogfight concepts are probably adaptable to other systems pretty easily. You're essentially pitting participants against each other via opposed rolls, with the loser of a given exchange taking some consequences, e.g., damage to their ship or person.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73609/#Comment_73609" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T12:38:03+00:00" title="June  4, 2007 12:38PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damage to ship or person isn't the only possible consequence of losing a roll, either.

I would say tops has to be tension, but second would probably be the ability of the players to make decisions that mattered and also somehow produced more tension.<br/><br/>The antithesis would be the last horse/wagon chase I ran in Savage Worlds.  And I'll freely admit that while I've played tons of SW, the chase rules have only come up a few times.  But basically, the chase rules use 1 playing card per vehicle to represent both initiative and relative position.  And the cards are re-dealt at the start of the next round.<br/>After about 3 rounds of random position changes without the players maneuvering seeming to affect their positioning, the play bogs down, players loose interest.  Uniteresting.<br/><br/>I just now read the SotC wiki rules on dogfights and I like them, and I'll track down a friends copy of Spycraft and see what it has to say on the subject.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73618/#Comment_73618" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-04T13:02:32+00:00" title="June  4, 2007  1:02PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a Fight In The Sky hack for Rissus that would make for very cool dogfights.
