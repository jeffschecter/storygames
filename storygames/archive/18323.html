I've had lots of experience with mechanics like this in my games and I can scream out "Don't do it!"<br/><br/>Terminology I've used is Yes And, Yes But and No Actually. It comes out to the same thing. When people can just shut down another player's action it means the game is competitive. Not much call for that in story games. It involves players killing one another's energy which does not help story.<br/><br/>Foolishly I pursued this goal for over 15 years with Matrix games. So much creativity shut down. So little story advanced. So few people wanting to play the game...<br/><br/>Now I'm playing with a system that involves one player making an action, that if it goes unchallenged, happens - no roll needed. If some one challenges it there is a die roll. If the challenger wins their action happens (since the usually build on the first action this doesn't shut down the story. If the first player wins then they may choose to say the challenge doesn't happen but if they don't actively step up and say this, both actions happen. The roll is about who gets the choice of veto or not. This seems to be working well so far. This is what Fairy Tale Assassin League uses.<br/><br/>Another issue to consider is the logic of who goes first. If it is only one action versus one action then there is no problem but what if two or more players jump in to challenge? A game could use a traffic cop to say who goes first, second etc. I'm using that approach now. Or the rules could set down mechanics for multiple players to roll at the same time. I used to do that. It can work but I gave it up when I realized that no one lese was doing it and people were having a hard time figuring out what I was saying. It can lead to way too many whiffs. One on one challenges is the easiest to explain.<br/><br/>Hope this helped!<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MrPurple" title="MrPurple"><img alt="MrPurple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MrPurple">MrPurple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413227/#Comment_413227" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-30T17:35:09+00:00" title="April 30, 2013  5:35PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 30, 2013 5:38PM by MrPurple.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The reason why yes and no results are uneven, to my mind, is that a no results leaves the players where they started, with no change in circumstances to before the roll, in contrast a yes result leaves the players with something new, a new situation, a new intent to accomplish.<br/><br/>I agree that "no, because" is an interesting addition although it could be best rolled into "no, but" for cases where a positive side effect is hard to justify, also I think "no, and" has it's place to underline the risk of certain actions. Would a "yes, because" be as interesting? I aren't sure, it may feel like deus ex machina if used badly, but I can see some interesting situations.<br/><br/>An either-way partial seems a little weak once a straight "no" has been removed, and some reasons for a roll leave little leeway for a partial success, plus the feeling that there was little point rolling if you just decide.<br/><br/>I wrote a system called "d20 of terror", which I haven't got to test yet, the players had a table of results and the cut-off points of the various categories changed during play.

In one of my games, the players takes care of the description if they succeed on a roll and the GM takes care of the description when they fail. It's the other way around when it comes to opponents in combat: GM describes the successful rolls and the players the failed rolls.<br/><br/>All successful rolls are a "Yes, because", where the player describes why the action is successful, usually by including something in the description. It can be a skill, a banana or whatever. "So you're trying to damage your opponent using a banana? Do you succeed?" - "Yes, because..."<br/><br/>You can also include "Yes, and" (the player add something else that is positive) or "Yes, but" (the GM adds something else that is negative). In my game, a very good roll is a "Yes, and you are totally awesome while doing it. Now describe how awesome you are" while a marginal success is a "Yes, but the GM will come up with something that hinders you, so in the next turn you must include how you overcome that problem". It doesn't have to be combat related. Imagine the use of "Yes, but" while playing out a chase scene or just if you want to lockpick a door. In the latter example, all you need to do is respond verbally (not mechanically) to the GM's addition.<br/><br/><b>No, because</b> could also be described as asking  "Why do you fail?". The answer should create a new situation. Perhaps you manage to open the door but some guards arrive, the door is wired to an alarm, perhaps it's a dead end, or all three? One way of creating new situations is to think outside the PC and the task and try to include a third component. It can be adding a creature, an object or a fact that is the next issue to overcome.<br/><br/>As you can tell, the use of "No, because" will make the players succeed in the end. They will end up in more and more situations but they will finally succeed with a roll and overcome everything. The thing is what it costed. Is the alarmed triggered and the guards murdered? Was this a simple smash 'n' grab turned into something more serious? But I don't think the cost is the most important thing to why you should use it. It's more important that the "no" doesn't block the player and instead creates a <i>communication </i>between the players and the GM (or the participants if GM-less). A communication that doesn't end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Badgers" title="Badgers"><img alt="Badgers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Badgers">Badgers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413251/#Comment_413251" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-01T04:53:08+00:00" title="May  1, 2013  4:53AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love "No, because".

It empowers the GM massively, which we know can work but does it lead to the most creative story telling or does it lead to trying to guess what the GM is thinking of rather than creating the story you are jazzed to make? If everyone can say "no because" that evens this out. "No because adds to the story as much as saying yes, just with limits. With everyone doing this it is like an ever changing maze where passages open and close.<br/><br/>I think both the GM driven game and the ever changing maze could be fun. I can see a limit in using the mechanic though if it shuts down creativity too much.

It's often implicit, but that means that some people forget about it, don't even care to provide it, or haven't learned how to use it.  It's better to be clear about how the communication works.<br/><br/>"...because"  gives something to the player to play with. "No, you can't pass that door because guards arrive" or "No, you can't give that bribe because it's against her religion" gives so much more than the simple "No, you fail". It's soo easy to stare at the result and say "No, you fail" instead of describing why the roll is failing.<br/><br/>I think this works excellent in combat as well. Let say that an agile elf with throwing stars is fighting a troll that's using a log to fight with. They attack each other every second time and the first four blows miss. The defender describes the failed attack rolls, and how should the descriptions sound like if the defender started with "No, because..."?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413365/#Comment_413365" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-02T05:07:41+00:00" title="May  2, 2013  5:07AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When you get into "because" isn't this turning an action more into an argument? <br/><br/>Action + Result + Three Reasons <br/><br/>Assumes that you are trying to convince someone, which suggests that if they are not convinced that your action might not happen in the first place.

This is Vincent's classic "Moves Snowball.")<br/><br/>Yes but...(Your success comes at a cost, or creates additional problems for you)<br/><br/>Yes and (You gain access to a new opportunity that you wouldn't normally have had access to.) <br/><br/>Now I know that eliminating "No but" from the series of possible results might seem a little extreme, but hear me out. In most circumstances, a No-But result is going to look very much like a "Yes but" result in play, with the exception that the character didn't accomplish their goal. Most of the time in my experience, the "consolation prizes" that get doled out to players and their characters who face a "No-But result" are deeply unsatisfying and don't really create anything new. It either gets treated as "a success but less so" (which brings up the problem of whiffing) or gives the player a goal or something they don't really want, which is pointless as a reward. <br/><br/>So what we're left with is basically AWs and assorted hacks method of doing things. Which is awesome, but since we're trying to build a new resolution system here lets figure out a way to expand it. I got the sense that part of what you're looking for Murgh is a wide range of possible results from a role, all of which move the "story" forward in some way by creating new challenges or opportunities for players. Going in that direction I come up with: <br/><br/>No and+ (You didn't get what you wanted. You now have to deal with a difficult situation and an immediate consequence)<br/>No and (You didn't get what you wanted. You now have to deal with a difficult situation or immediate consequence<br/>Yes but (You got what you wanted, but you have to deal with an immediate consequence or difficult situation). <br/>Yes and (You got what you wanted, and you get an immediate benefit or a new opportunity)<br/>Yes and+ (You got what you wanted, and you get an immediate benefit and a new opportunity). <br/><br/>This schema works similarly to how Advanced Moves play out in AW, but going both ways (successes and failures). Here's an example of how it would play out, using a cliche dungeon-crawling situation: picking the locked (and possibly trapped) door to a dungeon:<br/><br/>I try to pick the lock and....<br/><br/>Roll really low: I don't get the door open. The spirit inhabiting the door curses my line with an ancient doom while it begins wailing "INTRUDERS!! It won't be long before the guardians of the crypt awaken. <br/><br/>Roll low: I don't get the door open. The door I entered through slams shut and sand begins to pour into the room. If I don't get out of here soon I'll suffocate. <br/><br/>Just barely got it: I get the door open, but I've got to make a blood offering to the spirit, leaving me weak and drained. Hopefully there's no dragon at the end of this dungeon. Depending on the GM's read of the situation, they might of preferred a difficult situation rather than immediate consequence, based on what would affect my character the most and produce the most interesting results.<br/><br/>Got it: I get the door open with nary a squeak, taking the goblins in the next room off guard. <br/><br/>Breezed Through It: I get the door open with nary a squeak. I take the goblins in the next room off guard, and manage to wrest knowledge of an opening spell from the door's guardian spirit. <br/><br/>Just an idea. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413730/#Comment_413730" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-08T06:23:53+00:00" title="May  8, 2013  6:23AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2013 6:25AM by Rickard.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Now I know that eliminating "No but" from the series of possible results might seem a little extreme, but hear me out.

If we look at the outcome as positive and negative, it seems like the same thing if you got (yes, but) positive+negative and (no, but) negative+positive. So it's pretty much what you say: it's two sides of the same thing. Sure, "no, but" makes you fail your task but the "yes, but" can instead make you fail another task (leading to another situation). So all in all, it gives the same effect.<br/><br/>I've always been annoyed with having and/but on both sides of fail/succeed, and here is another reason why.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413829/#Comment_413829" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-09T11:18:22+00:00" title="May  9, 2013 11:18AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really love Archipelago and Itras By, and made a set of custom d6s with those results.
