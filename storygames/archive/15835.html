First is the scenario we are playing. It is a re-write of the first prequel cos I didn't like what was in the theater.<br/><br/>All the action of this game takes place on Tatooine. The gist of this movie is to introduce characters, like Anakin Skywalker, and to introduce the villan \u2013 the clones. In this story the future Emperor is a good guy, Anakin is a good guy, heck! everyone is a good guy. The purpose of the movie is to get you to like these guys so you will feel bad when things go cockeyed.<br/><br/>The characters are (in order of appearance):<br/><br/>Lord Palpatine: A Jedi politician. Commander of the mission.<br/><br/>Queen Padme: Politician, young unmarried woman, very important. This is her mission.<br/><br/>Obe Wan Kenobi: A young Jedi. Loyal follower of Palpatine.<br/><br/>A mysterious cloaked bad guy: You will learn later in the movie that he is a clone and that clone are evil\u2026<br/><br/>Anakin Skywalker: A hot shot farm boy.<br/><br/>Owen Skywalker: A not hot shot farm boy.<br/><br/>Sand Raiders: Bad guys<br/><br/>Jawas: Plot device guys<br/><br/>Sneaky Bartender: Plot device guy<br/><br/>Old Republic Storm Troopers: Bad guys because they are replacement clones!<br/><br/>The story starts on board a space ship entering the the Tatooine star system. Palpatine and Padme are on the observation deck. Obe Wan will enter the scene with a message of a strange ship behind them.<br/><br/>The scenes<br/><br/>On the observation deck<br/><br/>\u201cWe\u2019re under attack!\u201d Introduce cloaked villan.<br/><br/>Crash landing: Introduce Anakin and Owen who see it happen<br/><br/>To the rescue! Farm boys go to help. Sand Raiders introudce first fight.<br/><br/>We need your help. First meeting of Padme and Anakin.<br/><br/>There is a plot afoot. Who can you trust?<br/><br/>Jawa transport. Time for Anakin to talk to Obe Wan.<br/><br/>Intrigue in Mos Eisley. Cloaked figure gains control of the local storm troopers.<br/><br/>The bar scene. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bad feeling about this\u2026\u201d<br/><br/>Running street battle<br/><br/>Capture a ship.<br/><br/>Clone troopers are defeated. The enemy is revealed.<br/><br/>Anakin decides to run off with Obe Wan to become a Jedi.<br/><br/>End credits\u2026                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359792/#Comment_359792" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-15T10:49:42+00:00" title="February 15, 2012 10:49AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The next part is how this EMG works (there are actually many different Matrix games of varying complexity - this one is the simplest).<br/><br/>The way this game works is that one player starts a scene by making up a little of what happens next. The other players may accept this (in which case it happens without a roll) or challenge it and say what happens instead. Everyone may challenge an openning action and may ask the host if they can challenge a challenge. The two players roll 2d6 and the high roller wins. The losers action will get a line drawn through it. Players add or challenge action by making a comment on this thread. If you challenge then roll the dice for both players to find out who wins. We will trust one another to play fair with the dice. Once a turn is resolved another player can jump in with the next beginning action. This builds on the scene. The host will say when we move on to the next scene. The scene are pre-laid out so don\u2019t go trying to change that!<br/><br/>I will open a new blog post for each scene. All you have to do to play is to jump in.<br/><br/>I will take this game slowly so I don\u2019t expect to get through a scene in a day. It may take a couple of days per scene. Enjoy the creative part. Take it slow. Make it fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359793/#Comment_359793" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-15T10:52:28+00:00" title="February 15, 2012 10:52AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We are now a day into the game and the first scene is about done.<br/><br/>Lord Palpatine and Padme are on the observation deck of a star ship. They are on a mission for the Old Republic. Lord Palpatine is the commander of the mission but it is Padme\u2019s mission. This is the openning of the movie and they are talking about what is going on. At some point the Young Obe Wan Kenobie will join them with news about a ship to their rear.<br/><br/>Remember! In this story Palpatine is a good guy! Don\u2019t foreshadow is eventual evil in this movie. We need to learn to like this guy first.<br/><br/>You may now start making this scene happen.<br/>This entry was posted in Uncategorized by Chris Engle. Bookmark the permalink.

I think it should be Commonwealth, not Skywalker. (Reason being, it\u2019s too much of a coincidence, in my opinion, that the ship would have the same name as one of the protagonists). I rolled an 8 for myself, and a 7 for Dr Rotwang!.
