Others are of course more than welcome to chime in too.<br/><br/>First, I'm not entirely clear about the definition of advocacy, but I assume it's something like this: A player advocates for his character by making mechanical and "roleplaying" choices that benefit the character from the character's own perspective.<br/><br/>Is this about right? The "from the character's own perspective" part seems important -- you're not advocating by making decisions that are "good" for the character in some objective way (whatever that means) or from the perspective of the *player*, but from the perspective of the character (who could have messed up values and motivations). Right?<br/><br/>My other question is, in the light of the advocacy role, how do you view mechanics such as the following:<br/><br/>FATE system: The GM can "compel" characters to act in ways that are somehow disadvantageous by giving the player a fate point.<br/>Burning Wheel: The player can choose to act in a "somehow disadvantageous" way by getting into trouble because of an Instinct, and get a fate point for it.<br/><br/>I find that often, from a purely mechanical point of view, the tradeoff (point vs disadvantage) is not "worth it", but players do it anyway because it's fun to display some flaw of character. However, as an "advocate" for my character, how should I think about this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267129/#Comment_267129" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T12:03:49+00:00" title="April 14, 2010 12:03PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We had a good previous discussion about this in the context of comedy <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10303&amp;Focus=229303#Comment_229303" rel="nofollow">starting here.</a> (Rest of the thread is good too.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267140/#Comment_267140" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T12:33:10+00:00" title="April 14, 2010 12:33PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's "character advocacy", not "player advocacy". It's the character you advocate for, not the player <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> I also should say before we start: I think I got the term "character advocacy" from Mike Holmes years ago, but lately I've been the only one developing it by that name. The concept behind the term is pretty straightforward, though, and insofar as I understand rpg theory it's largely assumed by most of what Vincent Baker does, for instance. I just throw that term around because the issues outlined in that blog post fascinate me - for example, what the player responsibilities in games that <i>don't</i> use character advocacy actually are; this is an interesting question because advocacy is key to almost all narrativistic games, and I already understand those games upright, downright and sideways. So I need a name for the actual function a player provides by "playing his character" that differentiates advocacy from what other types of games ask of a player.<br/><br/>The technical definition I use in f.ex. <i>Solar System</i> (that booklet's really half rpg theory) is that character advocacy requires the player to choose "how the character would act" in situations of choice, and it requires him to express the character's choices and thinking behind them powerfully for the benefit of the other players. (These elements are inexcricably intertwined because you can't depict choices unless somebody makes them, and it doesn't matter if you make choices unless you make them known to the other players.) I rather like the term "advocacy" here, because that's effectively what the player is doing: he's arguing his character's humanity and protagonism to the rest of the group, defending him against an ignomity. (Parallels to how bad PCs in Zombie Cinema get eaten are not accidental.)<br/><br/>You're right in that advocacy happens from the character's own viewpoint, to express the character's own choices. A best interest has no particular bearing on this: an advocate will cheerfully have a character drink himself to death if that's what it takes to express the character's true nature to the group and himself. What traditional terminology would call "using OOC knowledge" is explicitly against the principle of advocation because it assumes that the player has some external interest in the character's fate when he actually should only be concerned with delivering his character strongly for the benefit of the audience (including himself). An advocate will make the right choice because breaking his character's integrity as a character just to have them act for a greater good would ultimately undermine the player's long-term task of crafting a memorable and dramatically powerful character: as writers know, you can't have a compelling character if your choices for him are always inconsistent spot-calls for whatever virtue du jour you happen to have at hand; consistency is more important for advocacy than being right.<br/><br/>Although I do not think that FATE should necessarily be played from an advocacy viewpoint (jury's still out on that - I should play and think about it more), the specific game mechanic of compels is not a problem for advocacy; rather the opposite, in fact. If a character is alcoholic in FATE and gets compelled to drink himself to death, then that's an aid for the player in expressing the character's true nature, not a hindrance. The player does not have to make every choice for a character for the advocation to be effective; he just needs to be able to make sure that the character's true nature is depicted via his choices. In the specific case of FATE compels one might argue that if a player doesn't want to have his character compelled, he shouldn't take those aspects, because taking an aspect means an honest claim to a specific character nature. Don't take "Alcoholic" if you don't want the character to die drinking, in other words.<br/><br/>The above goes for Burning Wheel as well, and it's definitely an advocacy game. I really view these mechanics more as dramatic balancing measures (to make sure characters who get kicked in the head bounce back, for example) and bribes that attract players who aren't feeling their character more than as messing with player autonomy. The practice of giving out perks for playing your character into a disadvantageous position can be viewed as a practical way of directing players to do advocacy in a culture that is often hung up on winning challenges. It's easier to make a genuine choice for or against death by drinking if you know that you're getting some benefit for taking the traditionally "wrong" choice. Solar System does this, too: if a player feels like he should be bribed to play his character's disadvantage, he's free to take a Key that does so.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, I think that viewing xp points, fate points and other such stuff as rewards is a shallow Pavlovian view of what we're doing in a roleplaying game, and ultimately not the deepest truth; I can't name a single game where considering xp as a reward is actually a healthy attitude when reflected against the game's actual purpose. The best games have other, deeper reasons for giving out the "rewards" and it just looks like we're hunting a reward. For example, Solar System is like this: it looks like players are hunting after xp because they get phat lootz for their characters that way, but in fact the xp is not there for the phat lootz, it's for the purposes of determining character identity: the choices you make in expending the xp change who the character is, and the rate at which you gain xp helps the group in pacing this growth and change. So even if you take the player and his presumed xp-fueled antics out of the picture we still need to have the characters gain xp and spend it for the game to follow through on its job as a heroic growth epic.<br/><br/>The short methodical answer to your second question is that as the advocate of your character you make the choice that makes the image of the character as a compelling protagonist more powerful. The fact that you want to get the fate point might make you question which is the correct choice for this character, but that's only good; if you can justify taking the fate point without breaking the character, then the game mechanic has done one of its jobs by making you question who your character really is. This only becames a problem if you're not feeling your character, perhaps because you don't care to advocate for him. In that case the mechanical reward becomes an empty number on a character sheet or an empty chip in your hand, nothing more.<br/><br/>(And just to clarify because there are a lot of FATE players here: if advocation is the thing to do in FATE, on which I'm not certain, then at least I'm pretty sure that the advocation in FATE is predicated on a static character identity. This is a big deal in that you have something of a duty to not reinvent the character half-way through. The job is to express who the character is more than choose who he is, I might say: more about the expression part of the advocacy equation than the choice part.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elenius" title="elenius"><img alt="elenius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elenius">elenius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267148/#Comment_267148" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T13:03:36+00:00" title="April 14, 2010  1:03PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see.<br/><br/>I was making (in my head, mostly) a distinction between a character's <i>motivations</i> and his <i>flaws</i>, and thinking that advocating for a character involved advocating for his motivations, while being confused about where the flaws came in. For example, a character might have a motivation of love for X, where he tries to make X love him back etc, and as an advocate for the character I am trying to make that happen. At the same time, he might have the flaw Alcoholic, which makes it harder to achieve the goal of love, and thus being something an "advocate" wouldn't bring up (although the "devil's advocate" would, this could be the GM with his compels...). <br/><br/>From what you're saying, I take it this is wrong, and your point about "why would a player choose a flaw if he doesn't want it to come up" is well taken. <br/><br/>I hadn't considered Keys as flaws (only as motivations). It is interesting that the two are combined into one mechanic in SS.<br/><br/>I have to say, to me the word "advocate" does not have quite the connotations that you give it. Your description sounds more like "portrayal". You're "showing off" your character as he is to yourself and the other players. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/advocate" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thefreedictionary.com/advocate</a> defines "advocate" as: "To speak, plead, or argue in favor of"<br/><br/>If your character is a drunken jerk, and your job as a player is to show him off as a drunken jerk, is that really "arguing in favor of" the character?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267149/#Comment_267149" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T13:24:32+00:00" title="April 14, 2010  1:24PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Portrayal" is a fair term, I don't mind it. "Advocation" is punchy and it's just what I happened to pick when I started to develop the concept, but it's largely arbitrary. Feel free to use another term if you'd like. The reason for why the word works for me is that I'm viewing the player's task as advocating for his character's protagonism, not as advocating for his place in Heaven: the job is to display the character's nature as worthy of our sympathy and attention, not to lionize the character uncritically. For this reason the advocate does not try to get rid of a character's flaws; the flaws are part of his tools in advocating the character as a viable and interesting protagonist, not an enemy to be eliminated - the latter attitude just results in aloof loner characters who are never wrong and never human, and never interesting, either. You might appreciate the term "advocation" better if you imagine the group of players as a bunch of judges who are decising on an issue: is this character worthy of our continuing attention as a protagonist? Failure in character advocation, the most important task of the player in many games, results in a failure of drama on account of non-existing protagonism.<br/><br/>It's important for advocation as a practice that while we as audience might consider some features of a character his identity and others as his flaws, the advocate can't prejudge the character in this way. The closest we can come is by externalizing some character aspects as flaws, but in that case we're just redefining the character's identity and saying that some things are not part of him: instead of this singular character who happens to be alcoholic we have a fine guy who's plagued by the flaw of alcoholism. Both are viable characters for drama, but the portrayal differs: in one case the advocate displays the character struggling against the alien trait of alcoholism, while in the other case he shows the character struggling to get by with the rest of the world despite his alcoholism. Both types of characters have been used with success in drama. In the latter case alcoholism will only be branded a flaw (or a serious flaw, whatever) in retrospect: the advocate first shows us what the character is like, and after the story we can say that it was his alcoholism that was his downfall. Before that point the alcoholism is not a "flaw", it's just one part of an entire character to be depicted. The same goes for being a "nerd" - the player likely won't want to make being a nerd into an external flaw, he'd rather depict the nerd character and let the story show us the benefits and drawbacks of being one.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>The question of whether you can build a game in which the advocate never has to own up to any flaws in the character he's portraying is interesting. How would the advocate prevent the other players from condemning a choice the character makes? You can of course write the character sheet full of virtues, but if the player is actually advocating (making choices and depicting them), then what happens when the player makes the inevitable mistake and has the character fall down on one of his virtues? D&amp;D paladins can be interpreted like this if you decide to play D&amp;D with character advocacy, it seems; perhaps the advocate needs to consult with the other players in advance on whether some choice would break alignment, thus ensuring that the character really never has any flaws?<br/><br/>Then there is play in which the player is concernedly trying to make the character the best he can be according to the player's own opinion. That doesn't really change the advocation, it just changes the method the player uses in creating the character he's going to advocate. I could easily imagine a game, perhaps religiously themed, in which the players each create characters who are "pure light beings", perhaps gnostic spirits or some such, who are then weighted down by externally imposed flaws. The characters have to then struggle with their flaws (flaws such as "having a material body") and make choices worthy of flawless beings; sounds perfectly playable at first glance, although the premise is misleading in that the real meat of the game would likely be in finding out how very flawed even a "perfect light being" can be.<br/><br/>In most games, though, the premise is that our protagonists are vulnerable, imperfect humans, and this makes them interesting. Advocates who like to only take perfect clients don't seem to keep their clients alive very long in Zombie Cinema, perhaps because the genre is not very kind on Mary Sue characters; you need to have a human nature the other players can sympathise with for the character to be viable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elenius" title="elenius"><img alt="elenius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elenius">elenius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267157/#Comment_267157" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T14:07:35+00:00" title="April 14, 2010  2:07PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, great post (as usual).<br/><br/>Are *mechanical* choices part of advocacy?

In fact, doing it all the time is usually a mark of certain extreme lineages in design and play; Nordic immersionism, for example - I've encountered immersionists texts that sort of seem like they might be about advocacy, but they insist that you do it all the time without a break.<br/><br/>It is much more typical for a game to have both advocacy and non-advocacy portions. A simple example is narration-sharing in games like Dust Devils or Mountain Witch or PTA: you're not supposed to be advocating when you narrate a conflict resolution, as your task is to draw out the interesting features of the scene and the immediate consequences of the action to your best ability. This is not being done if you only focus on developing your own character. I wrote <i>Zombie Cinema</i> to be explicit in this regard: sometimes the text directs the player to make a creative choice, other times it directs him to advocate for his character. (Of course I don't expect people to pick up on that sort of nuance - in practice they'll figure it out themselves because there really aren't that many ways for a simple game like that to function at all.)<br/><br/>The choice of accepting a compel is really the choice of who your character really is, so it's not a mechanical choice in the final calculation. You're just making a choice, and it just so happens that the different options have different mechanical consequences. This is common in roleplaying games, often choices made by the characters have mechanical consequences for the player in question or others. Some games ride the mechanical thing rather heavily, making the matter of advocacy also a matter of grave pressure from the game mechanics. For example, in Sorcerer you might lose your character if you decide that he's going to summon one more demon. This is all in good fun, the concrete mechanical interactions underline and frame the choices and their consequences, thus increasing the definition of play.<br/><br/>So I'd say that yes, mechanical choices are part of advocacy in the sense that the player usually has all sorts of information about the consequences of the choices he makes for his character, and part of that information is often mechanical in nature. Usually the mechanical consequences are there to depict or symbolize some fictional consequences, in which case there really isn't any important difference: losing your humanity is harsh shit, the mechanic that tracks humanity as a score just underlines that and tells the players when to stop with the attrocities. It's like a label on the otherwise indistinct and vague fictional concept of "humanity". Solar System is full of this shit, it lives and breathes on labeling fictional concepts: by creating a "Secret of Cannibalism" you're creating a touchpoint between the fiction and mechanics where the two coincide and consequently fiction becomes easier to see, framed and underlined by the mechanics; you'll really know that the guy is a cannibal when he's got the <i>Secret of Cannibalism</i> to go along with the fictional conceit.<br/><br/>Game mechanics are of many kinds, though, so I wouldn't try to force any specific relationship on them as regards the practice of advocation. Some mechanics prevent advocation, others facilitate it, others have nothing to do with it... it takes all kinds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267174/#Comment_267174" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-14T14:48:04+00:00" title="April 14, 2010  2:48PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2010 2:49PM by Jesse.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: elenius</cite>I was making (in my head, mostly) a distinction between a character's<i>motivations</i>and his<i>flaws</i>, and thinking that advocating for a character involved advocating for his motivations, while being confused about where the flaws came in.

It's about honestly combining "what the character whats" with "how he would go about it."  For example, your alcoholic who loves someone might very well show up in a drunken stupor in the middle of the night and start crying about, "Have you never notice me?  I send you flowers.  I write you POETRY!  What does it take!  Can't you see how much you mean to me!"<br/><br/>Such play, I find often ends up in uncomfortable areas especially if there's an outcome ridding on a die roll.  For example, my drunk might push his way into the apartment and we might roll to see if he gets her to sleep with him either out of pity or borderline intimidation.  In such cases, I have often see players try to jigger the mechanical odds against themselves or other players immediately try to jigger odds in the favor of the NPC or in really extreme cases simply get the player to retract his action on the purely social level.<br/><br/>I really don't like it when that happens.

I'm sure that a big component of player advocacy groups is stepping up to each others examples of dramatic and memorable character moments. And the constraints under which the groups operate are the believability and consistency of those same characters. Even the language "advocate" describes a battle, even if a legal or a political one. And, of course, "de-clawing" an aggressive well-played move would be a cardinal sin in this style of play. <br/><br/>Does that characterization sound completely bogus? I know that it is not really possible to tap into RPG theories and classifications without connotations and other biases creeping in, but I suspect underneath those there is something useful going on in this case.<br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267253/#Comment_267253" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T07:44:38+00:00" title="April 15, 2010  7:44AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel, <br/><br/>That sounds off base especially since most early Narrativist Forge games are founded on Character Advocacy.

Players are advocating for their characters, not for themselves or each other.<br/><br/>I'm pretty confident that what I'm describing is utterly common in core narrativistic culture - those games that I recognize as master-pieces of narrativism seem to consistently require players to have a specifically advocating relationship to their characters. In comparison, games that fail to deliver powerful narrativism despite superficial attempt seem to often fail exactly because they deviate from advocation - an authorial relationship to characters is common, for example, requiring players to make their characters conform with a predetermined theme and plot "for the good of the story".<br/><br/>There is a similar thing in gamist play as well, but I don't quite know how common it is... we talked about this some time back here, actually: I was telling about how my current favourite form of gamism is challengeful adventure gaming in which a key property of challenge is consensual framing; instead of players constantly fighting back and maneuvering for position in every conseivable way, the players form a common fiction they each promise to take seriously, and the conflict is then played out within the premises of this fiction. From this viewpoint something like a paladin's code of conduct is a self-imposed handicap - the player's goal is not to cheat on the code somehow, but rather prove that he's so badass that he doesn't need poison, ambushes, lying or other such underhanded stratagems to slay the dragon. Ignoring your character's alcoholism when that alcoholism is part of the agreed-upon frame of conflict would make the whole exercise empty; you're effectively cheating by first taking the flaw (and perhaps the character points from it, if the game uses that particular technique) and then ignoring it. It's not the GM's task in this sort of gamism to guard you and make sure that you follow the agreed-upon scheme of things because the player you're cheating first and foremost is yourself: if you didn't want to find out if you're man enough to defeat the terrorists with an old drunk as your character, then <i>what the fuck</i> were you doing agreeing to such a character in the first place? Seems crazy.<br/><br/>Still, is the above the same thing as character advocacy? I don't think so - the idea of advocacy is that you're expressing your character for the benefit of the group, expressing him as a worthwhile protagonist the best you can. The idea of consensual challenge framing, on the other hand, is that you willingly take on handicaps that might have your character act in non-optimal ways because the challenge you're experiencing is exactly the one that involves those flaws. I can't figure out how a pre-worldwar society would survive an attack of Martians if I'm not willing to handicap my character by having him be ignorant of asymmetric warfare theory, germ warfare, equality of women and all the other postmodern ideas that might prove useful in repelling such an assault. So if I'm unable to compartmentalize a bit and have my character act suboptimally in comparison to myself, then I simply can't engage some challenges gaming has to offer. To me this seems like a different set of concerns from the advocacy thing, even if the two might seem similar in that both explain why a player would have his character make a "substandard" choice in comparison to the enlightened, superior vantage of the player himself. Traditional rpg language calls both of these "good roleplaying", and they sort of seem similar, but the reasons behind the similar action are entirely different.<br/><br/>Finally: even if advocacy and consensual challenge framing are actually the same thing viewed from slightly different perspectives, that doesn't make the technique itself representative of solely gamism or narrativism. Like so many other things we concern ourselves with in roleplaying, character advocacy is not a value proposition or a creative agenda - it's just a technique we might use to grasp at creative goals. It has utility, but no inherent value, even if we have very few tools that might replace it in narrativistic play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267274/#Comment_267274" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-15T08:44:44+00:00" title="April 15, 2010  8:44AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The fact that gamers so easily and consistently confuse/conflate "player" and "character" says volumes.

Under this sort of play style / agenda having a character who is violence prone, alcholic, and love-obsessed isn't a handicap, it is a godsend. Try playing someone who is a quiet herbal tea-drinking, Anne McCaffery and Mercedes Lackey novel addict and present her or his inner workings to the groups at large.<br/><br/>Competition is probably a take it or leave it thing here, compared to challenge. Striving together to do something hard and then acknowledging that along the way, and by example drawing each other forward. <br/><br/>So that's what I'm seeing.<br/><br/>As far as character advocacy in general, I'm suspecting as a technique there is a wide spectrum of application from "defending your character from ignominity" and just doing your job to let others know what your "guy" feels. <br/><br/>So it seems a valid claim that the character advocacy in many narrativist games and in the gamist play that I've seen* differs by degrees. Certainly gamist play focusing on the sheer challenge of character advocacy is cranking up the degree of the technique past due diligence.<br/><br/>  - Mendel<br/><br/>*I can swear I've seen it, although I didn't classify it as such at the time.

Basically, what happens is that, "honest addressing of issues" gives way to "one upping" each other for dramatic punch.  It's almost ironic because the OUTPUT of such a story is actually usually a pretty gripping story (especially when recounted after the fact) but if you were present you can clearly tell that the *social* focus one of competition.  Paul Czege has observed this happen a lot in games that have a Player-to-Player reward system like PtA's fan mail.  Instead of fan mail being awarded for clear and honest play, players start trying to push each others buttons to try and reap fan mail.<br/><br/>So, what you're talking about might be related to that phenomenon.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267426/#Comment_267426" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-16T07:38:17+00:00" title="April 16, 2010  7:38AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mendel, I thought the Big Model viewed social recognition for good play as something that sits across all agenda?

"Advocacy" doesn't wear its intended (by Eero) meaning on its sleeve as much (to me at least).<br/><br/>Here's another question: According to Eero's article (see the OP), advocacy is different from "authorship" -- narration rights cannot be given to players in an "advocacy" type game. Eero, you also said above that Burning Wheel is definitely an advocacy game. What about Wises in Burning Wheel then? For the uninitiated, Wises are skills that allow players to narrate facts about the game world. For example, suppose you're being chased through a city, and you have Sewers-Wise. You could use it to say that there is a sewer grate in this alley here, and we're gonna escape through it. This is a very limited kind of non-GM narration, but it shows (I think) that advocacy and authorship are not mutually exclusive. What is it that makes Wises work (as I think they do)?<br/><br/>Or take Polaris: Is this an advocacy game for the player who's turn it is? (You rotate advocacy and GM type duties). Perhaps this is similar to Zombie Cinema in that players have different roles in different time phases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267460/#Comment_267460" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-16T10:14:05+00:00" title="April 16, 2010 10:14AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, Burning games are all quite self-aware of the transition between stances/advocacy (just to further muddle things).

According to Eero's definition, character advocacy means the latter, but you do it *through* the character's choices, not by narrating things about the game world outside of the character.<br/><br/>Eero's article identifies a problem when you combine advocacy (-for-dramatic-situation) with "narration" because it asks a player to both introduce a conflict and to resolve it.

It's pretty clear (to me, anyway) that the narration rights associated with wises are for the purpose of inventing and justifying the link between the character's knowledge and the current situation. It's a very minor bit of narration, made the player's responsibility solely because he's the one who has the initiative in choosing to use a wise. You might view it as a prerequirement of using the skill: if you can't invent a reason for the wise to be relevant, perhaps you should not use it.<br/><br/>This doesn't really pertain to that complaint of mine about uncontrolled narration sharing, as my problem with the latter comes to fore when players are required to make dramatic choices that undermine their advocacy. This is the case when the character is robbed of real adversity by having the player narrate the character into or out of problems by simply manipulating the fictional situation directly. It's not adversity when it's arbitrarily retooled so the character doesn't have to face it. In this light wises are a completely different thing, one in which the player shows how his character overcomes adversity by being so smart. Having a sewer entrance show up just because a player decides so is completely different from stating that this character is so smart that he knows where an entrance is: the former is arbitrary conflict-avoidance, the latter is a character solving his problems by using his strengths.<br/><br/>The above is totally an application of the Czege principle, just like I note in that blog post.<br/><br/>Also: advocacy is not a game type, it's a technical responsibility. It's like, somebody has to do this thing for us to generate narrativistic play in this way. But that does not mean that that is the only thing the player does or that only this player does it. There is no advocacy game type, unless you just mean games that use this technique - but among those games can easily be titles that use other types of player roles as well. I see no contradiction in a game having a player be advocate at one point and author at another; in fact, I'd argue that games that do distribute conflict narration do exactly this: when you narrate conflict resolution you're authoring, but when you're playing your character you're advocating. The responsibilities are clearly different. Some games, like Sorcerer for example, never require a player to do anything but advocate within a scenario (chargen and advancement are different in Sorcerer), but this doesn't make them qualitatively special compared to a game in which you're advocating just half of the time, like Zombie Cinema. Both games still generate the character protagonism by advocation instead of other means.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elenius" title="elenius"><img alt="elenius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elenius">elenius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267516/#Comment_267516" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-16T13:30:19+00:00" title="April 16, 2010  1:30PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Having a sewer entrance show up just because a player decides so is completely different from stating that this character is so smart that he knows where an entrance is: the former is arbitrary conflict-avoidance, the latter is a character solving his problems by using his strengths.<br/></blockquote>\nBut BW does do the former.

To me it is obvious that using a wise represents something the character knows, and the player's narration just describes us what it is. The existence of the sewer is not arbitrary, it exists because it represents the character's local knowledge, justifying to us how the local knowledge manifests itself in this situation. Solar System works just the same with many Abilities, and that's how I've used them: the player can suggest reasonable ways for the Ability to be pertinent to the situation, and the Ability check itself determines whether that reasonable connection actually exists; fail, and there is no useful local knowledge to use for the moment, but if you succeed, then there is something. This is really no different from the player describing how his character decapitates an orc: the mechanics establish success, the player just interprets how the success comes about in the setting. For the conflict resolution procedure establishing the existence of a sewer and establishing the existence of a successful backchop once the orc leaves his guard down are not different types of description.<br/><br/>Spirit of the Century does practically the same thing with invoking, as you note: the player can "narrate" something, but it's really just filling in some reasonable details about the situation, rather than a narration that resolves anything. The difference between a narration that resolves conflicts, narration that pre-empts conflicts and a narration that just sketches out some conditions of the conflict doesn't make sense a priori, but once you look at it against the basic narrativistic theory, it seems pretty clear to me: the act of narration itself doesn't really have anything for or against effective character advocation per se - the two get into conflict only once you allow the narration to replace the choice-consequence-choice-consequence cycle prominent in these games. Describing some external condition that allows an ability to be effective once we've already rolled the dice and determined that it will be effective doesn't do anything to impose on protagonism.<br/><br/>But anyway, I'll need to get going to a convention.
