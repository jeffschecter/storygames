Here's my <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/jamesbond007/" rel="nofollow"><b>James Bond 007 Pages</b></a>.  That has a review of the basic game and also summaries of the four missions (3-5 sessions each) of the campaign.  I also made a <a href="http://indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=9726.0" rel="nofollow"><b>Forge thread on the campaign start</b></a>, in the Actual Play thread.  There wasn't any particular interest in that post, and I didn't post for later stages of the campaign -- though we had a ton of fun with it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I ran a 007 game once using the classic Victory Games ruleset. It was like 20 years ago so please excuse me for lack of details. I had two players, my brother Jason and my friend Mark, who made up agents and they went on their merry way trying to do agenty things. I think they failed some critical roll and the villain got away and managed to place a bomb on a train and blew up the person they were protecting. Something like that. Anyway, we thought the game sucked. It didn't give us the kind of experience that we wanted.<br/><br/>For us, we wanted to feel like James-fucking-Bond. We wanted to succeed most of the time -- or have clear alternatives when we failed. We wanted to come out of gunfights without a smudge on our clean, pressed suits. Most importantly, we wanted more tools to say, "No, fuck that, this dumb-ass thing doesn't happen." Instead, we were slave to the dice, which said *whiff* "you miss." Sucktastic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>Quick question: were you playing Double-0 rank agents? Because if you play rookie agents, then rather obviously, things will be vastly different from the James Bond source material. Playing Double-0 rank agents, my experience was there was nearly no whiff in the game. For our game, chances to succeed were generally over 100%, and the question was instead over what Quality Rating of success you achieve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I wish I could remember. What do the rules suggest? If they recommended starting low and working up to Double-0, that's what we did. If they say, "Hey, just pick the level at which you want to play," then I have no clue what we did.<br/><br/>Still, I have to ask, why does a Double-0 game have rookie agent PCs in it? Why support that kind of play? Do people buy that game while thinking, "Man, I don't want to play James Bond. I want to play one of those mooks who gets wasted by the villain in the first scene"?<br/><br/>I'll grant that I was a dumb teenager who hadn't much clue about how to run a Bond game. I probably should have jumped right into Double-O's (if I didn't) since, as you say, the game seems to handle them very well.</blockquote>\nIt's a good question.  The game doesn't present Rookie as the default option.  There are three levels: Rookie, Agent, and Double-0 -- and it presents sample PCs for each level and supports all three levels in the character creation and the rest of the book.  However, a number of the modules are supposedly balanced for one Double-0 PC, two Agent PCs, or three Rookie PCs.  I had to beef up the opposition in the module I was using to face three Double-0's.  <br/><br/>So the game deserves some blame for *not* having Double-0 as the default, and the other ranks as optional.   However, I think that also some players suffered from assumptions from other games.  i.e. They came from D&amp;D, and to them it felt like cheating to start at higher than first level even though they wanted to be James Bond and the rules allowed it.  I started with JB007 after Champions which probably helped.  <br/><br/>The module issue is a little tricky.  Balancing for one Double-0 agent is good in the sense of emulating the genre.  After all, that's what the movies have.  There should have been better guidelines for beefing up the opposition like I did, though I can see that it's easier on module writers to just write one module and handle more players by lower rank.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69310/#Comment_69310" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T12:40:56+00:00" title="May 15, 2007 12:40PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I definitely came with assumptions from D&amp;D.

Given the realities of marketing, I can hardly fault them for that.  However, I don't think that means that they should have strived to make the game useless for everything except repeating the movies.  <br/><br/>While I think some criticism is warranted, I feel you are unusually harsh for the game simply giving the option of other character types than Double-0's.

It was indeed touted as a Bond game, and I would say it delivers on that front only if you choose to play Double-0 agents.  A good user interface shouldn't just leave these things in the hands of the user.

Actually, now that I have my copy on hand, it first recommends that you use one of the six pregenerated characters, probably a Double-0.  However, in character creation it says: \n<blockquote>The number of Generation Points you give a player will depend on the rank of the character you allow the player to create.  The number of Generation Points per rank is: <br/><b>RANK</b> <b>GENERATION POINTS</b><br/>Rookie  ......... 3000<br/>Agent .......... 6000<br/>"00" ............. 9000<br/><br/>It is recommended that the first character a player creates be at the rank of Rookie, which will help alleviate the confusion that may arise until he becomes familiar with the rules.</blockquote>\nSo I did mis-state this earlier in the thread.  All three options are there and presented equally on the face of it, but it does recommend Rookie for first-time players.  This is problematic just as Adam said -- since first-time players likely picked up the game with genre emulation in mind.  I had only played the game with fairly experienced role-players (had played a few other RPGs before including AD&amp;D and Champions), so we didn't blink at the rules complexity.  I think my first game was Agent level.  <br/><br/>In retrospect, I think that for newbies that besides the pregenerated characters, a set of templates would be useful to make it easier for players to create a "00".  I do give some breaks to this as a game from 1983, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69496/#Comment_69496" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T23:28:08+00:00" title="May 15, 2007 11:28PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite>All three options are there and presented equally on the face of it, but it does recommend Rookie for first-time players.

If the game's premise is something Big and Cool, and then I'm asked to make a character who is Small and Barely Competent, I always end up feeling pissy and making snide comments about it.  Honestly, I'd rather jump into the deep end and flail around with two dozen options until I figure out how everything works than spend ten sessions in the proverbial wading pool.  Especially if, as with most of our games, we're only likely to be playing 15 or so sessions anyway.<br/><br/>Which, of course, presents its own problems, because I'm pretty sure that having two dozen options <i>would</i> paralyze some of our players completely, ending the game much sooner and leaving no one satisfied.  We desperately need a compromise.  I keep pushing something like using pregenerated low-power characters in a one-shot "introduction" game to get people acquainted with the rules and the setting and the possibilities, and then ditching the pregens and going with more high-powered "Big and Cool" characters...but the additional work involved tends to keep that from happening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69642/#Comment_69642" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T09:41:44+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  9:41AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something about this reminds me of the advice Vincent always gives for people playing Dogs for the first time. Rookie Dogs GMs often want to create Towns with small amounts of trouble going on. Vincent usually tells them, no, dude, crank it all the way up to murder. Don't be subtle.<br/><br/>I think for Bond, you don't want subtle for rookies, either. In this case, subtle means sliding away from the genre emulation and creating characters who can't do things easily. I'd recommend Double-0's for beginners and tell players that the rookies and agents are for NPCs and for more advanced players who want to try something different.<br/><br/>If the trouble with doing that is complex chargen, make chargen simpler. John's right that Bond needs templates or something to make chargen faster. <br/><br/>If the trouble is too many options during play, just have a rookie player option that limits the number of options while still making the characters strong. For instance, instead of getting 20 skills with high to very high values, you get 5 skills with very high values and every other skill defaults to high or something. The complexity dial here is how many skills are not left to a default value. The difficulty dial here is the default skill value.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69644/#Comment_69644" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T09:49:11+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  9:49AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>Which, of course, presents its own problems, because I'm pretty sure that having two dozen options<i>would</i>paralyze some of our players completely, ending the game much sooner and leaving no one satisfied.

As I look back over it, giving fewer points is a cheap-and-easy but not particularly effective way to help first-time players.  Hence my suggestion of templates to simplify character creation, for example.  Another would be presenting limited subsystems at a time, i.e. mini-adventures which use only certain of the rules, like an all-combat mini-adventure and/or a no-combat mini-adventure.  <br/><br/>Still, JB007 does do a lot better than most games to help first-time players, in my opinion.  It has an excellent and readable introduction to role-playing that explains the concepts well.  It starts with pregenerated characters -- all familiar ones from the movies, and also a diverse selection (i.e. 3 men and 3 women of various nationalities).  It's got a good character sheet with necessary charts, including an example one filled out.  It's got a solo adventure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69652/#Comment_69652" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T10:21:26+00:00" title="May 16, 2007 10:21AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Over in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3020&amp;page=2#Item_14" rel="nofollow"><b>"How best to support Sim"</b></a>, Mike Holmes had some comments on JB007 that I thought were appropriate to this thread...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>First, while I think that Genre Sim is relatively rare, as I then say, I think that games like FATE do it well. So it does exist as a newer phenomenon in greater quantity. Put another way, if you like Genre Sim, I think that right not is a good time for you. Systems to support it strongly are appearing.<br/><br/>Also I have been called on that statement, in terms of whether I can back it up, and I should say that this is just my own observation. The point I was trying to make is not that people do not play genre sim (much less should not), but that as a proportion of sim play I think it historically has taken a back seat to the prevalence of more immersion-driven sim. That is, where something like James Bond does not seem to support Genre Sim, that's because it intends to support Immersion Sim.<br/><br/>The border between Genre Sim and Immersion Sim is like where somebody says, "I know that James Bond always gets the bad guys, but without a chance to fail, it doesn't feel like I'm there and in the action." That's stilted, sure, but hopefully you get the idea. That's not to say that Genre Sim can't have a chance to fail. It means that in each of these something different is being cherished at the expense of something else. In Genre, we do more to promote the genre, at the expense of the feeling of "being there," whereas in Immersion sim we sacrifice the story looking like a James Bond story for the feeling that we're "being" James Bond.</blockquote>\nIt doesn't seem to me that Gerard Klug's JB007 RPG is immersive to me.  In my experience, the players are all interested in the ongoing plot, without a lot of delving into character depths.  For us, the characters were iconic -- i.e. Sebastian Hyde, 003, had his signature drink of Bombay Sapphire and tonic, and has a wife and daughter.  Also, many of the mechanics are abstract rather than representational -- like Hero Point spending and the Ease Factor bidding mechanics.  <br/><br/>I would say that JB007 does a lot to support the genre -- it just doesn't do it by guiding play to reproduce the plot formulas of the movies.  Instead, it concentrates on the tropes of the movies, like having thrilling car chases and step-by-step seductions.  Because of how it is structured as a game, the overall plot might not go the same way as a typical movie does, but the game play captures the feel of ongoing action fairly well.  <br/><br/>Obviously, opinions may differ.  But I'd like to hear about the varying experiences with this.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Now, does the whiff factor support immersion sim? Tough question. It's going to come down to whether the people playing think that the level that the factor is at is "realistic." I'm not saying that James Bond is, in fact, well designed to deliver what it intends. Merely that this seems to me to be the goal. It man, in fact, fall short of even that goal.<br/><br/>And is that possibly in part because of the rules also being from an era that assumes some gamism in play (meaning that the system promotes multiple modes, and thus incoherence)? Probably. James Bond, you have to understand, was pretty remarkable for it's time in how it made much of any attempt to model genre. Top Secret, actually, had started down this road with the inclusion of Fame and Fortune Points. That's a very rough beginning. But it's a tiny move from "Gamism Spy Dungeons" to something a tad more like the genre. James Bond was a huge leap forward from that. Tremendous. Just including rules for car chases, for instance, meant that they would occur in spy play (whereas before, as I say, the play was all about traipsing across quadrille rendered maps with rooms with contents descriptions). Rather, some people were doing this stuff despite these systems to be sure. But the systems were trying hard to keep up. Top Secret at least allowed you to have your character behave heroically while he still had points. As opposed to those dungeon crawling cowards who run as soon as they're out of magic missiles.</blockquote>\nHaving run a campaign fairly recently, I think JB007 is still competitive with most games as far as modelling its genre.  i.e. It kicks the ass of the Lord of the Rings RPG (admittedly a low goal).  I consider it competitive with recent genre games like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dead of Night</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spirit of the Century</span>.  <br/><br/>As far as whiff factor, it seems to me to work fairly well for the genre.  Rookies (i.e. Mary Goodnight) will tend to have around 50% chance of success in their good skills for standard tasks; Agents (i.e. Felix Leiter) will have around 100%; and Double-0's (i.e. Bond, Anya Amasova) will have around 150%.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69762">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69762/#Comment_69762" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T13:56:42+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  1:56PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2007 1:58PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "immersion" comments really need to be looked at in the context of the other thread.

In the game in question, that's surely not the sort of agenda being promoted by the game, is it? It allows Bond to die, and for players to go astray in following the clue trail into non-Bond territory, because it wants the player to feel that he's not in control of the plot or anything, but, rather, is Bond.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's just one somewhat spurious example.

That's part of my point that, in fact, I think that actual genre simulation techniques have been long in coming and are still far and few between. Because, in fact, I don't think many people actually want genre sim by Joshua's definition. It's a straw man. That said, I think we're approaching it more now with games like Essoterrorists, which seem to have some very non-immersive rules specifically for emulating mysteries (again, well or poorly done is not the question here).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, lastly it wasn't I who said that the whiff factor seemed off. I was only saying that, if it is, that's irrellevant to whether or not it's genre sim. It could just be poorly executed genre sim.<br/>\n<br/>\nI owned a copy of the game, but cannot remember actually playing it. I liked the stats for the canon characters, and the gun and vehicle porn.

Thus, I don't think it should be labelled as "immersion sim".  <br><br>Based on my reading and experience, I would say that JB007 is trying to evoke an interactive feeling parallel to watching the James Bond movies.

TRoS is an explicit attempt to do D&amp;D right which focuses primarily on realistic combat, Prince Valiant is about emulating Arthurian stories, Dying Earth is about experiencing what it is like to be a Vancian protagonist and Inspectres is intended to emulate Ghostbusters.<br/><br/>It may be canonical, but I think it may also be a touch out of date.<br/><br/>Edit:  Cross posted with Andy, I think of the ones I mentioned TRoS is the only one anyone would still argue for today, and personally I'd argue against that quite strongly (if it came up on rpg.net and I was feeling ornery that day).  He just didn't have the examples back then to draw on that he would today.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka" title="GMSkarka"><img alt="GMSkarka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v385/GMSkarka/tinyadamant.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GMSkarka">GMSkarka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69961/#Comment_69961" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T07:30:01+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  7:30AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron is wrong more often than he is right, I'm afraid.

Josh was saying it's not good Genre Sim because it doesn't do X. I was saying that, if X is genre sim, then James Bond is not genre sim, but something else also sim. That is, it's not bad sim just because it doesn't emulate genre in the way he expects genre sim to emulate genre.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese definitions are tenuous at best. Are you trying to define these sub-forms of sim? Or are you trying to point out what the JB RPG does well?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's more, I'd actually agree that Falkenstein and TROS are pretty "Immersionist Sim" supporting sorts of games. TROS does far more to support feeling the character (or even feeling the character in a fight) than it does to support actual "Conan-like" play. Pretty much the only element that supports the "Conan-like" play is the setting. The extent to which it supports narrativism hinges somewhat on the interpretation of one particular rule (whether Spiritual Attribute dice add to every roll, or only to the pool for a round). Given that it's that close, it's hardly a landslide either way. Certainly I've seen TROS played in every mode.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arminius" title="Arminius"><img alt="Arminius" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/588/nMC0KH12ZK6VM.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arminius">Arminius</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70097/#Comment_70097" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T16:36:27+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  4:36PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, John,<br><br>First, I agree with Mike about genre-supporting Sim being a strawman--all my doubts about GNS aside.<br><br>Second, John, does it really matter, within the GNS context, whether JB007 supports immersion or not?

The point that I disagreed with was that JB007 was immersionist and more specifically that it's aim was to try to get you inside of the head of James Bond.  I'm not interested in the GNS categorization, but the immersionist comment was an attempt at a descriptive label -- one that I felt didn't fit.  <br/><br/>So you're playing a bulldog of an English aristocratic spy at the fanciest hotel in Tokyo, and you're about to bag an ex-Russian interior decorator named Ivan Moorcock.  You roll on the "When and Where" phase of the Seduction at Ease Factor 3.  This is neither one of (a) mirroring the James Bond film formulas exactly as Joshua suggested; nor (b) trying for depth of feeling what a gay English spy would feel like when doing so as Mike suggested.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70206/#Comment_70206" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T10:48:32+00:00" title="May 18, 2007 10:48AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let me try this a third time.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou're right, John, James Bond is not immersion sim.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr, rather, my inexperience with it, combined with the fact that the terms in question are notional and have no real definitions to them would may any attempt on my part to prove them X or Y form of sim irrellevant. My intent was to make a general point about sim, and using a game being bandied about in that discussion as an example hypothetically. Later, in reference to the whiff factor, I am saying that I'm unqualified to judge if it does a good job of any mode, I'm just saying that it can be not X, because it could be Y (which doesn't mean it is Y, just that it can be not X).
