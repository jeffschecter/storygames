You investigate until you get stumped or run low on resources, at which point you decide to Refresh. Upon Refreshing, something else happens: basically, I take the "the killer just killed another dude" that you see in Procedurals and apply it to the paranormal investigation Color. This, of course, gives you more clues, and prompts more investigation, until you Refresh again.

They're tricky to pull off, possibly too tricky for me entirely.<br/><br/>I tend to prefer mysteries where the culprit didn't have a perfect plan and ends up having to take an active role in keeping the investigators from unraveling everything, which of course just ends up producing more clues.  I also like mysteries that hinge on characters rather than clues, where several people may know details of what happened and the investigators just need to figure out how to convince them to spill their guts about it.  I also like the hard-boiled detective staple of the investigator always learning <i>something</i> about his quarry, even when he gets beaten up in an alley and dumped in a sanitarium to be kept under heavy sedation.<br/><br/>That said, I do share one thing with you:  I also dig mysteries where the main point is not whodunnit but rather <i>what you are going to do about it now</i>.

It structures the "mystery" so that the clues are revealed as increasing weirdness in the world around the characters, or in themselves, as a result of their taking action in the world. It assumes a pretty traditional "GM plans mystery, players explore it" kind of model, but occupies a ground upon which the PC's understanding of what's going on isn't considered necessary for the action to proceed. In that sense, it is what you might call "clue-agnostic" in the same way as Dogs, whereas Inspectres is "captifugical" (it flees clues) and TOC is captipetal (it's all about them).<br><br>The link is <a href="http://www.ganakagok.com/piper3.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243060/#Comment_243060" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-21T23:38:35+00:00" title="November 21, 2009 11:38PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A fundamental problem in how mysteries are usually handled is that these games present an ostensibly serious challenge, but completely punt the responsibility for providing consequences and meaningful play in case of failure. This is ridiculous.<br><br>Mysteries are difficult to solve, that's true - and even further, most people who enjoy mysteries in literature do so not because they try to solve them, but because they provide a fine framework for dramatic revelations. However, nothing in particular prevents us from playing challenge-based mystery games as long as <b>a)</b> we have means to hone the difficulty level of the mystery play to an enjoyable level, perhaps by iterating gameplay until the correct level for the players is found and <b>b)</b> the game is completely serious about being functional even when and if the players fail in solving the mystery.<br><br>Looking at how mystery games are usually ran, both of those conditions are failed miserably. The GM creates some mystery and decides that now he has enough clues for the players to solve it - how does he know, and how does this system ensure that he will do better the next time around if it proves that he's wrong? Likewise, just look at how these games (and by "these games" I mean Call of Cthulhu, my nemesis and dance partner) deal with failure procedure-wise: first you spend two hours doing nothing because there is no way for the player to know that he's stumped, then your character dies and the game ends. Really fun.<br><br>I'm personally especially mad about point the second up there - I find it a moral failing for a game designer to propose a challenge and then fail to provide the tools, techniques and content for making play meaningful or exiting it gracefully in case of failure. That's a fatal mixup of dramatic concerns with challenge play if something is - the poor scenario-writer can't even imagine that the players would fail at step A and thus never arrive at his great scene at step B, as surely the GM knows enough to fudge the results into success no matter what the players decide to do.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243062/#Comment_243062" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-22T04:09:14+00:00" title="November 22, 2009  4:09AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 22, 2009 4:15AM by Graham.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a standard Story Games line on mysteries, which goes like this:<br><br>1.

Story Games tend to favour the player gets control of the narration so he gets to define an element of the mystery over there is an existing mystery to reveal. <br/><br/>I think there is a difference between puzzle solving as a game element, which tends to reward player skills, and mystery though. Mystery is as suggested about revelation and in many ways is the spectre of meta-plot, things about the game that are revealed to the players as a reward for participation. Some folks like that kind of meta-reward for gaming, some don't. I suspect it parallels  with those folk who like to participate in a story, Dragonlance style, and those who want to create it. I don't think folks want to solve mystery in the same way they do a puzzle, but more earn the revelations in game. Mystery is pretty much anathema to story games though, because as Graham points out, what is the point to cool secrets if the players cannot directly use them in play.<br/><br/>Solving a murder in a game is usually more of a puzzle than a mystery and its worth bearing in mind that for most puzzles you have all the clues, the skill is in using them to solve the puzzle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243075/#Comment_243075" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-22T08:54:10+00:00" title="November 22, 2009  8:54AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>fundamental problem in how mysteries are usually handled is that these games present an ostensibly serious challenge, but completely punt the responsibility for providing consequences and meaningful play in case of failure.

When you buy a mystery novel, there is never any doubt, never ever, NEVER any doubt that the mystery will be solved. The willing suspension of this knowledge is the suspense of the book.  We can experience the thrills of the protagonist using cool skills, psychic powers, sheer bull-headedness, or whatever, to solve the mystery without, if you quizzed us, ever believing for one solitary moment that there was ever a chance that the protagonist wouldn't solve the mystery.<br/><br/>"Earning revelations" makes much more sense to me, having run certainly hundreds of mystery-based scenarios and never having people stomp out or cry or bawww about it.<br/><br/>The Call of Cthulhu chokepoint problem is a big one of design, there's no question - but ask any mystery fan if their favorite mystery novel stopped halfway through if they would like it as much and they will laugh at the very notion of the question. Note that plenty of plot-token style fantasy games have the same problem. "Oh, you didn't pick up the +3 dingus of smiting in room 1921?

Crimes aren't solved by following a trail of clues; they're solved by sussing out the motivations of all the suspects and testing them until the guilty reveal themselves. I find this approach more compatible with RPGs, because it asks the players to take a very active hand in digging up clues and resolving conflicts.<br/>\n<br/>\nGame prep just requires building a relationship map for the supporting cast: the victim, the suspects, their mistresses, bookies, rivals, relatives, etc. During the first half of the session, the protagonists explore this map by questioning, tailing, and researching their suspects. The second half is all about what they _do_ with that information: blackmail, bribery, alliances of convenience, backstabbing and betrayal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not a police procedural, by any means, but it does allow the players to solve and resolve a real, pre-determined mystery.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Dan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243118/#Comment_243118" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-22T13:01:20+00:00" title="November 22, 2009  1:01PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few questions Dan:<br/>\n<br/>\n-Were the two parts the same length?

It's not entirely true that the result is a character-focused game, since the gap between player and character is actually pretty narrow. That is, I don't think the game mechanics reliably produce any kind of robust character portraiture. The assumption is that faced with cosmic horror most people will react pretty much in the same way: start gibbering and raving. The game works best when players get into playing out their increasing desperation, confusion, and despair. In <i>Serial Homicide Unit</i>, the solution to mimic a detective sub-genre in which the bad guy getting away is a distinct possibility: the police procedural. Its approach is to say that you'll get (invent) clues, but whether you get enough of them in time to save the next victim, whom you care about because you've been playing them out not as victims but as people with dreams and aspirations that just might get cut short. The investigator "characters" in SHU are functional ciphers; they exist to introduce "clues" that have both a narrative function (guiding the story) and a game-mechanical one (letting you "win" the game), but the real story lies in the lives of the potential victims. In both cases, the effect is to shift the focus from the quote-unquote mystery to something else.<br><br>Of course, that's only half-true, because it implies that the mystery doesn't matter, really, but in fact it really does. But it doesn't matter more than player agency, however that's realized. I ran a Trail of Cthulhu game at Gencon that almost ran aground in the early stages when the players thought it was going to just be about me revealing clues to them -- "this guy reading us his story," as one of the players put it -- but picked up as soon as the players got the chance to <i>do something</i> in the game. It was a good lesson, and it colors how I'll design TOC-style mysteries from here on out.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/reverendbayn" title="reverendbayn"><img alt="reverendbayn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/reverendbayn">reverendbayn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243130/#Comment_243130" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-22T14:04:26+00:00" title="November 22, 2009  2:04PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 22, 2009 2:05PM by reverendbayn.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'll try to answers all three at once.

I've never seen this sort of game as particularly problematic, however; the same rules and procedures work whether your story has a backdrop of heroic monster-slaying or clever detecting, there's very little difference. Just remember that there's little reason to keep the players in the dark aside from pacing, and remember to not let mandatory success hinge on outdated dicing rituals. The challenging mystery thing is much more difficult as a design case due to how we don't really have many working case studies of the idea on paper as finished games, despite the fact that many people have played or tried to play that sort of games over the years.<br><br><i>Serial Homicide Unit</i> is an interesting game to be sure. It's not a challenge game but a storytelling one - as Bill says, it's also set in a grim genre wherein it's possible for the serial killer to get away completely. The players don't really have much influence over that aside from a bit of dicing strategy. I also wouldn't consider it much of a mystery game in anything except the most superficial structural part, as the focus of the game definitely is not in unknown information.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243202/#Comment_243202" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-22T21:37:19+00:00" title="November 22, 2009  9:37PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>The fundamental paradox of a "mystery game" that emulates the genre of detective fiction is that if the PCs are the<i>detectives</i>, then the fact that the killer might get away (or, more generally, that the mystery might remain unsolved) is unsatisfying for the players-as-their-own-audience because it breaks genre, but any<i>guarantee</i>that the killer will be caught is unsatisfying for the players-as-advocates-of-their-own-characters because it deprives them of agency in the narrative: if it's all going to work out anyway, then their choices don't matter.</blockquote>\nOf course they matter.

Don't reductio ad absurdum me. Are you seriously saying that removing the possibility of failure <i>in rpg play</i> (not in reading a mystery, which you have to concede is a different thing or we're talking from two different worlds) has <i>no effect</i> on how the game is experienced? That strikes me as implausible. Notice that your Nero Wolfe example is about what matters to the player-as-audience rather than to the player-as-agent, which I'm going to insist is a different kind of what matters.<br/><br/>I recently saw a post-game discussion of a <i>Trail of Cthulhu</i> game where one of the players said something like, "I would have liked to have heard the words, 'This is a core clue' at least once." The implication of that is that the player expects specific pieces of information highlighted for their significance to the mystery plot. It also requires a meta-communicative move -- play that is about playing the game, rather than about being in the fiction -- and it occurred to me that there are some players for whom that OOC move would be cheating, or at least disruptive. "If you're going to tell me what the important clues are, why am I even playing?"<br/><br/>My point was that when you make procedural or game-mechanical moves to ensure that the mystery gets solved, you remove part of a challenge that some people enjoy.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243225">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243225/#Comment_243225" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-23T05:15:06+00:00" title="November 23, 2009  5:15AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2009 6:27AM by komradebob.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "My point was that when you make procedural or game-mechanical moves to ensure that the mystery gets solved, you remove part of a challenge that some people enjoy."<br/><br/>Encyclopedia Brown willl solve it if the players don't.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, those books might be a better model for building a mystery RPG than most others.

There was a set cast of characters and locations. I tracked time so an intervie took an hour, going to a new location took an hour etc. I knew what had happened and we play acted out all the interviews. There were no skill rolls it was all real life interviewing. A lot of fun to do but SOOOOO labor intensive. Also I knew I could never tell anyone else how to run it. I did these games when I was in police administration school. The fun was in the play acting. I learned from these games that the actual mystery had to be painfully obvious for the players to solve it. If there was anyway for them to go astray they would. <br/><br/>Now I do murder mysteries where players make up the clues as they play (Sherlock Holmes Engle Matrix Games). Only one player is Holmes, the others are potential suspects. The clues made up narrow down who could have done it. The fun of these games is trying to pin the murder on one of the other players. In this way it is a competitive game. There is no problem of clues being worthless because if they were made up it was for a reason. I've heard people say that this approach is unrealistic. Sadly I think it is more realistic than any of us would wish. Police form theories and then find clues to support them. It's not an objective exercise.<br/><br/>Right now Komrade Bob and I are in a variant of a EMG mystery where the whole game is pre ploted. Each turn people make up answers to the plot point of the moment. The fun is making up the story but also in trying to get your answer through. We count up victory points based on who'se action wins the roll and who built off of which action. As a game it works well in PBEM formats but maybe it's not a real mystery. There is no chance for failure for instance - it's just a question of how you succeed.<br/><br/>I like the comments about Call of Cthulhu. I love that game. It's a great one shot con game. They are role playing tour de forces (like my old murder mysteries) but like my old games they have to be painfully obvious. I don't mind that. Like reading Lovecraft a lot of the fun is in play acting feeling the horror as the insanity of the plot is unfolded.<br/><br/>I'm playing around with a new MG format where players place tiles to create a location with encounter tiles on it. The game is divided into two parts. Both parts score victory points in different ways. The first half of the game is about finding clues about what the twist of the game is. The second half involves resolving the twist. When players fail action rolls their character's stress increases (which develops that characters personal matrix). It's all untested but I have a draft of the rules. Not directly a murder mystery but it does involve making up clues. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243240/#Comment_243240" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-23T07:22:33+00:00" title="November 23, 2009  7:22AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2009 7:48AM by Bill_White.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Bill_White</cite>But that's not in fact what I said.

That's what I mean when I talk about "player-as-agent" in a detective game: the player wants the chance to be Holmes, not Lestrade.<br/><br/>So when I say if you go too far in the direction of making sure the right bad guy gets caught <i>procedurally</i> or <i>game-mechanically</i>, then the player's choices don't matter, what I mean is that you face the danger of turning the player into Lestrade: if he gets it wrong, someone swoops in to fix his mistakes. So the Lestrade player's presence in the story <i>doesn't matter</i> (not "is pointless") in the same way it would if his mistakes were allowed to stand.<br/><br/>So not only is what I said <b>not</b> "clearly completely wrong," it's in fact <i>absolutely right!</i>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>"My point was that when you make procedural or game-mechanical moves to ensure that the mystery gets solved, you remove part of a challenge that some people enjoy."<br/><br/>Encyclopedia Brown will solve it if the players don't.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, those books might be a better model for building a mystery RPG than most others.

An EB mystery is almost already a game, or at least an "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_literature" rel="nofollow">ergodic text</a>" in that an important part of the experience is whether or not you "solve" the crime before Encyclopedia Brown does.

Someone is always feeding Mike Hammer the mystery in chapter-sized chunks after he's been hit on the head and tied to a chair. Doesn't mean we don't get psyched for a cool scene when he gets hit on the head and tied to a chair.<br/><br/>Now we're getting somewhere! One correction, though: I didn't say that the point of a detective story is <i>if</i> the mystery will be solved, it's <i>how</i> it will be solved, because what the detective-hero brings to the table in your classic mystery story is a unique methodology or perspective without which the crime goes unsolved, or the killer gets away, or the police nab the wrong man. Even in tough-guy detective stories, the private dick even if otherwise unexceptional is the one who cares enough (whether because of love or of money) to walk down some mean streets and follow the case to its end.<br/><br/>But I notice that one fundamental gap between what you're saying and what I'm saying is that you're talking about RPG participation operating strictly from the perspective of the <i>audience</i> (e.g., getting psyched to watch a cool scene involving the hero being hit on the head and tied to a chair) while I'm saying that it includes the perspective of the <i>hero</i>--that is, the player-character (or a piece of him, at least: the C part). It's certainly true that no one reading the book or watching the movie expects the hero to fail. But there are plenty of fictional personages who anticipate the possibility, including the hero in particular--a point which you concede.<br/><br/>So when I play a character who is a detective, that's different than reading about a detective character. In the latter instance, I'm curious about how the detective will solve the mystery, and I anticipate that by the end I'll know how Miss Marple figured it out, even if I couldn't do it myself. Alternately, if she can't figure it out, I expect that <i>I'll</i> know <i>as the reader</i> who did it and why and all that stuff, including what heroic flaw or idiosyncratic foible or turn of just plain bad luck prevented her from catching the crook. In the former instance, though, all of that audience stuff is also layered with hero-stuff: I want the chance to turn over a few clues, see where they lead, and by dint of my own cleverness or perspicacity or doggedness or whatever it is that I think I've got <i>figure out the mystery</i>. Now, if I get stuck, I still want a chance to "get to the end of the adventure" (in-game, IC) and de-brief afterward (metagame, OOC) about what happened and whether I missed an obvious clue and so forth.<br/><br/>Which is why I said it's a paradox, although maybe I should have said dilemma. Because when you're designing a mystery adventure for role-playing, you have to balance those audience-level factors with the hero-level factors. At least, that's the lesson I've taken away from my own experiences running that kind of game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243285/#Comment_243285" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-23T11:49:19+00:00" title="November 23, 2009 11:49AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At the risk of being obvious, it seems like you two are talking past each other: I think Bill_White is saying that if you're playing a character in a mystery, you ought to <i>want</i> to solve the mystery, but if none of your efforts in that direction have any chance of failing then you are denied any sense of agency and your desire to solve the mystery is kind of pointless.

If you treat mysteries as challenges <i>for the player</i>, there's a hard design problem involved, because committing to that challenge seriously means that players have to be able to fail, or there is by definition no challenge. If you regard the mystery as mere window-dressing for some other kind of story, then solving the mystery becomes little more than a waypoint in the game's pacing mechanism, but if it's the point of the whole affair, then the trick becomes to figure out ways to make failure interesting, dramatic, or engaging.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243324/#Comment_243324" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-23T19:36:56+00:00" title="November 23, 2009  7:36PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yah, you're both right.

The key idea in it is that the player characters who work as detectives or whatever are constantly being pressured by cases that pile on their desks. The players have great leeway in triaging and priorizing this mass of work (possibly centralize this one by making one of the characters the boss), but the thing is that whenever they fail a case, that has an adverse impact of some sort on the overall health of their community. I figure that this gives the players enough of a motivation for working the cases while taking care of good failure procedures as well - the characters can easily fail just like detectives do in real life, and the game won't end because of it; everybody just feels a bit bad and comes to work the next day just like before. This has many benefits for the design, including the fact that game balance is a non-issue; whatever means I might device for actually resolving cases in this game, it doesn't matter if the given case is too easy or too hard, as play will be rewarding and meaningful regardless. There is no single point of failure like Call of Cthulhu and the like have, where failing only a single case ever will often ruin the whole campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243335/#Comment_243335" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-23T21:14:57+00:00" title="November 23, 2009  9:14PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: dr_pete</cite>If you don't follow the trail left at the beginning, this means the bad guys continue to operate... so what do they do next?

Now throw the PCs into the middle of it, stumbling around yelling and poking their noses into things.  Even if they don't actually find anything, their mere presence upsets the balance: people will want something from them, will want to steer them away, will want to stop them at any cost.  Everything keeps looping back because as long as the PCs are in the midst of it, no one can get <i>anything</i> they want without dealing with the PCs in one way or another.<br/><br/>And every time it loops back, that's another opportunity for the PCs to get unstuck and move their story forward.  Maybe they enlist allies, maybe they learn something, maybe they catch the real culprit in a lie.  As long as everyone wants something, there's a reason to bring them back into the mix.<br/><br/>This is kind of the model I try to use when doing mysteries in the "characters, not clues" vein, although I don't think I've ever specifically drawn up a relationship map or thought of it in those terms.  I tend to just make sure that the crime is not perfect and static, but an evolving mess of hasty decisions and desperate moves.  I'd stop and ask "What does this NPC know about what the PCs are doing right now?" and "What would he want to do about it?", and then push forward with that.  Kind of fun, really; certainly more fun than looking at a list of clues and hoping that the PCs will stumble across one of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243339/#Comment_243339" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-23T21:57:50+00:00" title="November 23, 2009  9:57PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I have a sketch of a game in my drawer about slice of life police procedural that I invented after watching too much<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Watch" rel="nofollow">Third Watch</a>and some German detective series late at night.

I want to provoke responses from NPCs, but most GMs (in my experience) just want you to follow the clues. (Like I'm Toucan Sam Spade!) With "Secrets &amp; Lies," I really wanted to provide mechanics that helped players shake the tree.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a GM, nothing helps me handle this style of play better than having a relationship map. I can't recommend it enough. I usually end up scribbling notes all over mine as the game progresses, so I have a record of who's doing what to whom.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Dan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243350/#Comment_243350" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-24T01:06:49+00:00" title="November 24, 2009  1:06AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2009 1:07AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: reverendbayn</cite><br>We call this "Shaking the Tree" and you'd be surprised how hard I've tried to get wring it out of GMs over the years. </br></blockquote>\nIn a noir detective game we played a few years back that owed a lot to Philip Marlowe and Mike Hammer, we called it "Substituting hit points for investigation."

All of the relationship links on my maps take the form of "owes money to," "having an affair with," "being blackmailed by," and so forth. If the relationship doesn't indicate a desire or a secret that can be useful to the investigators, then it's not doing it's job.<br/>\n<br/>\n--Dan<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. There's a big list of such relationships in "Secrets &amp; Lies," as part of a table that also includes classic noir characters to pair them with: bookie, bartender, mobster, movie star, etc. It's intended as a quick relationship map generator.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243598/#Comment_243598" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-25T02:39:24+00:00" title="November 25, 2009  2:39AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><br>You could build a relationship map of sorts -- suspects, victims, the real culprit, etc., all connected together by the crime, all wanting particular things.</br></blockquote>\nThe central mechanic for A Taste For Murder looks like this.

They know the other stuff will happen regardless of what they do, but putting together clues might give them ammunition against it.  Plus, I always have a plan B in case they fail to find a clue.  <br/><br/>Part of how I do this is I throw out a bunch of clues without having any idea how they link together.  I just put out cool things: a book, a stranger, a message, etc.  Then the players find them, or glimpse them, and start speculating what might be going on.  I take the best ideas and make that the solution.  Sometimes they don't out-right tell me what's they think is going on, but you can guess:  "Is there a pattern in these killings if I line them up with a map?  Can I roll versus Criminology to see that?"  "Sure."   Then success could let me say there's a pattern, and failure could let me say they haven't got enough information to answer that question, but might if they went and got another clue.<br/><br/>And in games that aren't investigative, I still like mysteries, so I always have something lurking at the shadows, some hint of somebody not being what they seem, and so on, and let the players who enjoy the long scope of games enjoy the reward when these clues come together.  By tossing out a lot of hooks and remembering them, I can come up with what the mystery actually is later on, and then retroactively include those hooks.  Players who have been paying attention will feel rewarded for having done so.  They may even have figured out chunks of the mystery along the way (again, they came up with a good idea and it fit, or my good idea retroactively fit.)  This worked for the X-Files. . . it works for Lacuna too, btw.<br/><br/>In a game that is more story games oriented, like Dogs, I'll dump the mystery up front, because the mystery isn't the point.  It looks like a mystery game, but it's really not.   <br/><br/>And I agree with the "you're the bad guy, don't tell" syndrome being boring.  If you're the bad guy, tell.  The players will get a lot of enjoyment out of knowing what their characters do not know.  This is why we have fun when we see bad guys sneaking up on unsuspecting good guys in movies.  In fact, do that in games too.  Tell them there's an ambush up ahead that they don't see, and ask them how they are reacting.  Or cut away to a two sentence snippet of what the bad guy is doing, then go back to the players.<br/><br/>That's how I like my mysteries.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
