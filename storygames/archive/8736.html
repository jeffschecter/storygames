I believe they are one of the best roleplaying tools there is in the game, and one of the most underused, abused and misunderstood.<br/><br/>Most people think of it as a lousy restriction to avoid the players from doing whatever they want. Some people like it because it gives them the sense there would be nothing but anarchy and chaos from players and characters fighting and it helps them decide what goes and what not.<br/><br/>I like them, but in a very different light. They do not tell me what I could or should not do. They tell me a lot about how I perceive and interact with the world, in a philosophical and ethical way.<br/><br/>And I have found that most people don't really think about the implications they have. Every LG Paladin must be a lame boy scout incapable of acting in any reasonable way, always bossing everyone around and acting all righteous. And every CE baddie must be this chaotic entity without purpouse or reason, only interested in fighting and doing bad things. And every other alignment is just an in-between.<br/><br/>The one that infuriates me the most is the people that choose CG just because they feel that way they can claim to be "good", while beeing allowed to do bad things. "I'm chaotic. That's the way I am!" Godammin!!!<br/><br/>I for once have always loved the way the two axis worked, and how the different blends allowed you to develope a complete, complex and "human" personality for your characters (and even for your monsters). (I have to confess I hated it when they took them out of 4 Ed.)<br/><br/>Now, how have I made this work for me so far? It is actually quite simple.<br/><br/>The Law-Chaos axis is not related to how good or bad I am. Quite obvious, isn't it? Then what does it tell me? It speaks about my adherence to my personal code of conduct. That code can be based on something external (laws, religious principles, chain of command, my elders...), internal (my own discipline, how methodic and logical I am...) or situational (I go with what everyone else thinks or does).<br/><br/>When I am closer to the Law pole, I believe I must act as close to that code as possible. Thus I dislike going against the law, against my honor, against my boss... As long as I follow that, I may even not care about other things not related to my code (thus a dwarf might be as stubborn as it comes when dealing with what the elders told him, while regarding "those foolish human laws" as unimportant and mere guidelines). When I'm closed to the Chaos pole, I dislike limits, methods, orders. I do not follow that or any other code. I'd rather do things the way I like, the moment I like to, in any way I believe it fits at the moment. Therefore I might follow orders one moment, while disobeying them the next one. It is not that I just do random stuff without any sort of goal. It is that I only follow my whims and desires, thus while it might appear random to others, I always have a reason for doing what I do (even when some times that reason can be a mistery, even to myself).<br/><br/>The middle ground (the Neutral part of the Axis) means I understand the importance and use of the code, but I only adhere to it when I consider it is the best for my goals. As long as I consider them fair, I'll follow your laws. As long as I see them as wise and pragmatic, I'll obey the elders. As long as I don't have to give up to much, I'll be disciplined and do what I must.<br/><br/>The Good-Bad axis is not related to the western extremist "I'm good, so I'll be all nice and helpful. I'm bad, so I'll randomly and purpouselessly conquer the world!" It relates to what I'll be capable of doing to and for other people. If I'm willing to put other people before me, I'm good. If I'm willing to put myself before other people, I'm bad.<br/><br/>So the closer I am to the Good pole, the more things I'm willing to do for others. The greater the sacrifices I believe I could do for other people's sakes. I can get to hurt others, as long as I percieve that is for the greater good. The closer I am to the Evil pole, the more stuff I'm willing to let people suffer to get something good for me. It is not that I hurt people "just because". That is not evil, that is lame. The key is "what benefit would I get from doing this?" It might be power, pleasure, money, selfrighteousness, vengance, fun...<br/><br/>The middle gound (the "other" Neutral) means I'd rather put myself first, that I would do what would benefit me the most, but that doesn't mean I don't care about the welfare of others. If I feel justified enough, I might hurt others, but only if I believe there is no other choice. And most deffinitely I'd rather hurt strangers than those close to me.<br/><br/>In my eyes, the thing is not that some alignments allow or disallow you do do stuff. The thing is the way you justify why or how you feel about doing them.<br/><br/>The classical internet alignment controversy (which keeps resurfacing over and over again in any D&amp;D forum). Is poison use evil? Does a Paladin gets to be punished just for using poison?<br/><br/>My take is "it depends". If in the paladin eyes he is following his code, and if he feels it will be for the greater good, he might. He might be following his orders, codes and laws (how different is killing a monster by the sword to doing it by poison?). And he might be willing to sacrifice his own "purity" by dirtying his own hands "for the other people's sakes". (If he kills the monster himself, then no one else will need to kill it afterwards.) Thus he used poison, without ever falling outside of what his alignment "would allow him to do".<br/><br/>So, Story-Games people, what are your takes on the Alignment thing? How have you used it? In what way has it become a roleplaying tool to you, rather than a simple mechanical limitation?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193240/#Comment_193240" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T09:47:45+00:00" title="February 19, 2009  9:47AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See, there's this common fantasy trope of good vs. evil, and it generally means some absolute good and absolute evil and the shades of grey be damned. D&amp;D tends to take that black and white view of morality, and it works. Good people kill evil monsters (and humanoids) because they're irrevocably evil. Everything is simple and clean that way. Do you kill the kobold babies? Sure, they're irrevocably evil. Do you wipe out every single orc in the country, a la ethnic cleansing? Sure, they're irrevocably evil. <br/><br/>It's a terribly unrealistic view of the world, but we all know it's a fantasy game. Maybe we play fantasy games to escape from the difficult moral and ethical choices of reality. <br/><br/>When you start to look at in-game behavior a little more closely, it's pretty repugnant. It feels like a weak justification for prejudice and racism, not to mention all manner of war crimes. Do you kill the kobold babies? No, they haven't done anything. Do you kill the kobold warrior? He's just protecting his home. Why are you even in this cave fighting kobolds? For the treasure? Who is the monster again?<br/><br/>Start looking at the game that way, and it ruins the fun for a lot of people. Maybe some people want really difficult moral choices in their D&amp;D, but I suspect most just want to kill monsters and take their stuff, and not feel fucking guilty about it. <br/><br/>So alignment keeps the game simple and guilt-free. No matter which alignment you choose, the game has given you permission to kill monsters and take their stuff. If you're Good, you're killing Evil monsters, because they're Evil and need to die. If you're Evil, then you're killing everyone, because you're Evil and you don't care. If you're Neutral, you've basically said you're selfishly not taking sides (let's assume it's selfish not to take the Good path, but not to commit to Evil either); in any case, your Neutral character is killing everyone who stands in his way, but is probably fighting Evil most of the time, because you only chose Neutral because it sounded the most like Libertarianism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193253/#Comment_193253" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T10:37:31+00:00" title="February 19, 2009 10:37AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can understand that "absolute good and evil" thing.

D&amp;D is "ethics fiction" where, by hypothesis, we all agree that there really are these ethical objects with independent, objective existence, and that have real physical consequences in the game world.  If your character is evil, then he will be repelled by a Circle of Protection, and a paladin will be able to see it in him the same way that you or I can see the color of someone's hair.  If we like, we can debate the extent to which D&amp;D "evil" corresponds to IRL "evil", whether IRL "evil" has a referent at all, and so on, and speaking as a philosophy major (lo these many years ago), I believe that can be fun too.

I think you can draw a line from DnD's alignments through to Pendragon's Passions and Vampire's Humanity and all the way through to games like Dogs, which do the precise opposite of alignment. If that makes sense. It's part of the context in which we make our RPGs. <br/><br/>I mean, yes, alignments are unrealistic, but so are levels and so are BABs and so are THAC0s and so are, heaven help us, owlbears. <br/><br/>They are part of the game, and part of the experience of play. Just so levels are a tool to help you renegotiate the game every so often, so alignments are a tool to express certain parts of the praxis of the game. Does that make sense? <br/><br/>I wouldn't play DnD without alignment, because alignment is the main thing that still makes DnD (to me) interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_193272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193272/#Comment_193272" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-19T11:46:26+00:00" title="February 19, 2009 11:46AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My main point is that D&amp;D chose the fantasy-based alignment system it has for a reason.

My point is how would my character react to different situations <b>because</b> he is good or evil. And just because I don't agree with everything the Paladin does or says, that doesn't mean I can't be a very LG person too. That is pretty much my point. There are many possible interpretations of good and evil. We could stick to labeling it as such. But how interesting does it get if I just play every LG character exactly the same?<br/><br/>Think of this in a similar way to what Graham did in the other thread (which is why I mentioned that one in the OP).<br/><br/>The same way a low Charisma can mean being a geeky thief, I can roleplay a LE character as either a honorable assasin, a cold and creepy psycho or as a megalomaniac who believes he is the answer to the world's problems.

I've been thinking of how to justify alignment and make it more interesting. Something I go back to is that the idea came from a series of books where Law and Chaos were in direct conflict. I think The Rod of Seven parts is specifically about this. So your alignment is literally who you have aligned yourself with. When the final showdown happens, and a winner has been declared, who did you support? Do you get the spoils, or are you the spoils?<br/><br/>This is kind of easy to see when you're looking at a setting like Dragonlance. It's Paladine vs Takhisis, and then the Chaos comes in. You have alignment with good, evil, law and chaos, and 3 of them are personified in some fashion or other. If you look at some of the more generic settings in D&amp;D, like Forgotten Realms and Greyhawk, alignment doesn't seem to matter. There are small skirmishes here and there, but it's not at the final showdown stage, the way it is in DL. In Planescape alignment clearly matters as well, as the planes have been designed according to the 9 alignments and they're personified, and there are various wars going on. Dark Sun also brings things in, if you're evil you side with the Sorcerer Kings, with the ultimate evil being the Dragon. If you're good you side with the people, and the ultimate good is the Avingon. Law and Chaos isn't there quite as much, but you still have an area where alignment matters, and you can see alignment being a team thing. Birthright does it too, you've got Azrai and the Awnsheighlen on Evil, and everyone else on Good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193417/#Comment_193417" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-20T10:30:14+00:00" title="February 20, 2009 10:30AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Geeky Question to all you, people.<br/><br/>Superman is clearly a LG guy.<br/><br/>What about Batman?

Gotham City is rife with corruption, but Batman's response is always to remove the corrupt officials, never to question the system itself: he believes in the system when it is not run by evil people.<br/><br/>Also, whenever you see an Elseworlds where Bruce Wayne isn't tormented by the loss of his parents, he generally becomes a stand-up, right-thinking, squared-away solid citizen, as lawful as the day is long; that's probably the person he longs to be, but Gotham's just too dirty to ever allow him to be that person.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_193466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/193466/#Comment_193466" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-20T16:28:02+00:00" title="February 20, 2009  4:28PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2009 4:28PM by Tristan.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My take is that he is LG.<br/><br/>See, he might stay outside of the Law, but he only breaks the rules for the greater good, and (as Tasty mentioned) he does so only when it is run by evil people.<br/><br/>And, you see, he is this rational, highly disciplined individual with a strict code of conduct he forces himself to follow, even by sacrificing himself (in pretty much every possible sense).<br/><br/>So he is a tool for order and law, even while he is not the "by the book" type.<br/><br/>I like doing this sort of stuff.

He's an extension of the law.  The police summon Batman when annoying things like evidence, civil rights, laws against excessive force... you get the idea.  He's the arm of the law without all of the annoying democratic protections it's supposed to afford.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd why does he do it?  Kicks?  Vengeance for his parents?  Whatever, his motives seem to be personal rather than altruistic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ran my last campaign trying to really play with alignments by having the players play as mostly evil monster characters in a goblin city.  The point of the campaign was that evil isn't inherent, it's trained.  The only way the characters could escape being slaves was by enlisting as slave drivers.  One player was a lawful evil goblin cleric, who delivered sermons on the righteousness of slavery.  Another was a chaotic neutral kobold sorceror/dragonmage who simply had friendly chats with his fellow slave-drivers and just tried to improve his lot.  Another was a chaotic evil ogre fighter who was looking for work, and liked any society in which he was free to munch on the odd goblin slave when he got hungry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregory" title="Gregory"><img alt="Gregory" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregory">Gregory</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194953/#Comment_194953" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-01T17:39:59+00:00" title="March  1, 2009  5:39PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All this talk of alignment and comics has made me realize something. Rorsharch was a Lawful Good Rogue. Think about it, right? What are his skills? He could find places to get vital information from. He would then proceed to interrogate whatever luckless souls that were within there until he got the information he needed. Then he'd follow that info, his one track mind going full force. When confronted, how did he defend himself? He'd set traps with ordinary items, improvise weapons, make use of his superior agility. He would brutally murder killers and rapists and shop lifters. And why? Because his justice was absolute. Because there's good and evil, the gray area was made up by the bad people.  I dunno, if I can ever find a 4E game when I go to Nuke School, I'm gonna try to get the DM to let me do up a Lawful Good Rogue.
