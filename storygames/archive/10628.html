It's still under development and I'm adding many things as I develop the game, so you may consider this as the skeleton of the game's crunch. But since I've translated it in English, I'd like to offer it to those who would like to playtest it and send me their comments.<br/>\nBasically, it's a strongly GAM steampunk game on spies competing against each other.<br/>\nYou can find the playtest PDF in my blog: http://chiseledgear.blogspot.com/<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't even consider it a beta yet, but if you like to check it and let me know what you think of the mechanics (by possibly playtesting them), I'd love to hear your feedback. You could, if you want, write here or leave a comment on my blog.<br/>\nThank you and best regards!<br/>\nTazio                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
