The problem was, they hadn't had enough playtesting to feel comfortable releasing it to the general public. The solution, they put out an "ashcan" (beta) version and sold it to a few brave souls that promised to play it and give them as much feedback as possible. That's us! <br/> <br/>Aside from any general feedback, questions or comments you may have, the designers did have a few specific issues they wanted us to consider:<br/> <br/>1. What are better terms for game elements like Categories (the dice categories that you assigned your rolls to), Runners (you guys), Chasers (them), etc? What should the GM be called?<br/>2. Does there need to be a better transition from the last regular scene to the epilogues (crossroad scenes)? What are some of your ideas about that?<br/>3. Should there be more guidelines or parameters for forming character Questions? Are there any bad "types" of questions in general?<br/>4. You could also shorten a game of Psi Run by starting each character with fewer Questions. What are your thoughts on that?<br/>5. We need a great epilogue example for the section on Crossroad scenes!<br/><br/>Feel free to answer all the questions or just one, but keep in mind that genereal thoughts on the game are greatly appreciated as well. Just send the feedback to me and I'll send it on where it needs to go. <br/> <br/>Here's some stuff that Bernie was working on...<br/> <br/>Bernie had a pretty good idea about an alternate way to have Psi function in the game (I'm partial to the second "Level 3" option personally):<br/> <br/>Psi Power leveling: <br/>As a player successfully uses psi power they should become better using their said psi power.<br/> <br/>PSI level 1 (player is unaware of psi power, roll psi dice every time)  <br/>6:  Power causes no trouble (gain psi level 2)<br/>5:  Power is wild;  either injures people or breaks things<br/>3-4:  psi storm; people are dead and things are destroyed<br/>1-2: Psi power does not work                    <br/> <br/>PSI Level 2 (player can choose to use psi power or psi power will activate under stress)<br/>5-6:  Power causes no trouble (after 2 trouble free uses, gain psi level 3)<br/>3-4:  Power is wild;  either injures people or breaks things <br/>1-2:  psi storm; people are dead and things are destroyed<br/> <br/>PSI level 3 (player can use psi power at will)<br/>5-6:  Power causes no trouble <br/>2-4:  Power is wild;  either injures people or breaks things<br/>1:  psi storm; people are dead and things are destroyed <br/> <br/>-or- (don't which one would be better for game play)<br/> <br/>PSI level 3 (player can use psi power at will)<br/>4-6:  Power causes no trouble<br/>2-3:  Power is wild;  either injures people or breaks things<br/>1:  psi storm; people are dead and things are destroyed<br/> <br/>Bernie also had an idea about Harm that I dig (I think I'll use it when I play Psi Run from now on!): <br/> <br/>Harm resolution:<br/>Instead of loosing the bonus die, highest dice roll is removed                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115748/#Comment_115748" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-21T00:11:13+00:00" title="December 21, 2007 12:11AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike responded with this:<br/><br/>I liked the idea Bernie had about maybe adding another category in the crossroads section. Traitor would be kind of neat, especially if someone had been being a douche the entire night. [EDIT: Mike is referring to the idea that "Traitor" be an optional Crossroads word, that way a particularly shifty/shady character can be revealed as an agent of the Chasers all along!]<br/><br/>I don't know why, but I like the idea of the GM being referred to by a pronoun. Them, Him, They, something like that, since he's controlling the guys coming after you. <br/><br/>A nicer transition would be cool, but I have no idea how to do something like that. It would really require the cooperation of the players. If the story they've made makes sense and flows, so will the ending, if the story doesn't, neither will the epilogue. <br/><br/>There aren't any bad questions, maybe silly ones though. It comes down to the players again and what kind of game they want to see. If 2 people want a silly game and 2 people want a serious one, there might be some problems. If everyone's cool with a serious/silly game, than it doesn't really matter. The players just have to talk with each other about how they want to play that night. I can't see there being any guidelines in the rulebook, because that feels like it could really change the game. Maybe some example questions though, from the silly to serious, and saying in the book that this is an example of a silly or serious question. <br/><br/>I think Psi Run is short enough as it is, if anything, I'd say add some more questions in.<br/><br/>I think it would be nice to have the people know that they're being chased. On our game, our characters never really learned that someone was actively hunting them. They knew they were being transported somewhere by an unknown third party, and then we just took off. We as players knew, but I don't remember the characters ever realizing someone was looking for them right then and there. Again, that has to do with the people playing the game and never letting the chasers catch up, but something in there to give us the harried feeling would be neat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115749/#Comment_115749" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-21T00:15:28+00:00" title="December 21, 2007 12:15AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As Mike mentioned, the Players never once let the Chasers catch up.

I think the categories are fine as well as the name of runners and chasers.  You could even just call the categories us and them to play on the paranoid aspect the paranormal beliefs. "THEY" are always keeping the truth down, or "THEY" are monitoring our thoughts so we must wear foil on our heads <br/> <br/>2. Yes, most definitely. The game can stop rather abrubtly.  I think the person who ends it must at the least be required to explain whatever happened in the scene that ends causes the resolution, what makes everyone stop running. Also as we discussed before I don't think it would be a bad idea for the chasers to catch up automatically at the end if they haven't caught up at least once. <br/> <br/>3. Yes I'm not sure what but I think without parameters the game can go in completely differen't directions depending on the people playing. Also I think it would be a good idea to put requirements on types of questions.  Like at least one about a power of course and then maybe one about the person or place. Then maybe one about an item on your person.  I think with just make so many questions some characters might not contribute the future direction of the story as others.  I think it would also add more shape to the characters. I'm not saying that all of the questions should be defined but maybe like three. <br/> <br/>4. I think leaving it as it it is fine just bring it up in the book that there is the option of changing it if you want. <br/><br/><br/><br/>I like bernies idea about harm resolution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115751/#Comment_115751" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-21T00:20:58+00:00" title="December 21, 2007 12:20AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2007 12:27AM by Jarvis.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew replied with: <br/><br/>1. I did not really have any problem with the names of anything because the names seem to well describe what they are actually refering to.  I feel like out of character terms should be as simple and to the point as possible so people know what you are talking about and the terms in the game seemed fine for doing that.<br/><br/>2. That was one thing that did seem really strange that the game ends so abruptly, for instance in our case while we were randomly at the pet vet.  One thing overall that might fit into this category could be that each person is allowed to only reveal one question per scene.  This could really help the game stay at least that five scenes long instead of allowing people to do a whole bunch in the first scene and all of a sudden the game is over.  That doesn't really help with the actual transition problem though and in the context of this game I do not really know what you could do other than maybe adding in a final scene just to wrap things up that everyone could participate in and would then lead them each into their individual crossroads scenes.  Now that I think about that it seems a really good, if not neccessary component so that the game does not just end so abruptly like ours did.<br/><br/>3. As I mentioned before I really liked the freedom of the questions so that each person could do and incorporate what they wanted into the game.  As long as everyone agress on the mood before hand I think the freedom is great letting people to be as specific or ambigous as they wish. <br/><br/>4. That seems fine if you want a shorter game, I don't know that I would want it to be shorter, but someone might want to and I do not see how that would be a problem.  Once again I might mention the one question per scene revealing rule so that the game would not be over super quick.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115752/#Comment_115752" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-21T00:22:32+00:00" title="December 21, 2007 12:22AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2007 12:28AM by Jarvis.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Liz, this being her 3rd or so RPG ever, said:<br/><br/>1.

The GM should be called \u201cThe Voice\u201d or  maybe \u201cThe voice over\u201d. For the Runners a good name would be \u201cthe experiments\u201d or just leave it as is and let every new group do what they will with it. The Chasers really leaves it open to what game style the characters want, If you want to define the game into a certain style then change the name. <br/> <br/>2. There definitely needs to be a better translation. You might have the Chasers come in at that point or if they have been defeated then bring in a boss of the organization. <br/> <br/>3. There needs to be a guiding force in the story. It was really freeform for me. Our guiding force ended up being a random cell phone that someone added at the last second. Bad questions are any that don't get you anywhere. If you cant think of how to use that question then throw it out. <br/> <br/>4. That would be better maybe for younger players but I like the whole 6 questions as it is because you always get to choose whether you answer a question or not by your play style.  <br/> <br/>5. The scene cuts to a south American jungle. You see a plane wreck in a tree nearby. You are lost without a single thing to survive on but you wits and the clothes on your back. You wake up thinking where am I and oh no not again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115754">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115754/#Comment_115754" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-21T00:32:41+00:00" title="December 21, 2007 12:32AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So there's everything.

Its' simplicity, elegance, and beat-you-over-the-head emphasis on narrative is profound and beautiful to me. Whenever we get a group that eschews crunch for compelling story, you're our go-to guy. Can't wait to see those pins and tokens you pitch Ram's way; I'm sure I'll gank at least one of them. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore" title="chris_moore"><img alt="chris_moore" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jesus8880.com/chapters/gematria/images/greek%20letters/psi-cap.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chris_moore">chris_moore</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115890/#Comment_115890" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-21T11:39:41+00:00" title="December 21, 2007 11:39AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!
