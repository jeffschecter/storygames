Really, I do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo much effort that so often turns out variants on a stereotyped basic model, so much detail that never gets looked at, so much cultural blindness, so much focus on the wrong things.<br/>\n<br/>\nI once made a list about what I hated about world-building, and why, and then realised that the list made a<br/>\na pretty good set of charter statements for ... building a world.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh bugger ... :( I didn't want to go there. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt wasn't though I was a complete stranger to it all though. I've long laboured long in the vineyards of Glorantha, one of the more popular and better realised rpg worlds, gaming, gming, producing and editing supplements, writing countless articles and stories, building community. I've seen Glorantha's impressive, vibrant creative highs and its essentialist, endless recycling lows. I learned a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also a systemless and theatrical gamer, and have been playing with and developing its forms for nearly twenty years on the Oz convention circuit. I know my catharsis just like I know my katabasis. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey seem very different things, and in truth I have two fairly discrete groups of gaming friends, each of whom tend to look slightly suspiciously at the other. :) The tension is always interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat unites both my interest streams of course, is the love of story and the flow of emotion and creativity. That's what keeps me gaming: telling stories, and listening to stories. Mythopoetics: creating stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if a story background can help in upping the wonder, in questioning the obvious, in revealing the invisible or in demonstrating a little more of the infinite possibilities for being human, then I will take to it like a<br/>\nduck to Hueymakt. When background serves story, serves genre, when creativity is encouraged, then the results can be truly grand. That's what I *do* like about world building.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm torn by the idea of a world as a big dumb narrative object, a story and a wonder in itself. Its an intriguing idea, an inspiring one, but it can too easily lead away from roleplaying directness. For me, a gaming environment should be less on facts and more on ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of which is a long-winded way of introducing Ontolona, my attempt to apply the lessons I have learned to a new<br/>\nworld, a new story. An attempt to do things a bit differently, to invert many of the usual conventions of fantasy rpg. To build a better World-Bird. I went back to that list.<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://ontolosna.wikispaces.com/Resources<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is Ontolosna? It's a fantasy world building and campaign and system project I've been working on for several years now. Its as much a method of communal world building as a world. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe first three Creators' Guide PDF supplements are now available online. The entire project is issued under a Creative Commons licence. The aim is to first produce the full Creators' Guide, and then a campaign and system supplement.<br/>\n<br/>\nOntolosna is a progressive realm of female power where violent warfare is comparatively rare, and where humans create and direct their deities in massive Theagyn (\u2018goddess birthing\u2019) rituals. Set beneath three unmoving suns on the back of a giant bird, Ontolosna\u2019s cultural analogues are North Asian in inspiration: Tibet, India, Korea, China, and Japan. The world is about utopia and dystopia, peace and war, deities as servants and deities as masters. One of the prime aims of the project is to accurately model the dynamics of religion in a game environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're interested in genre-sensitive world building, progressive fantasy, Asian cultures, or the dynamics of religion as a writer, roleplayer or creative tinkerer, I invite you to download the chapters, take a look, and tell me what you think.<br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://ontolosna.wikispaces.com/Resources<br/>\n<br/>\nThe current chapters are:<br/>\n<br/>\nChapter 1: Mountain Breaks Storm contains an introduction to the Bright Journey Project and the Ontolosnan adventure.<br/>\n[22 pp, 6.8 Meg PDF file].<br/>\n<br/>\nChapter 2: On the Back of the World-Bird examines the physical world: The Splendour of the Great Lanterns, The Physik of Shadow, The World-Bird, Farwing Lands, Ontolosna, The Nature of Time, The Measures of Thought.<br/>\n[20 pp, 3.9 Meg PDF file].<br/>\n<br/>\nChapter 3: Gifts of the Aji presents the Aji, the movers and shakers of Ontolosnan history. And the heroes who oppose them.<br/>\n[11 pp, 3.6 Meg PDF file].<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also download all three chapters and a farwing map as a single zip archive.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease note: these are not campaign or system documents. They will come later. These are guides for co-creators. The next two chapters, detailing the deities and the core farwing cultures, are now in preparation.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd be interested in your thoughts on the project, the way it is being presented, and the way the process itself is designed. Tell me what I'm doing right. More importantly, tell me what I'm doing wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nhttp://ontolosna.wikispaces.com/Resources<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227850">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227850/#Comment_227850" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T09:49:15+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  9:49AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This sounds really cool.
