And, any other player with a main character may assign any available Resistance dice to you."<br/><br/>I don't understand the bit about other players assigning Resistance dice. The active player can take as many or as few Resistance dice as they want, right? Why would they need another payer to "assign" them more? I don't get it.<br/><br/>"If the main character you assist wins the conflict roll, place a number of dice in the Trust Fund equal to the total of all triggered Anxieties."<br/><br/>What's a Trust Fund? The term isn't used anywhere else in the text.<br/><br/>Lastly, I wanted some more clarification about Secrets. Are Secrets public knowledge before they are revealed? I.e., does the Director some out and say "Okay, the two Secrets we'll start with are that Section 44 drives black sedans and that the machines never blink." I know Mr. Snyder said that <i>44</i> is not a "discovery game," but I wasn't sure if one keeps this info out in the open or not.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance. I'm sure I'll have more questions as I prep for the game during the week.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_257543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257543/#Comment_257543" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-22T07:41:11+00:00" title="February 22, 2010  7:41AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 22, 2010 7:43AM by Matt Snyder.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>I don't understand the bit about other players assigning Resistance dice.

The reason lies at the heart of the game. Given limited resources, which of these people (the PCs) deserves help? Is it always your character alone? What kind of person are you that you take all the available dice, to the detriment of others? Alternatively, will you help others at the risk of hurting yourself, given the option?<br/><br/>It's about the people playing the game much more so than the characters they're imagining.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>"If the main character you assist wins the conflict roll, place a number of dice in the Trust Fund equal to the total of all triggered Anxieties."</blockquote>\nDamn typos! The Trust Fund was the former name of Resistance dice. So ... <br/><br/><b>"If the main character you assist wins the conflict roll, add a number of Resistance dice equal to the total of all triggered Anxieties."</b>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>Lastly, I wanted some more clarification about Secrets. Are Secrets public knowledge before they are revealed?</blockquote>\nI have always played with secrets as open knowledge among players. It tends to add to the suspense factor. But, I suppose it would be workable that players start to figure it out in the first couple scenes, particularly as you set up each scene with things like "And they're in a black sedan ...

Just like whether Anxieties are relevant in a scene. I.e., the Director is letting the "tell" of the Secret hamper him in the hopes of getting good Reserve dice, just like a player would their anxieties. Is that basically it?<br/><br/>FWIW, I think the words "reveal" and "secret" are maybe the source of some confusion for me. I mean, Secrets are public knowledge and thus a "reveal" isn't really a reveal. It's just a little weird to me. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257812/#Comment_257812" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-23T07:13:43+00:00" title="February 23, 2010  7:13AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite><cite>Posted By: Matt Snyder</cite>It's about the people playing the game much more so than the characters they're imagining.</blockquote>\nSo this rule exists so that, say, if there's only a couple Resistance dice left, and one player is hesitant about depleting the pool further, another player can say something like, "Dude, go ahead and take them.

And he says "Dude, remember back in round 2 when you took all those dice right before my turn? Yeah, I'm coming after your sorry ass."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_364650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/364650/#Comment_364650" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-02T12:38:38+00:00" title="March  2, 2012 12:38PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2012 12:38PM by Hans_c-o.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing that the text didn't answer for us:<br/><br/>At the beginning of a new Turn, do we reset Resistance and Menace dice to the same amount as in the beginning--plus any added from winning the End of Turn roll?<br/><br/>Or is one side going to have zero dice while the other has the amount they won the EoT roll by?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
