I certainly got my first taste of collaborative, improvisational creating from playing music, and I find many of the feelings I get making and playing story games hearken back to those feelings I had writing and playing that music.<br/><br/>I'm thinking specifically about avant-garde improvised/experimental music that grew from the classical tradition of the 50s through today.  Pieces like:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.spiralcage.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Christian-Wolff-for-12-or-3-People.png" rel="nofollow">Christian Wolff's "For 1, 2, or 3 People"</a><br/><a href="http://socks-studio.com/img/blog/Treatise-01.jpg" rel="nofollow">Cornelius Cardew's "Treatise"</a><br/><a href="https://blogthehum.wordpress.com/2016/09/13/pauline-oliveros-sonic-meditations-1974-the-complete-text-and-scores/" rel="nofollow">Pauline Oliveros's "Sonic Meditations"</a><br/><a href="http://imrccenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/xenakis.png" rel="nofollow">Iannis Xenakis's "Graphical Scores"</a><br/><a href="http://paoloparolini.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Living-Room-Music.png" rel="nofollow">John Cage's "Living Room Music"</a><br/><a href="http://www.annealockwood.com/compositions/piano-transplants/" rel="nofollow">Annea Lockwood's "Piano Transplants"</a><br/><br/>There may be parallels in other subgenres as well. Techniques like graphical notation, sampling and reworking pre-existing material, live manipulation of input, stochastic or serial forms/structures, etc.<br/><br/>I realize may be niche-ing myself into a corner with this one but there were at least two people in that other thread that seemed to be thinking in these terms so I thought it was worth a shot. Anyone seen techniques like this in games? How might concepts like these adapt or lend themselves to story game design/play?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chiarina" title="chiarina"><img alt="chiarina" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chiarina">chiarina</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466039/#Comment_466039" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-03T11:33:21+00:00" title="September  3, 2017 11:33AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow!

To various degrees, they are interesting in creating a coherent whole which is artistically satisfactory out of improvised elements.<br/><br/>I'm a musician, so I'm often thinking of these parallels both as a composer/improviser and as a story gamer.<br/><br/>John Zorn's "Cobra" is a perfect example, <a href="/forums/profile/chiarina">@chiarina</a>. I had no idea it was based on a "conflict simulation game", however. Do you have any kind of source for that? That would be quite interesting.<br/><br/>Ron Edwards used to use a lot of "rock band" metaphors in his game theory talk. (Most notably, he often compared his preferred style of GMing to being a bass player in a rock band.)<br/><br/>Jeff,<br/><br/>Much like story gaming, I'm not aware of techniques in improvised music which are particularly good at "tying up loose ends". Most tend to generate more material or variations on material; reincorporation is usually left to the instincts and skills of the players involved. Again, much like in gaming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466047/#Comment_466047" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-03T17:21:18+00:00" title="September  3, 2017  5:21PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/RickDean">@RickDean</a>, as a sidenote, I find it a bit funny that you're drawing on contemporary classical music for parallels in improvised music.

I'll be checking out "cobra" for one. Love John Zorn. <br/>Here's what popped into my mind as a result: <br/><br/>I have made a game that involves serial iterations and variations of one scene (in a time travel context). I'm hoping to playtest it in the next few months.  My game was inspired by the one described below. <br/><br/>I play tested a game a year or so ago that involved re enacting scenes from various characters perspectives and according to the biases and perspectives of one of the characters in the game. It was the most amazing and fun approach!  So cool. <br/><br/>I am playing around with ideas to make a musical storygame.  Maybe it should be a LARP actually. I'm wondering if there are already games that create musicals....<br/><br/>Finally, Relfecting on Paul's post just now has caused the germ of a new little idea to arise...  what if a game involved Day and night scenes and in the night scenes "samples" of the day scenes were reincorporated and mixed together as dreams....  cool!  Something could be done with that.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466065">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466065/#Comment_466065" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-04T16:07:47+00:00" title="September  4, 2017  4:07PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clarification on the game described above, the one another guy wrote and I'd playtested. Its central conceit was that a group was having a reunion after some intense experience. The group is sitting around reminiscing but of course everyone is remembering how things went down differently!  So the super fun thing was: you play your character throughout the two or more versions of the scene we reenact, but you do so each time according to the way another character remembers the scene. It's the most clever thing I've ever encountered in gaming. Kinda an obvious story Schtick to explore in retrospect, but all the best ideas are!  Definitely has been used in other mediums. And is a well known phenomenon in life.

Makes sense!<br/><br/>Another thing you might look at is the concept of "conduction".<br/><br/>The idea is for an ensemble to play an improvised piece together. However, instead of sheet music or a memorized form, they follow a "conductor".<br/><br/>The conductor uses a set of hand signals to tell the musicians what to do - "you are the melody now", "you two play together", that kind of stuff.<br/><br/>It has obvious parallels to story gaming which I've thought of designing around for some time, but never got around to it.<br/><br/>(The only similar thing I've heard of is Nordic LARP "bird in ear" techniques, as far as our hobby here goes.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466071/#Comment_466071" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-04T18:40:19+00:00" title="September  4, 2017  6:40PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Conduction is a great story game idea.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" title="Bedrockbrendan"><img alt="Bedrockbrendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/399/n4B0L931EC9QS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan">Bedrockbrendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466077/#Comment_466077" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-04T21:37:45+00:00" title="September  4, 2017  9:37PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think drawing on other areas in life to help explain ideas in gaming can be useful, but I also think those ideas need to be understandable to the people listening (and they have to be applicable to gaming). You can easily throw in an explanation like "There is a concept in music that goes like this.... and I think it can be applied to gaming in this manner". But here I found things like 'stochastic or serious forms' and 'graphical notation' a little opaque in terms of connecting that to gaming (and I used to be a musician). So I think if someone with a musical background isn't immediately connecting to the idea, it is safe to assume people with no musical background will also have a hard time. My suggestion is to explain what each of the techniques you are talking about is so people understand them, then explain why they are relevant to gaming  (I'd also only mention techniques you feel have real gaming application and not try to stretch it to include them all---not saying you are doing that, just noting it is worth considering).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466079/#Comment_466079" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-04T23:19:49+00:00" title="September  4, 2017 11:19PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Very true; we're mostly using shorthands here and not all are common use terms even for those in the know.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RickDean" title="RickDean"><img alt="RickDean" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/466/nYRCWQBW2OXHC.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RickDean">RickDean</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466085/#Comment_466085" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-05T05:48:36+00:00" title="September  5, 2017  5:48AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>you might find a lot more if you investigate traditions of music which are actually *based* on improvisation, as opposed to using it as a novelty</p></div></blockquote>\nI disagree that western classical music is not based on improvisation, and I believe many composers would take great offense to your describing their use of improvisational techniques in their music as "novelty".  These composers took improvisation seriously and had very specific goals in mind when incorporating those techniques in their music.  Many wanted to undo the rigid forms they felt forced into from the musical establishment at the time and wanted to disrupt what they felt were at least outdated if not dangerous philosophical underpinnings of those rigid structures.  It's no accident that many of these techniques grew out of the post-WWII era when many artists blamed the unchecked passion of the Romantic period for the ugliness and bloodshed they saw during the war, and wanted to do everything they could to break ties with those practices and create a world where those things were less likely.<br/><br/>There is also a rich tradition of improvisation in the traditional classical music sphere from pre-Baroque through much of the classical period.  It has only relatively recently fallen out of favor as a western classical practice, and many of the music we enjoy from that canon grew from improvised traditions.  I also think the other styles of music you mention are not as directly applicable to story gaming as the 20th century avant-garde.  The music of the composers I mentioned (and many others) is based the concept of creating an entirely new musical language and world with each piece, and then populating it with musical material in a performance.  The folk/pop genres you mention rest on systems that are much more fixed than this and do not allow for very much deviation from piece to piece.  This is not a negative trait of these styles of music, it just doesn't lend itself as much to a story game context where the general practice is to create a new system for each game and then populate it with story elements in a new, novel way each time.  Perhaps there are ways of adapting these forms of music to games in ways I'm not imagining though - if so please let me know!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RickDean" title="RickDean"><img alt="RickDean" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/466/nYRCWQBW2OXHC.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RickDean">RickDean</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466086/#Comment_466086" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-05T05:49:12+00:00" title="September  5, 2017  5:49AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Bedrockbrendan" rel="nofollow">Bedrockbrendan</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>My suggestion is to explain what each of the techniques you are talking about is so people understand them, then explain why they are relevant to gaming</p></div></blockquote>\nFair point.  Part of my idea for this post was just to see if anyone else already had experience with these concepts and had thought about how the could be integrated into story gaming.  Not trying to be exclusive, but wanted to test the waters and gauge interest before trying to spell out all the concepts.  I don't (yet) have ideas about how these relate to gaming, and that's why I wanted to open the discussion to see if interesting ideas formed by just posing the question.  If people want more explanation, I'll do my best to give brief summaries of the ideas &amp; works mentioned thus far:<br/><br/><b>Graphical Notation</b> is a way of writing music that does not use the traditional notes-on-a-staff system used by a majority of Western music.  Composers starting in the mid-20th century started creating their own notation systems or variations on existing systems in an attempt to create new and different sounds that were not tied to the traditional sounds of western classical music of the past.  Several of the links in my original post show graphical scores.  I could see this relating to gaming in several ways: players could collaborate on some kind of outline or story arc at the beginning of the game, and then fill in story details to "perform" the "score".  Or, like in Christian Wolff's piece I liked above, there could be simple symbols players could learn and then improvise with more freely.  Each scene or chapter of the story would allow certain kinds of story elements, other would have different options.  The graphics could also be created by the group as a game progresses to have some kind of representation or artifact of the story as it unfolds, somewhat like how map-making games build a graphic of a place over the course of a game.<br/><br/><b>Stochastic structure</b> is not a strictly musical idea, but is used in some contemporary compositions.  This one gamers will be very familiar with - it involves incorporating chance and indeterminacy into the creative process.  There may be different approaches that we could learn from these composers though.  For example John Cage used the I Ching divination process to structure the sequence of musical events in <i>Music of Changes</i>.  This is a slightly different approach than games usually take, where random process happen "in the moment" throughout the game to decide the outcome of events.  <b>Serial structure</b> involves the creation of some kind of ordered system and then using that system to generate events in a sequence.  This began with 12-tone composers at the turn of the 20th century who would create a sequence of the 12 pitches of the chromatic scale and then create systematic inversions of this sequence to compose with.  This concept was eventually applied to every possible musical parameter by various composers such that you could create a fixed system before writing the music and it would dictate at least a large portion of how the musical events played out.  This is in some ways the opposite of stochastic process but in its relation to games shares the approach of creating some kind of ordered process before the story begins that would at least somewhat dictate its content.<br/><br/><b>Sampling</b> and <b>live manipulation of input</b> usually involve electronic intervention in the form of recording, computers, effects processors, etc. to create enhanced or modified sounds from live performance.  I don't immediately see how integrating a direct electronic intermediary in a story game would work or make sense (though I'd be curious to hear a proposal on how it could!), but like <a href="/forums/profile/davey">@davey</a> mentioned there could be an element of "sampling" where you take pieces that have already occurred in the story and bring them back in some manipulated form.  Or you could draw on material from other pre-existing stories outside of the story being created.<br/><br/><b><i>Cobra</i></b> is a piece conceived by John Zorn in which a conductor or prompter is leading a group improvisation with a set of cards and hand motions as shorthand cues for music making.  These cues are generally not musical terms, at least not strictly musical terms.  For example, the prompter isn't giving a cue for a certain time or key signature, melody, rhythmic figure, etc.  It's more like a card that says "R" for "Runner" where the prompter will point at a subset of the ensemble and only those people will play for that section, or a hand gesture that calls for one performer to imitate an other.  Adapting this directly to gaming sounds a lot like GM railroading but there are actually structured ways that individuals or groups can "Spy" or go "Guerilla" and create a resistance to the directions of the prompter, and even oust her completely.  The specific kinds of prompts Zorn uses lend themselves to the kind of disjointed, dissonant/cartoonish music that he likes to make, but the concept could be adapted to create many different styles of music, or adapted further for making stories.  Cards/gestures could signal certain kinds of story events, bring in and out certain characters, raise or lower tension/action, bring catastrophe, etc. once the players become familiar with the prompts.<br/><br/>I love a lot of the ideas posed by others in this thread as well.  The concept of telling a single story from multiple perspectives sounds very beautiful and fun, seeing the GM as a "conductor" has some interesting implications, games/LARPs that involve actual music-making could be a kick.  Please keep the ideas coming!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466097/#Comment_466097" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-05T22:22:52+00:00" title="September  5, 2017 10:22PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RickDean,<br/><br/>Great clarifications - I think that will help readers of the thread significantly (at least for the curious ones; this is an admittedly very niche topic of interest).<br/><br/>I apologize if I seemed dismissive with my use of the word "novelty" - it wasn't my intention to belittle, and I probably should have chosen a different one.<br/><br/>What I meant to say is that, in the contemporary classical world, improvisation is a fairly new trick/device/tool, used as a spice or in various exploratory ways and only within the last 50 years or so. It's a "novelty" in the sense that it is relatively new, not in the sense that's devoid of substance or a passing fad or something like that. <br/><br/>By contrast, some of the traditions I was referring to have <i>centuries</i> of history of accumulated knowledge, pedagogical tools, practitioners, exercises, techniques, and repertoire. They also have professional full-time performers who do it every day.<br/><br/>I'd include the pre-Classical (e.g. Baroque) practices of improvised music in this category, by the way (and did, in my original post)*. Much like African drumming (for call-and-response patterns, "soloist" vs. "chorus" structures, and acoustic signaling), classical Indian music (for mathematical variations on a theme creating rhythmic counterpoint in real time), and other such idioms, I'd imagine those pre-Classical performers had all kinds of techniques, idioms to rely on, practice techniques, and ways to communicate in performance (all things contemporary classical composers generally have to invent from scratch each time they write a piece with improvisation).<br/><br/>In comparison, most improvisation in contemporary classical repertoire is written for and performed by musicians who don't have a strong background or professional expertise in improvisation (with some notable exceptions, of course).<br/><br/>It's an entirely different ballgame; it seems to me that ignoring fields of music where there is a depth of history, tradition, and practice is like designing a dungeon crawl game without ever taking a look at D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Overall, though, we probably agree far more than it seems on the surface: I think that, in particular, the kinds of things you're looking at do have a number of portable techniques precisely *because* of this: they have to express these clearly enough for the musicians to be able to perform without being able to rely on tradition, idioms, patterns, and familiar structures. That's ripe territory for game designers to plunder.<br/><br/>I still maintain, however, that overlooking those traditions that <i>do</i> exist is willingly turning a blind eye to some really, really effective techniques, even if they are largely unwritten. For instance, consider a group of New Orleans musicians playing a blues together for an audience. To most people's ears, the resulting music will be far more coherent than your average contemporary classical piece with improvisation. Coherence, I would argue, is an important goal for most story games. Similarly, the musicians will have an easier time managing spotlight and playing together effectively; again, a highly desirable goal for most story games. <br/><br/>I'd argue that looking at how and why that happens is important and very, very interesting indeed. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><br/><i>* As a sidenote, I also would *not* include pop music in this category; pop music is, in many ways, just as strict as traditional classical music - while many people do play "by ear" - without notated music - they're not really improvising in any real sense. It's not a tradition I could see getting any useful techniques from.</i><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RickDean" title="RickDean"><img alt="RickDean" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/466/nYRCWQBW2OXHC.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RickDean">RickDean</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466103/#Comment_466103" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-06T00:06:07+00:00" title="September  6, 2017 12:06AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the response and clarification, <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>.  I too think we're mostly in agreement, and have differed mostly in the meaning of words we use.  Similarly, I think the same misunderstanding is happening with "pop".  I meant this word simply as a contrast to "classical" and not as a synonym for Top 40 music or something like that.  In certain circles "pop" and "folk" are used interchangeably, and some not, so it's easy for confusion to arise in times like those.  Sorry for any imprecision of language on my part.<br/><br/>And I also agree that no one should ignore those non-classical traditions at all, which is why I mentioned in the original post that there may be parallels in other subgenres as well.  Not a very clear way of stating that point, but further evidence that we are in agreement <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  Like I said it's less clear to me how these non-classical improvisational traditions could have specific creative techniques that would map to story games, but I'm all ears if anyone has suggestions.<br/><br/>That's an interesting point you make about the level of explanation required in the 20th century avant-garde tradition because of the inexperience of the players in improvisational techniques.  That's a factor I hadn't considered and I agree that is part of the reason, but I believe it goes deeper than that.  Composers in this tradition were often attempting to create entirely new systems with each piece, whereas a vast majority of pieces in the non-classical improv traditions are all variations on a single system.  Using gaming terms, various pieces of music in a non-classical tradition are more like supplements or hacks to the overarching system of "jazz" or "Indian Classical" music than they are entirely new systems in themselves.  Non-classical systems are broad and simple enough that there is room for the genre to grow and change over time, and slight modifications &amp; innovations to the system do come about from time to time.  But for pieces like <i>For 1, 2, or 3 People</i>, <i>Sonic Meditations</i>, <i>Cobra</i>, etc., the approach of the composer is to create a <i>fundamentally new system</i> from the ones that have existed before.  This is what makes it feel like writing story games.  They may of course draw inspiration from other systems or genres (no creation exists in a vacuum) but the differences between the three pieces listed here have vastly different systems in place than three randomly selected blues songs have between each other.  If you learn how to play one blues song, the next one you learn will be much easier for you to pick up.  If you learn one of Pauline Oliveros's <i>Sonic Meditations</i>, you are no better equipped to tackle <i>Cobra</i> when you are finished.<br/><br/>Anyway, these are small quibbles and I'm also of the mind that we're mostly seeing eye to eye here.  I'd love to hear more ideas from the community about ways these techniques could inform story gaming, if any.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466107/#Comment_466107" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-06T11:30:36+00:00" title="September  6, 2017 11:30AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Another thing you might look at is the concept of "conduction".<br/><br/>The idea is for an ensemble to play an improvised piece together.

Improvised music in contemporary classical composition is sort of analogous to the boutique LARP scene (with each piece/game being its own activity) perhaps. At the extreme, you find that pieces/games are only intended to be played or heard once, and then you try something new. Here we can find people looking for new tricks and new structures and experimenting with small ideas constantly.<br/><br/>Whereas something like blues improvisation is like the whole dungeon crawl adventure game tradition, with books of advice and famous GMs and techniques passed on from generation to generation, famous modules, and so forth. Here we find, in contrast, techniques, traditions, practices, and a depth of exploration - we take one form and find every possible variation on it, develop our skills, learn how to teach others to be more effective, and look to surpass past great experiences/performances. This is all about depth and expertise.<br/><br/>(Although there are of course many places where the two will meet or overlap - Cobra is a piece written by and for jazz musicians, for instance, improvisers on the "free music" scene regularly use graphic scores with greater fluency than classical performers, and so forth.)<br/><br/>I think that music in all its forms is sufficiently an abstract art that we can mine techniques from anywhere. <br/><br/>I'll brainstorm a couple of examples:<br/><br/>1.<br/>A lot of pop music gets an incredible amount of success out of a binary verse/chorus structure. That reminds me a great deal of Mouse Guard's alternating "GM Turn" and "Players' Turn". Can we make a similar game based on an AABA form? How about a more freewheeling game based on the formula of a fugue?<br/><br/>2. <br/>Jazz improvisers sometimes use a neat trick to lend coherence to a sequence of improvised solos: whatever the last soloist played at the end of her solo, I start my own solo with the same motif or idea. That gives a sense of continuity as soloists switch off.<br/><br/>Structuring a game around this could be quite interesting:<br/><br/>We play out a scene which ends with the beheading of a Northern warlord. So, the next scene has to borrow that element for its opening:<br/><br/>We open the next scene with a little girl holding her doll. The head has fallen off the doll, and she runs to her mother, crying. Perhaps this shows us how the war started in the first place...<br/><br/>I could see that being a very interesting technique, practice, or design to fool around with.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RickDean" title="RickDean"><img alt="RickDean" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/466/nYRCWQBW2OXHC.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RickDean">RickDean</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466154/#Comment_466154" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-09T06:00:25+00:00" title="September  9, 2017  6:00AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> Nailed it on the technique inspiration from folk improv traditions.

Whether it's a graphical score, a stochastic score, or a serial one, the general concept of having some pre-formulated "plan" laid out completely in advance is a technique I've never seen but could imagine being very interesting.  I'll use one of the graphical scores I've already alluded to for illustration:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://socks-studio.com/img/blog/Treatise-01.jpg"/><br/><br/>Imagine something along these lines as your starting point.  The rules could have some kind of process to assign certain characters, themes, motivations, plot threads, images, etc. to different figures or forms in the score.  Once assigned, then the players build scenes around sections of this "score", following the flow of the figures.  A simple way to do it would be to think of "up" as "increasing in importance" and "down" as decreasing in importance so that a line assigned to a certain character might bring them in and out of the story at certain times at varying levels of import.  The line down the center could represent a division between good and evil, young and old, seen or unseen.  Curved lines could represent a certain type of action, and straight lines a different type of action.  Figures with both kinds of lines could represent a decision between the two kinds of action, and what possible intersections could occur with other plot elements for each choice.<br/><br/>Given the wide interpretive potential of a graphic like this, the same "score" could result in many different stories in the same way it could result in many different-sounding performances in a musical context.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RickDean" title="RickDean"><img alt="RickDean" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/466/nYRCWQBW2OXHC.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RickDean">RickDean</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466155/#Comment_466155" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-09T06:02:25+00:00" title="September  9, 2017  6:02AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2017 6:03AM by RickDean.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>a more freewheeling game based on the formula of a fugue</p></div></blockquote>\nalso this ^<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
