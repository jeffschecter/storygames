Sometimes.<br/><br/>2) At the top of certain conversations. Sometimes.<br/><br/>3) On certain people's specific profile pages (at the time). <br/><br/>It's always that same error, always those same parameters.<br/><br/>Basically, it was my bad. You know how you can edit your profile to add extra spaces and fill them out? Well, some folks (mostly Swedes) wrote in there with their non-ANSI characters. Which, normally, is totally fine. They can in fact go back in now and create those spaces again using their awesome UTF-8 font characters.<br/><br/>However, in the recent server move stuff broke. Namely, people like me (using Japanese) and others using non-English characters in their profile pages, those awesome characters got scrambled into gibberish. That gibberish does weird things to the forums, namely it creates the error above.<br/><br/>So here's the game:<br/><br/>If you see the above error on the top of the Discussion page, it means that someone who's name appears there (as a thread starter or the Last Person to post to a thread) has one of these corrupt profiles (which I can easily go and fix for them).  If you see the above error at the top of a thread or conversation, it means that one of the participants (probably someone later on in the conversation) has one of those profiles.<br/><br/>To verify, all you need to do is click on their name and look at their profile page. If at the very top of the page you see that above error exactly, it means they have one of those profiles.<br/><br/>Post me their name here, and I'll jump in and fix it. And you recover 1d4 Sanity Points for helping to uncover the mysteries that I seeded throughout this forum adventure. Tell on your friends and save the site from evil yet totally cosmetic errors!  And by friends, I mean our friends in the upper peninsula of Europe!<br/><br/>Note: If you see ANOTHER error, ANY OTHER ERROR than the above, then it just means that there's a little tiny issue with their "blog feed". Not the same issue, and unfortunately unfixable as the blog feed extension guy gave up fixing that code (yet it works).<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>Note: If we ever need to migrate again, I'll make sure to preserve UTF-8 posts, so that all this (which is totally my fault) won't happen again. And thanks for your patience, Swedish and Norwegian friends, as we hunt you down!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106921">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106921/#Comment_106921" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-06T01:41:58+00:00" title="November  6, 2007  1:41AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2007 1:42AM by Rich Stokes.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That'll teach me to write a game <b>called</b> Uml\xe4ut, with an umlaut in the title...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_106932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Temple" title="Temple"><img alt="Temple" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b340/kreutzer/ubt.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Temple">Temple</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106932/#Comment_106932" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-06T04:24:00+00:00" title="November  6, 2007  4:24AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I think is funny is that <i>Uml\xe4ut</i> is pronounced <i>Ohmloyt</i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_106961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/106961/#Comment_106961" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-06T07:00:57+00:00" title="November  6, 2007  7:00AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rich Stokes</cite>That'll teach me to write a game<strong>called</strong>Uml\xe4ut, with an umlaut in the title...</blockquote>\nHeh.<br/><br/>Note, though, that it *was* my fault for not learning enough about UTF-8 character-based DB migrations before taking the plunge (and dealing with the after-effects).
