Pretty standard pulp - stolen artifact, missing archaeologist, evil Fu Manchu dude.  But to my group's credit,<br/>\nthey have run off in a completely unexpected direction.  They keyed off a random mention of a talking gorilla and created The Gorilla Mafia.  They are chasing down Gorilla gangsters in Peking in 1932.  They are visiting Madame Ho's Pleasure Palace in search of simian clientele.  It is so sweet.  We rejoin things this Saturday.

My challenge, as GM, for the grand finale was to figure out how to keep escalating and pounding on the characters' Devils 'til we came to a conflict they simply could/would not ignore/give in to/fold on. This required I take the game into a very, very heavy place -- the arch-villain directing his gang to have their way with the town's comely widow, with the rest of the town watching. That was the line I had to cross for the players/characters to take a stand. <br/><br/>Tough session, but awesome. <br/><br/>Also, one of the players decided he really didn't like his character (Devil: Greed) and decided the best way to go out was to be a greedy fuck and then die in some meaningless way.

Pulled all my thoughts and techniques on running military-themed RPGs together for this and got a really good result. All the players were totally involved, totally invested, and the tension around the table as their characters struggled up Omaha beach on D-Day was amazing. Out of 9 PCs (3 per player), only 4 survived (2 died when the LCVP ramp dropped, 1 drowned going over the side, 1 blew up when the bangalore he was carrying got hit, and another got shot in the head going up the beach). The actions and reactions of the characters were very appropriate and awesome on several occasions - they all saved each others' lives more than once. I managed to hit all the right notes and it was everything I wanted a D-Day landing RPG session to be about.

Awesome.<br/><br/>So, I'm playing <i>The Rustbelt</i>.  Machete Malcolm is raiding a drug-dealer's warehouse at night, with the help of his pal Bartobus the Magnificent and a hired brug (think ogre in modern clothes) named Teddy Boy.  The windows of the warehouse are high, so to get in, Malcolm has Teddy Boy throw him and Bartobus through the window.  As the guards come around to investigate, they find Teddy Boy with a wheelbarrow full of cinder blocks, grinning.  Before they have time to react, Teddy Boy starts throwing the cinder blocks into their faces.   Despite catching a ton of gunfire and losing a kneecap, Teddy Boy manages to kill <i>all</i> of the outside guards single-handedly.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, inside, Malcolm and Bartobus are trying to sneak their way to the psychotropic herbs they came to steal.  A guard spots Malcolm, so Malcolm grabs a shard of broken glass from the window and cuts open the guy's femoral artery.  Yeah.  Then he swats the guard's shotgun out of his hand (Machete's Tough for 10 and he's got mitts like cast-iron skillets) and lets Bartobus finish him.  As the guards inside come to investigate, Machete lifts a huge friggin' wooden crate and <i>hurls</i> it at two of them, hitting them both.  One goes down unconscious, and the other gets a dislocated shoulder.  Machete then grabs a broken board from the crate and uses it to break the guard's ankle, then he knocks him over a railing and onto the tines of a forklift.  Ouch.<br/><br/>Later in the same game, Malcolm, Bartobus, and Teddy Boy have a showdown with a brujo at sunset.  The location is an old, dilapidated suspension bridge over what is now a shallow, toxic trickle of a river.  Some of the cables hang down loosely from the bridge, and the whole structure sways and creaks in the wind ominously.  When the brujo appears, Teddy Boy immediately hurls a bowling ball at him, but the brujo intercepts mid-air with a kernel of corn, doubtless magical, and the bowling ball shatters.  An attempt to hand-grenade the brujo is thwarted when he transforms into a crow and darts out of the blast radius.  Suddenly, the bridge is lined with ten men, all with rifles.  They open fire on Teddy Boy, who takes cover behind a tower shield made of corrugated sheet metal.  As the bullets hit and annihilate the shield, they become cactus needles.  Malcolm and Bartobus draw the fire while Teddy Boy makes it underneath the bridge.  Gripping one of the dangling cables, he pulls on it with all the strength he has and more, swinging the bridge wildly.  The men on the bridge lose their balance and fall of.  As they are shattered upon the concrete below, they are suddenly saguaro cacti.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158603/#Comment_158603" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T11:41:54+00:00" title="July 25, 2008 11:41AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            last weekend, Fred Hicks and I played the conjoined genius of red martian Tan-Gliil and Einstein set against the tyranny of a time traveling martian overlord aided by Mad Max Planck.

They get to Kyuuden Hida, the Crab capital, on a festival day. There's stands, carts, entertainment, contests... specifically, a calligraphy contest.<br/><br/>The sorcerer jumps in ("I'm so there"). He faces off against the 3-year champion, a 12-year-old Dragon girl named Shina.the Undefeated. The tension was high, the crowd silent, the pen and ink ready to be used... We ended just as the gong struck.<br/><br/>That's right. <i>The cliffhanger was a <b>calligraphy-battle</b></i>.<br/><br/>In this week's session (Wednesday), the Crab broke free of the Shadowlands and is coming to grips with what happened over the past few weeks (it appears that the Shadowlands burst through the wall, but on the other hand it doesn't seem that they went anywhere or did anything of note, which is Mysterious). <br/><br/>The Crab sorcerer basically spent more than he could chew trying to beat the little girl at the calligraphy contest, but due to a critical roll against him (out of 5-keep-3, 2 of the dice came up 10s, which exploded), he lost by a hair. He was beaten by a little girl. It was cool, because we knew as players that by the "Skandha" system I rigged up, he was virtually guaranteed a win if he pushed just a little harder and put the group that much more in jeopardy. But he decided to leave it at that, and lost.<br/><br/>Through some pointed questions, roleplay, a little fishing, we were able to extract the Lion bushi's backstory: He went from a kind of a sub-character without a significant backstory, to someone who really came to life.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158731/#Comment_158731" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T22:05:52+00:00" title="July 25, 2008 10:05PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My assassin in Dark Heresy got backhanded by a Chaos Space Marine, and I had to spend a Fate Point in order to <i>not die</i>.<br/><br/>But I did cut that bastard before he put my lights out.

We had a table full of great players. I was playing Rocky "Raven" Alongi (if you're not familiar with the game, there are pre-made characters whom you customize with burdens). Based on his description, he's tough to play as anything other than an asshole, so I figured I'd go along with that but keep that edge more subtle.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, after a number of sometimes-hilarious and sometimes-tense squad scenes, we get to our big action scene. Rob Bohl is playing the Sargent, and he deals out various orders. I'm the only one who both disagrees and disobeys with the orders - I notice something he didn't - and send my little fire team on a different approach. We win overwhelmingly with the dice, which means victory for us, but is bad for the squad in the story. Rob has lots of points to spend, and he's delightfully evil, so he spends all the points killing off my entire fire team, but leaving Raven unscathed. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, having seen the entire thing from a distance, he calls Raven over to explain. Raven is shell-shocked and doesn't respond at first, but he eventually trudges over, refusing to meet the Sargent's eyes, and numbly holds out a handful of dog tags. Raven is at a breaking point. They yell a little bit but then Rob has the Sargent do something that surprises us all: he orders Raven to take control of a different fire team. It's humiliating at first, but it becomes Raven's saving grace.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of other cool things happened that game, but this part was my favorite. I don't think I've felt the emotions run quite so deep since the legendary Jeepform: The Upgrade at Nerdly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158943/#Comment_158943" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-27T18:54:29+00:00" title="July 27, 2008  6:54PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            started a new game with new people and was pleasently surprised to find no mouth breather's, and lots of intelligent, involved faces at my gaming table.
