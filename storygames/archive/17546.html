So here are the logs at the bottom of this post.  Honestly, I'm not sure what we actually did even counts as having played MLwM.  I used the MLwM rules and advice to guide things, and we ended up doing a capture scene, a Horror Revealed scene, and a face-off scene.  But in so many ways we played off the cuff, and wherever the protagonist's changeling theme and the MLwM theme conflicted, I went with their theme instead.  Also, I ended up doing a lot of tricks like doubling the stat-changing effects of every success and failure to speed things along, since we were writing out poses rather than just rping them quickly.<br/><br/>The way things generally went was that I'd let nWoD/Changeling task rolls guide how things went down, but used MLwM rolls for pacing the crisis points.  In practice, this meant I was now and then hemming and hawing over which roll was more appropriate, or if both should be used and how they should be then interpreted.  But at the same time, it was sort of fun to employ both systems.<br/><br/>One weird departure from the MLwM advice was that, in the climax scene, the Connection that was most threatened was not the one the protagonist had gained the most Love with.  But it was the one that I felt would have the most profound emotional effect.<br/><br/>The thing I struggled most with was the difference in pace between rping on a MUSH and rping in person.  Posing slows everything down so much, and the focus is always on the writing rather than simply saying what happens.  It means we didn't discuss things very fluidly in the moment.  I mitigated this by doing longer discussions before each rp session, after, and at a point or two in the middle.<br/><br/><br/>Backstory: In his old life, Koda (then known as Jason Black) was an utter failure of a professional artist.  In a fit of nihilism, he tried to commit suicide by slitting his wrists and jumping off a bridge.  But in that moment he was snatched away by the Queen of Shackles, a True Fae whose sadistic delight was in withholding death to those she tortured.  By the time Koda escaped her system of caves, he'd been transformed into a mad, batlike changeling with a talent for prophecy.  Changeling society in Aleswich, Maine eventually calmed him and renewed his spirit and he joined the Spring Court and vowed to forsake nihilism and protect and honor life.<br/><br/>So I decided the Wyrd was going to elect to test this vow.  My justification for starting the plot was this: since Koda didn't join the local freehold for protection, and since the Wyrd was on the side of testing him, the Queen of Shackles was able to find him and exact a punishment by proxy.<br/><br/>The actual antagonist for this story was Daedalos, a troll-like hobgoblin with his own brand of nihilism.  Daedalos is a Collector of the instruments suicidal artists used to kill themselves, so he was similarly interested in Koda.  He is a manipulative Brain and also very much a Teacher.  His Outsiders were the Queen of Shackles, the denizens of the Hedge, and in a way, Koda himself.  Daedalos Wanted to impress the QoS as a fellow connoisseur of nihilism, to promote a rebellion amongst the hobgoblins of the Hedge against the mortal world-Arcadia dichotomy, and to show off to Koda his art collection.  His needs were the bridge and the knife, but the only way he could get those was by making Koda a nihilist once more and convincing him to return to the QoS.  So really, his Needs were to embroil Koda's Connections in such tragedy that Koda would consider himself a failure once more.  (He was almost successful.  He did succeed in causing Koda to become deranged, which Koda's player has been having fun rping since this all went down.)<br/><br/>More than Human: Antiquarian -- Koda is the expert on interpreting art as artifact, expression, and omen... except for when he is healthy and well-rested.<br/>Less than Human: Windwing -- Koda has batlike claws for feet and winged hands that cripple him... except for when he glides through the air.<br/><br/>We started off with Fear 3, Reason 3, Self Loathing 2, Weary 1, Love 0.  I raised and lowered fear and reason when it seemed appropriate.<br/><br/>The story is realtime, and we did the starting scene during Hurricane Sandy, something I hadn't planned for at all but worked out great.  I'm still not very happy with the second half of the first scene.  Too much exposition and not enough choices.  But it did get us set up for later on at least.<br/><br/>Overall, Koda's player was ecstatic about the whole thing, but I'm not sure how much of that was anything to do with the system or my GMing style and how much of it was simply because the plot was entirely tailored around his character's backstory and quirks.  But we were both having a good time, and we ended up with a novella-length story just in time for NaNoWriMo.<br/><br/>Let's see... oh, Jason Black being Koda's former name, it is also the name of the fetch created by the QoS to replace him.  I used that fact as an ambiguous red herring.  Also, the first Connection that Koda meets is a pixie.  He briefly was pledged to a pleasure caravan that employed pixies, but it was burned down and everyone was thought to have been killed.  So he was glad to see her.  I made her way too passive, though.  Real damsel-in-distress passive.  Made up for it a bit in the last chapter.<br/><br/>Here are the five logs (poses only):<br/><br/><a href="http://thereachmux.org/wiki/Logs:Wyrd_Evo:_The_Crevel,_Chapter_I" rel="nofollow">Wyrd Evo: The Crevel, Chapter I</a><br/><a href="http://thereachmux.org/wiki/Logs:Wyrd_Evo:_The_Crevel,_Chapter_II" rel="nofollow">Wyrd Evo: The Crevel, Chapter II</a><br/><a href="http://thereachmux.org/wiki/Logs:Wyrd_Evo:_The_Crevel,_Chapter_III" rel="nofollow">Wyrd Evo: The Crevel, Chapter III</a><br/><a href="http://thereachmux.org/wiki/Logs:Wyrd_Evo:_The_Crevel,_Chapter_IV" rel="nofollow">Wyrd Evo: The Crevel, Chapter IV</a><br/><a href="http://thereachmux.org/wiki/Logs:Wyrd_Evo:_The_Crevel,_Chapter_V" rel="nofollow">Wyrd Evo: The Crevel, Chapter V</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398100/#Comment_398100" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-19T12:26:30+00:00" title="November 19, 2012 12:26PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds cool!
