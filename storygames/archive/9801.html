I mean, just look at what your suggested character generation method implies about the game: were I to start in this game, <b>I</b> would assume that we're going to play some loose, light and fun story-telling game thing; it would be quite jarring to realize slowly that actually naming my character and whatnot is just spinning my wheels.<br/><br/>Or I don't know, I suppose this could work with sufficiently young children. Not too young, though, as they'll need to be able to grasp the full rules soon enough.

Around those are a few other rolls and problem-solving activities.  To me that's pretty much D&amp;D in a nutshell, at least as I have played it in the past.

Then, when they enter "Child II" phase and are told to move around a battlemat, they're likely to still be involving a lot of acting, and probably wonder "What's this grid meant for, anyway? It serves no purpose in my story." And so on.<br/><br/>Worst case scenario, this may lead to a very conflicted type of game, with players not quite sure what it's all about and what play they're meant to engage in.<br/>Best case scenario, they'll learn all kinds of useful role-playing techniques (characterizing, story weaving, min-maxing, tactical thinking) and utilize them all in the end to great effect - and then each 4 hour session can handle only about one encounter because of all the other "fluff" that doesn't have anything to do with the 4E "system" (my own experience).<br/><br/>Totally paraphrasing what I read from Eero's statement there, I'm actually not sure what I believe would happen with this approach.

Try to use the sheets that have the Final Values, and not the Workbooking (those you printed out work fine). <br/><br/>Then build the first introductory adventure to CLEARLY do every element in your list above, in those orders. Have conditions for succeeding and failing (when you teach skill checks, etc).<br/><br/>Just build the intro scenario to go through every single step above. <br/><br/>If anything, color-code the character sheet so you can do things like say, "OK, now let's look at the Light Blue Area of the sheet.

A few encounters in, throw in a slighter stiffer encounter and explain the dailies.<br/><br/>Start next the next session on a new day, and let them explore what they can do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_217966">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217966/#Comment_217966" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-13T07:33:21+00:00" title="July 13, 2009  7:33AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Also, the beginning to all recent Final Fantasy games do this as well (other console RPGs do it, too, but FFX and FF12 are great examples).

Video games also generally reserve feature reveals for substantial plot points separated by some grinding, but I don't think you'll get any benefit from emulating that particular wrinkle.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_217970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/217970/#Comment_217970" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-13T07:42:35+00:00" title="July 13, 2009  7:42AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like making the introductory section a no-choice thing, makes it work.
