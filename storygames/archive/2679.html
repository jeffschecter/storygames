It raised various half-formed notions in my head about the games we play, so I thought I'd lay it before an audience who might have something to say in response.\n<blockquote>Second Life is a virtual online world that exists on a vast computer somewhere in California. It has a detailed landscape, a mainland, many islands and more than one million simulated inhabitants whose actual bodies are distributed around every part of the physical world. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s called a game though there is no goal and no end point at which a clear winner emerges and takes the prize. In this it is no different from real life (RL, as it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s referred to in SL). And it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s free up to a point, which is the entrance price of real life, though just like the here and now, if you want to own any part of the world in Second Life, you need money to buy it. There are of course differences between RL and SL. You have to opt in to SL, which is a degree of volition you don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t get in reality. This does give it a certain negative charm: at least there is one possible life to which you can just say no. It also has the edge on the real thing (for me, at least, as an \xc3\xbcber-indolent person), because being a virtual world, you don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t have to go out to get to it. I used to weep envious buckets watching whatshisname in Close Encounters of the Third Kind being taken off-world to the absolutely not here anymore by those delightful doe-eyed creatures, and Second Life seemed to offer a way of doing this without the hassle of the striving, making mountains out of mashed potato, quest thing. So I signed up.<br/><br/>The problem turned out to be (as it must) that Second Life is organised and inhabited by beings from the real world who have by definition very little experience of being anywhere or any way else. Being virtual is not very different from being real because the virtual place and its beings are controlled by the same old us as always.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61422/#Comment_61422" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-18T07:40:56+00:00" title="March 18, 2007  7:40AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The article is fairly on-the-mark, but misses some major ways that SL is different from RL.  <br/><br/>There are several places where people run roleplaying games in SL.

Among other things, the <i>Second Life</i> webpage shows you screenshots of a woman with some kind of science-fiction-y backpack gadget and a vampire with a katana. I think what brings it down is a mixture of two different factors (and probably a few more I can't identify):<br/><br/>1. The majority of folks who play MMOGs are more often interested in avatarism rather than what pen-and-paper roleplayers consider "roleplaying." From an avatarist perspective, standing around as a somewhat idealized version of you can be pretty amusing. That's my personal experience with avatarism, at least.<br/><br/>2. When there isn't a coherent structure and everyone's just creating stuff, and "everyone" means lots and lots of people, everyone's creations just kinda water everything down. In this respect, playing <i>Second Life</i> is a bit like bringing a hundred strangers together and saying "Okay, this is a LARP. And... go!" -- what you'll get out is a big mix of stuff that will kinda end up resembling real life with some weird fantastical stuff crammed in around the edges.<br/><br/><br/>I rather like this (comical) review, which generally seems to agree with Diski's observations (especially about appearance):<br/><a href="http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/journal/journal.php?user=toothpaste&amp;id=573&amp;readcomment=1" rel="nofollow">Toothpaste for Dinner blog: "My Adventures in Second Life"</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61478/#Comment_61478" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-18T21:00:28+00:00" title="March 18, 2007  9:00PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kind of off topic, but...<br/>\n<br/>\nBy strange chance I had a conversation about Second Life just yesterday with my mother. My mom is a teacher at a local high school and told me that the school board recently decided that Second Life was a bad thing, and that they should activly discourage students from playing it, to the point of trying to stop them from playing it at home on their own time. The school board believes that the apathy, disinterest and general lack of enthusiasm for school on the part of their students and be entirely attributed to video games, and most especially to Second Life. As a part time teacher myself I find this absurd. Lack of enthusiasm and interest comes from one fact: school sucks. make school interesting and worthwhile and you can easily maintain students interest. Most teachers get this, but why this seems to be a mystery to every school board in America is beyond me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found this stunning. Not so much that the school board of this district believes that a game like Second Life is an actual threat, but that someone so close to me could buy in to such a narrow and reactionary view. It also seems absurd that the school would target a somewhat obscure game that (I believe) is only available to people 18 and older anyway. There seem to be much more logical targets for this kind of witch hunt tactic.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, this doesn't have much to do with the OP topic, but I thought it was worth mentioning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

My understanding from what I read is it's a virtual community where you can create stuff, and if you want to spend money, buy stuff. That seems all well and good. I can certainly see how you might use that to play games, but for it to compete with playing games in my home with friends the user interface would have to improve a lot. Or I imagine it would.
