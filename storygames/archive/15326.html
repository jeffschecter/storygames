Something I've been doing lately is scanning inked black-and-white artwork at about 600 dpi, and cleaning them with some Brightness/Contrast adjustments in Photoshop. Then I place the cleaned-up image into a blank Illustrator document, use the LiveTrace function, expand the vector art it makes, and then delete all the white areas. All that's left is relatively clean black artwork that can then be cleaned up further in Illustrator.<br/><br/>I've been using that technique almost exclusively now for a while. It takes a little bit to get used to, but once you've got it down, it is pretty simple.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_348061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian" title="Sanglorian"><img alt="Sanglorian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sanglorian">Sanglorian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348061/#Comment_348061" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-06T00:45:05+00:00" title="November  6, 2011 12:45AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stupidgremlin</cite>I've been using that technique almost exclusively now for a while.

I work at a print shop, so I have access to tons of scrap sheets of paper of extraordinarily high quality. So I took a sheet of, if I remember correctly, 12x18 inch 80# weight matte-coated cardstock. At that time, I was obsessed over what Tony Dowler was doing with his hand-drawn mini-dungeons and towns, so I sketched out some rough designs houses and buildings I wanted to include, to use as reference. <br/>Then, it took maybe two hours to draw out the buildings, and maybe another two or three to ink with a fine-tip permanent marker (the kind used for photo books and arts-n-crafts). There were three or four iterations of this process, until I got something I liked.<br/>Then I erased the pencil marks (which is when I discovered that permanent marker + coated paper + eraser = not quite so permanent marker). The end result was scanned in at 600 dpi, adjusted for brightness and contrast in Photoshop, then I just saved a lower-resolution copy of it (I think the one posted was 150 dpi at the end).<br/><br/>I was considering doing individual, hand-drawn buildings, that would be scanned and LiveTraced, so that I could just layer them and build cities as I needed them. However, after a dozen or so sketches, I started to realize that A) my knack for stylized architecture just wasn't on the same level as Tony Dowler's, and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> it was taking a far longer time than I had wanted. I think I estimated I needed at least fifty different basic buildings, from a few different angles, to get the "feel" that I wanted, and at that point, the campaign I was drawing it for (based on Ben Lehman's High Quality Roleplaying Game), was tapering out.<br/><br/>So, uh...short answer is: pencil and pen.<br/><br/>If trying to do something on that scale, I'd suggest (thanks to personal experience), using bristol board or uncoated light cardstock (my current choice is an 80# Cougar white uncoated cardstock...which again, I just salvage from work). I still like using permanent pens, either archival quality, or those new fine-tip clickit Sharpies (which I LOVE...but need a few minutes to dry fully, oddly enough).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_348222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/348222/#Comment_348222" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-07T12:46:27+00:00" title="November  7, 2011 12:46PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might look on <a href="http://batintheattic.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">Bat in the Attic:</a><br/><br/>Rob Conley has done a number of maps in Judge's Guild's Wilderlands style.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
