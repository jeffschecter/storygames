The mechanics feature a variation of the memory game, with the matching of symbols having various effects.<br/><br/>I've revised the original GC entry in light of the feedback I received from my reviewers, but my own daughter is too young to assist me in playtesting. So I welcome other parents and teachers to take a look at the current state of the game and give it a try. It's intended for ages three through eight, though that window may turn out to be entirely off once it sees a playtest. The need for RPGs for children is something I feel strongly about, so any help is greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>I'd also appreciate it if anyone can recommend resources discussing how the age group I'm targeting engages in stories and play. I'm currently reading <i>Roleplaying with Kids</i>, and I'd be very interested in materials for teachers and others working with children.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109733/#Comment_109733" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-26T19:21:10+00:00" title="November 26, 2007  7:21PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric,<br/><br/>   I reviewed your game at Game Chef and I'm delighted to see that you're still baking it!

I would say it found it entertaining.  We've not played again because I wanted to share my thoughts and I need to make a modification to the card deck (see below).<br/><br/>The rest of my thoughts more or less follow the order of the document.<br/>* In the first text box, fourth paragraph, it feels like you shift context.  To my eyes, I would say "In this game, we will tell a story together..."  That's just me, the important point is that you be consistent.<br/>* My son seemed reasonably comfortable with the setting, but I really needed more info to make the setting accessible to me as the adult running the game.  It's a fine line between setting the setting in stone and providing enough information and color for the adult to set an open stage, but I think you could err on the side of more setting suggestions.<br/>* This seems obvious in retrospect, but you should probably explicitly call out that the cards need to be on card stock or heavy paper.  I printed on standard paper and my son pretty easily saw through the sheets.  <br/>* Page 5, you mention that the player can get other items or friends in play.  I don't recall seeing rules for that in the rest of the document.  We played that after a successful task, I allowed my son to add either a friend or an object that appeared in the previous scene.  Depending on the economy you are trying to set up, that may be too frequent, and you may suggest letting the add something at the end of the session.<br/>* Again on Page 5, you talk about putting their graduation in jeopardy.  This may be style over substance (and that's okay) but nowhere in the adult's text did I feel like it was clear how the end game should play out - other than a general sense of use your best judgement.<br/>* Despite being at the top end of the age range, and playing by himself, my son was caught off guard in the Emperor's Audience and struggled to remember details of the scenese.  Given the game is based around memory in part, I wonder if the end-game (magi/more work/not-magi) should incorporate some rules around what happens if they don't remember....<br/><br/>I think there is a lot of promise here - and my daughter will be three at the end of March.  If you are still in development, I would be happy to expand playtesting to include her in the spring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121263/#Comment_121263" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-22T11:31:59+00:00" title="January 22, 2008 11:31AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David,<br/><br/>Thanks so much for reporting back. I'm glad to hear that the game worked for you both and was fun. I'd love to hear more about how character creation worked for your son (Did he enjoy it? Did he get stuck anywhere?), what your son's character did, and whether the memory mechanics were too hard, easy, or about right.<br/><br/>* Thanks for pointing out that shift in the first text box; I'll make the revision you suggest to keep the tone consistent.<br/>* I'll add a sentence about the cards, too. Hopefully they'll work better for you on heavier paper. A trick you could consider is taping them onto note cards or extra CCG cards for something sturdier.<br/>* Adding friends and items is discussed on page 9 and happens when you've turned over the matching asha symbol and any other asha symbol. That may not be enough additional friends and items, though, especially in a game with fewer players. So adding one after a success is something for me to consider, even if only for certain numbers of players. Let me know if you try it the other way and how it affects play.<br/>*The end game is where I need the most feedback at present. I don't want to punish children who rely on druj during the game, but I want to have teachable moments and consequences for the characters. Any thoughts on how to better balance these concerns and provide better guidance?<br/>* That's a great data point that I hadn't considered. Maybe there should be an opportunity for the various NPCs encountered along the way to reappear and talk about what the character did in a "Here is Your Life" kind of way to help the player along?<br/><br/>Thanks again for taking the time to give the game a try. I do plan to develop it further, so I'd appreaciate any further playtests you do. Having your daughter get involved to see how play works over a spectrum of ages would be very useful info for me and hopefully fun for all of you, too.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Eric                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_121379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121379/#Comment_121379" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-22T20:49:03+00:00" title="January 22, 2008  8:49PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to hear more about this... and about children and ages and how they relate to roleplaying.<br/><br/>I spent quite a lot of time with a 6-yr old girl recently. She is bright and mature for her age, and yet I cannot imagine playing Children of the Magi with her. (I love the design of the game, though! Kudos!)<br/><br/>She couldn't even play a simple card game (a simplified version of Uno) until after she turned 6. Up until then, playing any sort of game with her (even a really, really simple one) was quite a disaster. The idea of following rules, strategizing, thinking carefully and choosing one of several options, etc--all these were foreign to her.<br/><br/>So, has anyone played an RPG with a child that young? How did it go?<br/><br/>I think I remember playing with a 7-yr old "successfully". I'm using scare quotes because the game was relatively functional--but the kid wasn't that into it and got bored pretty fast. The rest of us were also kids, but several years older.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121380/#Comment_121380" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-22T20:49:59+00:00" title="January 22, 2008  8:49PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I DO think that RPGs for kids are an extremely important area that deserves a good glance.

The Memory card game is stated to be for ages 3+, so I figured a storytelling game with similar mechanics could be roughly the same. I started playing basic D&amp;D at around 10, though, so the sweet spot is under that.<br/><br/>Do you think there are any ways to alter the game to make it more approachable for the 6 year old you mention? I really want to capture the feel of fantastical storytelling with just a bit more structure along the way. <br/><br/>I'd also welcome any discussion of actual play experiences with children in this age range - any particular things that worked great or fell flat?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_121698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/121698/#Comment_121698" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-24T10:59:02+00:00" title="January 24, 2008 10:59AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tried to play "Shadows" with her once, using some of her toys as props. I think she was 4 or 5 at the time. We'd "talk" for different characters (toys), and then we would randomly determine good or bad outcome.<br/><br/>While I wouldn't say we didn't have fun, she really resisted using the rules and structure and just wanted to make stuff up. If I tried to suggest that we should continue, she would change the subject or start playing with something else. If I didn't, she would keep playing with the toys and continuing the story.<br/><br/>Not sure what conclusions to draw--but I can't imagine having played a more complicated game.<br/><br/>(Just for reference, I didn't present it to her as a game, showing her a book of rules, or anything like that. I just said, "Hey? Let's try a little game. It's like a fairy tale game, OK?" We didn't make a drawing of the character, either, just started playing with the toys, with the understanding that either of us could ask, at any time, to call in the mechanics, which were basically a coin flip.)<br/><br/>As another note, wouldn't a child need to be able to read and write to play your game? How many 3-yr olds can read and write? One alternative might be to make drawings of the items, etc, but still...<br/><br/>This is not criticism, by the way! I'm equally interested in discussion and people's experiences, and I think the story-level design of this game is really going in a fantastic direction in terms of giving structure to the narrative and the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122209/#Comment_122209" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-27T14:37:34+00:00" title="January 27, 2008  2:37PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a lot of variation in the mental development needed for certain tasks, and those stages of development can come pretty quickly.<br/><br/>I run a web based game on which a fair number of young children play. Some of them are younger than my own stepson, but I know he could not manage to play the game like they do. That doesn't make him backwards, it just points out how much the ability to grasp certain sorts of rules (in his case mostly social ones) depends on age.  <br/><br/>I can imagine him playing an RPG (about pokemon) now, at the age of 10, but certainly not at 6. Different children, different ages, different genders ... all have an effect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pooka" title="Pooka"><img alt="Pooka" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y136/pooka_fn0rd/appleb-1.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pooka">Pooka</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122427/#Comment_122427" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T13:38:16+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  1:38PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a playworker in an after school club, and I game with the kids. Usually, due to the time constraints, this has resulted in brief but enjoyable games. In my experience kids from 5-7 are mostly interested in aquisition and cool powers, but have little to no patience for mechanics. 8-10 year old kids are more interested in mechanics and character advancement. There are exceptions to these guidelines, however. One kid in particular has become even more interested in RPGs than the others, and he now runs games and in very interested in playing adult-oriented games. I feel so proud! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Anyway, I will to get a playtest going with a couple of the kids I work with, although I can't make any guarantees as my time is subject to the whim of my employer. But I will definitely <i>try</i>!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd" title="Eric_J_Boyd"><img alt="Eric_J_Boyd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_J_Boyd">Eric_J_Boyd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122435/#Comment_122435" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T14:00:10+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  2:00PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the insights guys. I really appreciate hearing how children of different ages approach different games. It sounds like the consensus is that most kids under 8 don't have the patience to work within mechanics. Have you seen children of 3-8 play board games with any success (Candyland, etc.)? Perhaps there is a way to tailor my mechanics to work more seamlessly with the events of the story so they don't present a stumbling block.<br/><br/>John, any opportunity you have to playtest the game would be great. Again, I really appreciate the replies.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Eric                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122496/#Comment_122496" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T16:41:53+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  4:41PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For kids who don't have much patience for mechanics, I would imagine the best thing would be some kind of system where the participants either do something physical between themselves (like rock-paper-scissors--you face your opponent and you go!) or something that has no additional "thinking/analysis" step (like adding numbers or comparing to a difficulty).<br/><br/>For instance, the was a system a while back where you put little coloured beads in a bag, and then you drew a bead whenever you needed to succeed at something. Let's say there were 3 red beads, 2 blue beads, and 1 black bead. Then you have abilities that are colour-coded, like "Fighting: Blue". If you're in a fight, and you draw a blue bead, you succeed. No thinking involved, especially if the GM announces the color--"Ok! Draw. You need a red."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122500/#Comment_122500" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-28T16:54:26+00:00" title="January 28, 2008  4:54PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, my son started playing the Pokemon CCG at 5 and my daughter at 7, and both of them played simple board games (but, not, like Candyland, mindless games) and card games before that.

He could play a game, but not to win, and he couldn't design decks. By 8-9, on the other hand, he was designing decks fairly well and playing to win (most of the time, sometimes he lost interest and switched to just messing around).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
