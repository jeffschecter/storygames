When the movie ended, I sat on my couch and thought, "a journey up the river to kill someone, trying not to die from within?  How is this not The Mountain Witch?!"  Next thing you know, I was running a game of it at GPNW in Seattle this past weekend.<br/><br/><br/>INTRO:<br/><br/>Vietnam: 1969.  A war that was eating two countries apart, 8000 miles from each other.  A war of napalm and Jimi Hendrix and enemies hiding behind smiling faces.  The six players in this game each played US or friendly soldiers who were sentenced to death or long periods in military prison for grievous crimes committed in-country.  Their one chance for a pardon?  To travel up river in a 31-foot river patrol boat into Cambodia and assassinate Colonel Kurtz, a highly-decorated Green Beret who has gone over the deep end and was building an army to fight his own personal war.<br/><br/><br/>CHARACTERS:<br/><br/>John Kim played "Moon Dog", a ROK Marine Lance Corporal who was done with both Korea and Vietnam.  His piece was coming to him, and he wanted it!<br/><br/>Ben Robbins played "Swede", an Air Force Intel Observer who had spent too much time in the back seat of a reconnaissance plane and was a rank amateur when boots were on the ground.<br/><br/>John Harper played "Top", a Marine Master Sergeant who feared that he would let his men down again.<br/><br/>Brandon played "Smith", a CIA spook who was trusted by...well no one really.<br/><br/>Ogre played "Choir Boy", a cigarette-smoking Navy puke out for revenge.<br/><br/>Johnzo played "Jughead" played an Army Airborne soldier whose father was desperately trying to pull him out of the hell that was Vietnam.<br/><br/>They were commanded by an NPC, Captain Willard, a hard-edged special forces officer with a shadowy background.<br/><br/><br/>RULES:<br/><br/>I changed a few things around from The Mountain Witch rules based on my experiences running 'The Dirty Half-Dozen', a WW2 hack of TMW.  I got rid of the Zodiac rules for Trust and instead stole (once again) from The Roach.  I asked each player to write down "Why do you trust the guy to your left, and why do you distrust the guy to your right?"  I also had them write down what killing Kurtz was going to do for them (besides gaining their freedom) and exactly what the crime was that they were guilty of.  Even though we spent 45 mins of a 4 hour session on character creation, I was so glad we took the time because it really set up the game for success.  Everyone got to pick a name, rank and service, and rivalries and mistrust were quickly rampant.<br/><br/>I also asked each player to narrate some sort of flashback or voice over during the first 1/2 of the game.  Something about them accepting the mission, something relating to their Dark Fate, and the like.  And we ended up getting some really nice flashbacks.<br/><br/>STORY:<br/><br/>(Beginning)<br/>I wanted to set the tone of the game from the first scene, where the crew was motoring up a relatively quiet part of the river.  A sampan pulled alongside with two boys and a little girl with a load of apples for the market.  The boys were yelling "GI!  Candy!  GI!  Candy!!"  Apples were exchanged for chocolate and the little girl handed up a cute puppy to "Top".  But someone else noticed that the puppy had something strapped to it.  "Top" was able to pull the detonator off with his teeth, and when someone noticed one of the boys going for an AK, the camera (thankfully) pulled away as machine guns opened up.  Damn.<br/><br/>(End)<br/>And as we hit midnight in the gaming room, the crew never even made it to Kurtz's compound.  After some sharp firefights and an escape from the VC, the team basically broke down from within.  The boat's engine started sputtering, and a search of the engine bay showed that someone neatly cut the fuel line.  It was the middle of the night, their commanding officer was dead, and they had just enough fuel to reach a nearby town where "someone knew somebody".  And Two other guys wanted to steal the helicopter and fly it straight to Kurtz's compound.  And then suddenly Jughead's father showed up to get him out...and it was Colonel Kurtz!  We didn't even touch the dice the last half hour of the game, and no one cared.  We ended the game with "Top" and one other guy, M-16s in hand, running from building to building to waylay the helicopter.  And then they're ambushed by waiting locals and go down, Butch Cassidy-style.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147365/#Comment_147365" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T14:53:41+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  2:53PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2008 2:54PM by Caesar_X.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued)<br/><br/>FAVORITE SCENES:<br/><br/>I didn't take detailed notes of the game.  So I'd love to hear about favorite scenes from those who played in the game.  Here are some of mine:<br/><br/>John Harper's "Top" starting to lose it after he watched Captain Willard's guts get blow out by a VC booby trap.  He immediately has a flashback and thinks he's somewhere else.  And later there's a really cool role reversal where his bad ass character is having trouble holding it together, and Ben's wimpy Air Force guy has to grow some balls to get them out of danger.<br/><br/>I also loved the scene when four of them men were on the boat, trying to figure out how to signal to "Top" and "Swede", when there are VC between them and the boat.  Someone (I think it was Brandon's "Smith") says "I think I have an enemy uniform here.  Someone could lay down near the bank of the river and wait for them to arrive.  And then he hands some black pajamas (standard VC camouflage) to John Kim's (Korean) character.  The look on John's face was priceless.  I was really feeling the love at the table (not so much).<br/><br/>My favorite light moment was when the sun was going down, and I said "Captain Willard is in the front of the boat, looking at some maps.  Who wants to go to the back of the boat and get high?"  You've never seen so many soldiers volunteering in your life!!<br/><br/><br/>QUESTIONS:<br/><br/>I got feedback that people really enjoyed the game, and it was definitely one of the best play experiences I've ever had.  So I'd also like to break this game down a bit and hear about what WHY you enjoyed the game:<br/><br/>-How did the rules make the game better?  <br/><br/>-How did the setting make the game better?<br/><br/>-How was it enjoyable despite the rules and the setting?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147449/#Comment_147449" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T21:31:31+00:00" title="June  2, 2008  9:31PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, I'll just vomit forth what I remember about the game on and off the table.<br/><br/>During character creation we got ahold of our cards and nearly everyone went out in the hall to talk to Chris about what they meant and what they meant to the game. I drew Revenge and figured that would evolve pretty quick in play, so I sat and worked on my questions and on trying on nicknames for other characters. Nicknames are kinda my thing.<br/><br/>At first I'd wanted to play the oddball, but the more we talked about it the more I decided that I needed to let that habit of mine go. As it was when I mentioned the South Korean Marines along with other non-American and native Vietnamese forces John Kim seemed to like that idea a lot, so I'm glad I brought it up.<br/><br/>I made a naval lieutenant, junior grade to pilot the boat. Brandon was going to, but I remembered a novel I read about the brown water navy called Float. I'm glad this freed brandon up to play the CIA guy, because "Smith" was pure slimy awesome.<br/><br/>Ok, my favorite scenes?<br/><br/>The loud speaker with the woman's voice talking to us by our nicknames, and my character displaying false bravado by shouting "Hey! You fuckee suckee?" and such back. Didn't work, of course, we were all still freaked.<br/><br/>We had multiple guns pointed at multiple heads for multiple reasons, and I'm still disapointed that no one pulled a trigger, but it would have been a bummer if someone missed the end of the game.<br/><br/>Swede, as played with exceptional levels of humanity and comedy at the same time by Ben Robbins, doped up on morphine on the deck of the boat offering inadvertent clues and unhelpful suggestions through a giant dopey smile.<br/><br/>Moondog firing the dual fifties until the barrels were white hot and then when told to cease fire because they'd melt down HE DREW HIS SIDEARM AND CONTINUED TO FIRE INTO THE JUNGLE!<br/><br/>So the game ended with Jughead thinking he was going to get out on his dad's helicopter, and Moondog thinking he was betraying everyone to Kurtz, and then both being surprised that Kurtz and Dad were one and the same. What's really cool about this? John H and Brandon were so impressed by the narrative that instead of reaching for character goals they decided to go out butch Cassidy and Sundance style with the Khmer Rouge standing in for the Bolivian Army.<br/><br/>Choir Boy and Swede had been left On the boat. Swede was hopped up on a lot of morphine and Top pretty much said in no uncertain terms to Choir Boy "Get him out of here, go awol."<br/><br/>So, while coming aboard with fuel, Choir Boy hears a lot of shooting and looks down at Swede...<br/><br/>CB "You ever been to paris?"<br/>S "Oh yeah, it was my graduation present, but I like Thailand better."<br/>CB "The military can find us in Thailand, Paris, not so much."<br/>S "No, they can't find us. I have lots of friends in Thailand. You know anything about smuggling dope?"<br/>CB "No, but I can learn."<br/><br/>And that was our "This is the start of a beautiful friendship" moment.<br/><br/>Every single player in this game brought his A game and we played hard. Chris, you rocked as a GM, and thank you for a top ten gaming experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147456/#Comment_147456" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-02T22:03:57+00:00" title="June  2, 2008 10:03PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2008 1:09AM by John_Harper.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to come at this in pieces. All at once... is too much.<br/><br/>"The Swede"<br/><br/>Ben Robbins brought out an incredible performance of the FNG, airman 1st class, John Olsen. Olsen spent his war way up in an airplane and being anywhere close to the badguys was freaking his shit right out. He babbled, he said the wrong thing at the wrong time, he was afraid, uncertain, and overwhelmed. And we just loved him. He was so human and real and likable.<br/><br/>When Master Sgt. Batista (aka "Top") and Olsen ended up cut off from the group in enemy territory, and Top lost it to a flashback, Olsen had to step up and do something. So he decided to pretend to be Top. "Okay... what would Top do?" His hero worship turned to heroism... just long enough for him to fall into a VC booby trap and get a punji stick through the foot. Of course, Olsen on morphine was even better to watch.<br/><br/>I've gamed a bit with Ben before, and it's always been great, but he pulled out the stops on this one. The character of that scared and brave airman is burned forever into my brain.<br/><br/>Which is true of the rest of the PCs, actually.

I was a little nervous about my character, who was a total psycho, which can be a bit of a shallow stereotype.  Also, he didn't talk much.  I had drawn the "Unholy Pact" card, which meant that I was headed to make a deal with Kurtz.  I was stumped at first about what someone would get from Kurtz.  Then I decided that it was someone who had nowhere else to go, and was going off to say goodbye to all of the .  Ogre suggested a ROK (Republic of Korea) marine as an option, and I picked up on that to make Lance Corporal Mundong Han aka "Moon Dog" -- who had informed on his parents as communists when he was a child in Korea and gotten them killed in the 1950s purges.  He hated communists, and was in prison for executing communist prisoners and pistol-whipping a Red Cross nurse who tried to stop him.  <br/>\n<br/>\nName: Mundon "Moon Dog" Han<br/>\nService: ROK Marine, Lance Corporal<br/>\nAbilities: pistol-whipping; smell liars (and communists)<br/>\n<br/>\nCrime: Executed commie prisoners, pistol-whipped and blinded a nurse who tried to interfere<br/>\nGoal in the mission: prove his worth to the Americans<br/>\nWhy trust the guy to left ("Swede"): he's not a killer<br/>\nWhy distrust the guy to right ("Jughead"): he's a fucking racist who thinks I'm stupid<br/>\n<br/>\n(By agreement, Jughead's reason for trusting Moon Dog was "Asians are inherently trustworthy")<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were so many great bits from this game.  I loved how Top disarmed the explosive-rigged puppy with his teeth, and then kept the puppy, later naming it "Composition C".  <br/>\n<br/>\nThough I have to say -- the one thing we agreed on as our line was "violence to women and children".  Lo and behold, the very first scene brought by the GM was some kids coming in a boat who try to ambush us.  We cut away without giving details on the fight, but it was perfectly clear that Moon Dog had gunned them down, and he explained afterwards "They were old enough to know better.  I informed on my parents when I was no older than they were!"  <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that Ben was great as "Swede" -- who was the perfect straight man to the rest of us hardened killers.  There was a bit reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs, where "Choirboy" stood up for Moon Dog against Spook, who had just offered him a VC disguise which patently seemed trying to get him killed.  So Choirboy has a gun to Spook's head on the verge of shooting him, when Jughead draws on Choirboy -- not to stand up for the Spook, but because Spook reveals that he knows where Jughead's father is.  (Moon Dog wanted to kill Spook then, but wasn't so far gone that he would shoot him in front of the commanding officer.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_147565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147565/#Comment_147565" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T06:56:34+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  6:56AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, that line about your parents was A+ chilling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147609/#Comment_147609" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T09:14:40+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  9:14AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">"They were old enough to know better.

At first I thought I might be playing too low-key against all the action to provide useful contrast, but once it started to click with all the other players I thought it was beautiful.<br/><br/>The semi-accidental splitting up the party was one of those things that seemed simple enough, but I think really lit the fuse on the character development. Getting to play well and truly scared shitless in the bush, with only Top as my personal Jesus, was bonus gold, particularly since in the back of the Swede's mind he had to rationalize that he just saw Top execute the Captain in cold blood to settle some old grudge -- serious co-dependence. John flipping it and going a bit crazy himself instead just being the tough guy really opened things up -- he completely upped the "meaningful" ante and added a whole new wing on the house.<br/><br/>While Top and me were in the jungle having our survival mindmeld, the rest of the team were forced to think of how (or whether) to save us, provoking a complete bat-shit breakdown of trust and the pistol-to-the-head daisy chain. Of course all that happened when the three most un-flammable characters were gone: the disciplined lifer Top, the harmless Olson, and the now dead authority figure Capt Willard. Recipe for breakdown = remove calmest people, add pressure, let simmer, serve.<br/><br/>The more I think about it I kind of loved how Brandon played the CIA spook as a matter of fact distrust magnet. It seemed like just part of his ordinary day that no one liked him or trusted him or would hesitate to put a bullet in his head. Brandon played him like a guy who got a gun put to his head a lot, and it wouldn't stop him from taking another sip of his morning coffee.<br/><br/>The ending was just magical order-out-of-chaos gaming alchemy. John Kim hitting us with the betrayal, Brandon (I think) spinning that farther and saying "hey, what if your Dad is Kurtz" and then Johnzo's masterfully underplayed "Hi Dad", Ogre really reluctantly having to drive my ass out and not go down in a blaze of glory. After that John (Harper) and Brandon going out Cassidy &amp; Sundance style without even a roll was an "amen" that showed we all loved this ending. Five minutes before I don't think anyone visualized that's how the game was going to turn out.<br/><br/>I have to hand it to Chris -- I suspect the game went way different than he might have anticipated. We were way off-book, making our own action, throwing in side-scenes and subplots as fast as anyone could talk. Many worse GMs would have tried to rein it in and get back to the actual plot of the mission. There were a couple moments when I could see that look on his face, but instead he went with it, running the game but not dictating the game, which again is why it's extra-beautiful and satisfying that the ending that emerged surprised everyone but wrapped up the mission perfectly.<br/><br/><br/>Oh, and "WWTD: What Would Top Do?" totally should have been on the quote board.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147713/#Comment_147713" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T13:48:45+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  1:48PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>-How did the rules make the game better?<br/><br/>-How did the setting make the game better?<br/><br/>-How was it enjoyable despite the rules and the setting?</blockquote>\nAs we talked about a bunch, Mountain Witch seems _made_ for Apocalypse Now, but oddly when we actually played I think your choosing to use the Shab al-Hiri roach "trust left, distrust right" was a much bigger contributer to success since it meant that all trust was confounded by distrust.<br/><br/>I'm not sure we ever got a handle on who we could spend trust on or not per Mountain Witch.

FOOM.\n<blockquote>How did the rules make the game better?</blockquote>\nThe Secret was the alpha and omega of the game for me.  I got dealt "Devout Love" or something like it -- I loved someone and would do absolutely anything for them.   So I had to think on that for awhile before I came up with the idea that Dad was a Soldier-of-Fortune reading pretend-warrior who'd been writing Congress continuously since Jughead got sent up, and that Dad would probably be trying to rescue Jug from the mission.  Putting Dad in the middle of our looneytune outfit seemed like it could be a fun thing to do.<br/><br/>The Trust rule mostly made itself felt in the roleplaying.  Ogre / Choirboy was my untrusted guy; I got in his face a bunch ("God bless the fucking U.S. Navy!") and also drew on him and helped him reconsider his CIA-icide, which was cool.  Moondog was my trusted guy.  This totally set up the ending, when I ordered Moondog along with me to meet the chopper. I was anticipating some bad shit from the others and wanted a wingman I could trust.  I had no idea he was working for Kurtz.<br/><br/>The Crime bit was interesting but didn't play too much into the game for me.  (Jughead ate his wounded LT while lost behind enemy lines.)  If Jughead had gotten violent, I actually had a flashback scene in mind where Dad would've told me: "Son, you do anything you have to to make it home" but that wasn't necessary.<br/><br/>Of course, all that babyfaced cannibal / needy dad stuff turned out to be a smokescreen.  I am still having huge post-play lonely fun, mentally revisiting everything Jughead did in the game and looking at it through the lens of the Dad = Kurtz reveal.  I never, ever thought I would get a Keyser Soze moment in a game.  It was beautiful.

I especially liked how several of the nicknames came from the other players.<br/><br/>I think Ogre tagged my guy as Jughead when I said my nickname was Archie.  (Jug's real name was Kevin Arch.) <br/><br/>I started calling Choirboy "Smokey" after we shared a touching fire safety scene.  I figured that if engaging a nickname made for powerful comradeship, denying one would be a good nudge in the other direction.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure I named Swede.<br/><br/>Moondog was a damn awesome name for a psycho anticommunist; I can't remember if it came from John H. or Ogre.<br/><br/>I don't think the five military players really worked to come up with a good nickname for Brandon's spook, which was a nice bit of early alienation.  Sorry, company man, you don't get to be in The Nickname Club.<br/><br/>Requiring / encouraging players to pick each others' nicknames might be a good rule for military games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_147839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/147839/#Comment_147839" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-03T21:39:25+00:00" title="June  3, 2008  9:39PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Ben, there was no disapointment in staying with you and the boat and getting away to Thailand.

Previously, we'd had a contest over whether I could snatch a pack of cigarettes from him versus him giving them to me, which was mostly about me physically intimidating him versus him disarming me with faux friendliness.  I successfully grabbed the pack, and then stared at him silently as I (mimed) lighting a cigarette and smoking it in his face.  <br/><br/>The black pajamas were curious, too.  I had been perfectly willing to volunteer to keep watch on the opposite bank, up until Spook started supporting it and brought out the VC uniform.  Then both me and Choirboy were stunned at the idea we would even consider that plan. That it worked well as a clash of what CIA would consider reasonable versus Navy/Marines.  At that point, I was pretty much set on killing him, but I didn't want to do so in the face of Choirboy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148209/#Comment_148209" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-04T17:52:31+00:00" title="June  4, 2008  5:52PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The look on John Kim's face as Moon Dog smoked that cigarette in the CIA man's face... priceless.

I remember the Korean radio scene vividly, but I didn't act on it or file it away to act on later, I let it pass me by.  I didn't assimilate it at all.<br/><br/>I want to look at that decision a bit, because when I started playing these weird games, I really had to work to learn how to say Yes.  I didn't really get how important that was until I played Beast Hunters last year and discovered how much fun I had when people said Yes to my battle narration.  So nowadays I always try to default to Yes.  And yet I totally said No to that Korean radio episode.  What's up with that?<br/><br/>During the game I was really in the moment, and most of what I did was instinctive, so it's hard to be sure about what was in my head.  My best guess is that I ignored that bit of information because the mission was in danger of disintegrating and I wasn't sure how much farther the game would go if it the mission fell apart.  I wanted us to get back on the boat and move on.  Selfishly, I wanted to get on to my own story; unselfishly, I thought we had some extra goodness ahead of us if we could only get back together and pointed in the same direction.<br/><br/>Also, the reunion conflict success was mine to narrate and I was very explicit about how Top had heard the Korean and recognized it as Korean though he had not parsed the words.  Now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure I wanted to abdicate responsibility for responding to the Korean thing and put that knowledge in the hands of someone else with a clear-headed PC (!) and trustworthy fun-producing skills.  So I didn't really say No, I guess I kinda said Abstain.<br/><br/>Man, I could study this game like it was the Torah.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148400/#Comment_148400" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T11:43:13+00:00" title="June  5, 2008 11:43AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting analysis, John.

It was a great bit of foreshadowing by John K, but I didn't want to have the explodey confrontation over it right then. Top was just coming out of his flashback freakout and I don't think he felt he could trust his own instincts. That last sentence is a very bizarre thing, but there ya go. This was definitely a game where we tuned into the short-wave radio signals of our characters and let them speak.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148405/#Comment_148405" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T12:02:57+00:00" title="June  5, 2008 12:02PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to talk a bit about Brandon's CIA agent, Smith.<br/><br/>I've gamed with Brandon a lot, and he has something of a reputation in our circle as the power gamer. He is really good at playing to his character's advantage and manipulating situations. Of course, the CIA spook was a perfect fit. But Brandon still surprised me with the man he presented in Smith. I love the way Ben put it, "Brandon played him like a guy who got a gun put to his head a lot, and it wouldn't stop him from taking another sip of his morning coffee." The calm Brandon exuded while Ogre pressed a "gun" to his head was amazing.<br/><br/>There was no winning strategem in the hellish situation Smith found himself in, but he still fell back on the familiar tools in his toolbox: misdirection and manipulation. I could kind of see it click in Brandon's eyes. Smith was not getting away clean, but trust and cooperation just were not options for him. He didn't have the wiring for it. I think it's really cool that Smith ended up throwing in his lot with Top, the man he trusted the least, because that was the only pure relationship left to him -- he had burned all the others on the way down the river.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148412/#Comment_148412" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T12:22:03+00:00" title="June  5, 2008 12:22PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>So nowadays I always try to default to Yes.

What's up with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>So I didn't really say No, I guess I kinda said Abstain.</blockquote>\nJohnzo, I think your second comment is right on the mark.  Remember that if you don't *actively* say (or act) "No", you are implicitly saying "Yes".  And you did not in any way deprotagonize anyone or halt the flow of the game to say (for instance) "Wait, how did they get electricity for these speakers in the jungle?"  By ignoring it, you went with the spirit of what was happening in the scene.<br/><br/>From my standpoint as GM, this scene was one of the few actual Bangs I used, and was intended to do two things:<br/><br/>1. Hopefully someone would notice that she didn't read off everyone's name, and thus sow a seed of distrust in the group.<br/>2. A general mindf*ck, much like the puppy scene in the beginning.<br/><br/>The actual effect of that short scene on the game was very interesting in retrospect.  Because I think it caught the group at a vulnerable point in their story, and some people responded to it and others didn't.  Which just caused more discord from within the group.  Johnzo's comment of "I wanted us to get back on the boat and move on" was a perfect example of the "push-pull" (for lack of a better term) that was going on at that point in the game.<br/><br/>One of the reasons this game was so great was because the CHARACTERS pushed their own agendas hard, but the PLAYERS did not.  So my job as a GM was pretty easy.  After the situation and the characters had been setup to basically explode, I mostly needed to just throw in the occasional content or step in to focus a scene or conflict.  I honestly didn't even think much about Kurtz's compound before the game.  I figured when (and if) you made it there, we would already know what needed to happen there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148418/#Comment_148418" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-05T12:59:38+00:00" title="June  5, 2008 12:59PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2008 1:11PM by johnzo.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite><br/>Johnzo, I think your second comment is right on the mark.

I-the-player was following your instructions to push my agenda hard all the way through, from the opening Spook/Dad scene to the final scene where I said "Okay, we're pulling up to the Kungdong's crappy pier and a chopper is flying overhead and Jug is gonna go meet it."  (in character)  "Moondog, you're with me."<br/><br/>That reminds me: there was a virtuoso GMing moment late in the game, when I wanted to metagame some reason for us to stop in Kungdong -- I think I was asking for a lucky bullet through a fuel tank.  You forced me to do something in-character about that.  That was superior kung fu.<br/><br/>I'm just glad that Jug rolled well against the combined suspicion of everyone at the table, and had the Captain to pin the sabotage on.

I know we all heard it during the rescue scene and even talked about it, and I know at the time I said to myself "Oh, Moondog is a traitor or has some kind of external allegiance, cool" but then there was so much going on that was more about the characters than the mission that I think I really did put it out of mind, or at least expect it to be something else, so I was genuinely surprised when he pulled the Summon Kurtz in the village. I remember even Chris looked surprised.<br/><br/>It's kind of inexplicable.
