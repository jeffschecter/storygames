Fat Man Down and GR are even more intense, thematic, and serious. They feel much more like thought experiments, and worthwhile ones, but are rarely played for obvious reasons.<br/>Robin's Friends and Summer Lovin' are fun, accessible and full of emotionally resonant play. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo" title="Ronaldo"><img alt="Ronaldo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466211/#Comment_466211" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-11T21:13:53+00:00" title="September 11, 2017  9:13PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had read some of the others but should read Doubt and Upgrade next<br/>Thank you                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466212/#Comment_466212" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-11T22:24:42+00:00" title="September 11, 2017 10:24PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a fan of <i>Doubt</i> too.

Food for thought, for sure. I also found it an extremely well-crafted design and was, at the time, inspired by some of the techniques used. When I had a chance to tell Tobias so, though, his surprised reaction made me wonder whether he actually meant the game to convey what I thought it did.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" rel="nofollow">Tore_V</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>However, I'm surprised my favourite game, The Journey, hasn't been mentioned.

I cried after "playing" ("being run through"?) <i>The Journey</i>, but I cried due to trauma and negative bleed, not any form of catharsis. Seriously, I would describe that scenario as a form of abusive design, more akin to the likes of <i>Fat Man Down</i> than even to <i>GR</i> (which at least wears its hard-to-stomach contents on its sleeve). Part of it was, of course, the somewhat geeky subject matter affecting my expectations, but even if they had briefed me openly and in detail about what the scenario meant to achieve I would probably have underestimated the actual, traumatic impact it was to have on me anyway. I'm not sure what kind of disclaimers you could put on it to make it fully consensual.<br/>Looking back at it now, it was a learning experience anyway, but it took me years to process. Of course, it might just have hit some deep trigger I didn't know I had.<br/><br/>Well, now I'm afraid anybody happening upon this thread will equate "Jeepform" with "abusive design". That's something several Jeepen authors were really into about the time I met them, but I promise not all of their works are like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466221/#Comment_466221" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-12T13:31:06+00:00" title="September 12, 2017  1:31PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            GR is as far from abusive and non-consensual as I can think of <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Doubt and Upgrade and Previous Occupants are plainly open.<br/><br/>I've read and witnessed Fat Man Down, and I have to admit I dislike that kind of mechanic.

It's post-apocalyptic in the vein of <i>The Road</i>, in themes, motifs and mood.<br/>I believe the plot would actually be fine - even really good - as a theatrical piece, novella or film... The way it is delivered, though, is as consciously "railroaded" role-playing. I can't say it doesn't successfully engage its themes of desperation, powerlessness, disability, gendered expectations and more - it does. But it's about as subtle as starting a discourse about torture by actually waterboarding people.<br/>Scene content which would in itself be "edgy" but entirely genre-appropriate is delivered as theatrical instructions, but in the second person typical of game-books and manuals. I found myself in a role where, while not instructed to perform any horrible acts myself - in fact, my role was mostly about inaction - I had to sit through things happening which were against my character's best interests in all possible ways - ethical, emotional, relational. I was instructed to find reasons not to try and prevent those things from happening, despite being painful both to my character and to the real me, and following these instructions was doubly painful to me. Still, the content was so viscerally affecting that I couldn't manage to just disconnect emotionally.<br/>I understand now that I should just have halted play and walked out. But I was then a novice to Jeepform and to emotionally-charged larping. I recommend anybody who wants to set up a run <i>please</i> introduce emotional and psychological safety measures: at the very least, make an effort to communicate very clearly to participants that they are allowed to walk out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466227/#Comment_466227" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-12T17:27:42+00:00" title="September 12, 2017  5:27PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Metatechniques around player safety have come a long way since <i>Journey </i>was published.
