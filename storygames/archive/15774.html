As Hurricane Coordinator, I'd like to get these nebulous aether-bursts of enthusiasm congealed into actual plans with schedule listings, people in charge of them, and so forth. I'd very much like to see that happen by the end of the week.<br/><br/>Here are some ideas that have been tossed about, in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15538&amp;page=1#Comment_352859" rel="nofollow">the first Gamestorm thread of the year</a>:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ross Cowman</cite>yeah, skill building workshops would be the way to go. I facilitated a couple at the library in Olympia, and they went over really well. "You Kick; We Bang" on Kickers and Bangs, and "How to Start a Fire" on escalation. (I had another on scene framing that we never got around to)<br/><br/>Each had a brief overview of the topics followed by quick scenes and critique / analysis by the participants. I love how in workshops you can immediately stop and go, hey lets talk about what just happened, or why was that scene awesome? in a way you can't during a game.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J. Walton</cite>What would people want workshops about?  I have an inkling to maybe run one about hacking Apocalypse World.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TylerT</cite>A self publishing workshop would be cool, i really think the cheapness of printers and digital cutting allows for publisher owned pod for board and card games and even small booklets.<br/><br/>also a kick starter workshop would be cool.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christian Griffen</cite>Speaking of techniques, we could do some improv theater stuff. I've been taking workshops for almost two years, and there are others (hi Matt!) around with experience as well. Just for fun, or specifically to tie it to gaming, whatevs. I kind of planned to do something at GPNW this year, but we could do a trial run or something at GS.</blockquote>\nAnd then there's this list from the thread contemplating <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15751&amp;page=1#Comment_357276" rel="nofollow">the happy intersection of convention panels and jackson tegu</a>"\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>B.) Designing games about emotions rather than ideas.<br/><br/>C.) How to play a game like it's the only thing that will save your life. (ie, making play matter.)<br/><br/>D.) Pitching games to people who've never played games.<br/><br/>E.) Running games in unexpected venues (the art walk, at a punk show, at your mom's funeral, etc)</blockquote>\nAnd Jake told me in email:\n<blockquote><cite>Jake Richmond</cite>I've enjoyed hosting and participating game design panels in the past, and would be happy to organize one again, preferably with a focus on building and publishing games as an indie designer ("You can do this! Here's how!).<br/><br/>Also, I'd love to host a panel for first time role players. This was Ben's idea for PAX, but I think it would work well at GameStorm. An intro panel where we run a session of GxB, with panel participants taking turns playing the dates and narrating the scenes,and panelists playing Momoko. I'm always surprised by the number of 1st time role players we get at IH events, especially women who are there with boyfriends and don't have anything to do. An interactive panel like this could be a lot of fun.<br/><br/>I'm very interested in hosting either an art in game design panel or a using comics to teach and sell games panel, but I don't know if there'd be enough interest in this. If there is, I'd love to push my webcomic credibility here to help draw attendees in.<br/><br/>Similarly, I'd love to do a "Designing games for anime fans" panel, but I doubt there'd be enough interest. I'll save it for PAX or Sakuracon.<br/><br/>I'd also like to do Sea Dracula on either Friday or Saturday this year to draw a larger crowd.</blockquote>\nSo! It looks like the panel idea he have mostly boil down to:\n<ul>\n<li>Specific play techniques (kickers and bangs, escalation, playing scenes, improv, etc.)</li>\n<li>Game design and hacking (emotional games, Apocalypse World, etc.)</li>\n<li>Practical Self-publishing (printing and craft techniques, POD, Kickstarter, using art and comics, etc)</li>\n<li>the social space of story games (introducing newbies, making safe space, unusual venues, etc)</li>\n<li>Sea Dracula.</li>\n</ul>\nSo! Here is the space to express interest, collaborate, hash out details and take ownership of panel and workshop concepts! I do not have the bandwidth to plan panels this year. I may be able to sit on some, but my hands are too full to do the groundwork. I need y'all to grow 'em tall and strong for me, and I'll happily have a go on the tire swing.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358064/#Comment_358064" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T12:52:41+00:00" title="February  6, 2012 12:52PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i'm up for self publishing and kickstarter workshop.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kingbv" title="kingbv"><img alt="kingbv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kingbv">kingbv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358087/#Comment_358087" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T15:26:05+00:00" title="February  6, 2012  3:26PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd like to participate in the Practical Self-publishing panel.

I'm seriously not getting involved unless you do, but if you want me, I'd be delighted, provided I can make it fit my schedule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358924/#Comment_358924" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-11T12:17:32+00:00" title="February 11, 2012 12:17PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2012 12:18PM by jackson_tegu.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, i'm gonna run a chamber-larp-disguised-as-a-panel called <br/><b><br/>the name of a panel in bold</b>.<br/><br/>This is a joke.<br/><br/>Really, the totally-not-a-chamber-larp-so-you-can-still-be-surprised-if-i-etc-do-that is called<br/><br/><b>Three Voices on Face Melting Design and Play: Indie RPGs</b><br/>edited: probs Saturday.

I've got three panels on the schedule:<br/><br/><b>Fluency Play</b> Friday at 10 with me and Willem Larsen<br/><br/><b>Face-Melting, etc</b> Saturday at 10 with Jackson and Jonathan<br/><br/><b>Religion in Roleplaying</b> (working title, will probably be FACE-MELTED up a bit) with me and Ben Lehman<br/><br/>So, first: if any of these panelists want to invite specific other people to join them, please communicate that. (And on that note: paging Hans Chung-Otterson to Religion in Roleplaying!) And if anyone is interested in joining as a panelist, then communicate that so we can make that happen, with the kind permission of the panel organizers.<br/><br/>Aaron Curtis, the gentleman in charge of panels, informs me that he has maybe 1 or 2 slots left for panels, if we have any more to do. And he's already got the other panels' times mapped out, so if we want to do any other panels and get it in our preferred timeframe, we need to submit the requests like NOW.<br/><br/>I'll reiterate that I don't think we NEED to have a bunch of panels, and many of our proposed topics overlap with the already-scheduled Gamestorm panels. But if anyone sees a vital lack in the spread of topics that they are <i>passionate about filling</i>, then be my guest!<br/><br/>Also: do we still wanna do a play techniques workshop in the Indie Hurricane room on one of these mornings? That's something we don't need to run by Aaron, but I'd like to know if that concept has legs. With 10:00 panels on Fri. and Sat. it might be nice to have a 11-1 workshop to fill the block.<br/><br/>And finally: Aaron has requested that I ask you fine folks if any of you would like to join other panels that you find appealing or relevant to your interests. So take a look at <a href="http://schedule.gamestorm.org/events/GS14/tracks/19" rel="nofollow">the list of panels</a> and tell me any you're interested in, and I'll tell Aaron. For instance, there is already a panel on "How to Self Publish in the RPG Industry." I don't know much about the panelists--so far, Aaron only has himself posted into all the panels as a proxy GM--but if y'all feel you have something to contribute, let me know!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359206/#Comment_359206" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T02:17:30+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  2:17AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joel</cite>(And on that note: paging Hans Chung-Otterson to Religion in Roleplaying!)</blockquote>\nI'm there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
