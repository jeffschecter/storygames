In this game, you play yourself, and other people play (real) people from your (real) life. So one player had other players being her dad &amp; her best friend, for instance. Then we played out scenes from now, and from the future.<br/><br/>One thing that people commented on was "you say just the kind of things my real dad would say". It was relatively easy for them to imagine that total strangers were people they knew extremely well, even when they made up their own conversation. <br/><br/>I think this has to do with how we see each other. We have a model of another person, and everything they say and do is seen in relation to that model. These models are incredibly robust - it can take a lot for us to change our view of someone else, and that can be a traumatic and strange experience. ("He does WHAT for a day job?" "She does WHAT to her kids?"). <br/><br/>So maybe we just fit things to that model? If my mom says something, I assume it's from this and this motivation which I ascribe to her. With my wife, the same. I know these people very well - so (I imagine) of COURSE I know how they think and feel!<br/><br/>This helps us make sense of the world, I guess, but it is - or can be - a complete fabrication. Nobody is a constant, or one single personality; everyone's changing, everybody's got mood swings or conflicting motivations or other instabilities. We just imagine that other people "are" what we think they are.<br/><br/>And sometimes that means, in or relations, that we're not relating to a real person - just an idea of that person, a person-spaced bit that fits the puzzle of how we believe the world fits together. If someone else comes along and acts like they're in that space, for a while we can believe in it. <br/><br/>(I am just thinking out loud and figuring things out for myself here - feel free to question or contradict, but also to build on and explore what I'm saying.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_376560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DHBoggs" title="DHBoggs"><img alt="DHBoggs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DHBoggs">DHBoggs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/376560/#Comment_376560" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-05T04:48:27+00:00" title="May  5, 2012  4:48AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might be interested in the work of George Lakoff.

Frames aren't necessarily just models of people, in this theory, but situations, relationships, ideas of cause and effect and roles and whatnot as well. They're similar to the "sub-universes of meaning" in William James' work (see Principles of Psychology vol 2, 287-293, it's on google books I think), and also Alfred Sh\xfctz's "finite provinces of meaning."

They do not necessarily attempt to model the structure of what is being modelled(i.e. Your player doesn't need to have a father inside his mind), but they do attempt to model the behaviour of the phenomenon (so they can predict what the phenomenon will do next). Because of this,they are both pragmatic and unstable/dynamic. They exist to predict specific things, and are evaluated and revised on the basis of their predictive power. Essentially, the mental model paradigm treats you as a folk scientist. From this, there are at least two explanations for the "Just like what my dad would say" behaviour, (1) the mental model doesn't really do structure well, so as long as there are similarities in behaviour(and after all, most fathers act in a similar manner) the model is not challenged;(2) the mental model engaged to deal with the person playing the father is changed through the interaction (The player uses a specific model which is altered and internalised through play). <br/><br/>Explanation 2 is kind of interesting, and can be used a sort of jumping off point to cognitive behavioural therapy, or even transference in psychodynamic therapy for that matter. <br/><br/>You can then play with behavioural deviations from presupposed mental models and all kinds of fun things. <br/><br/>Mental models are a very rich field of study in  general.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377100/#Comment_377100" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-08T03:04:20+00:00" title="May  8, 2012  3:04AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You might try an experiment where you introduce some random context to the interaction, say having certain behaviors written on cards and having the person playing the role of a real person in your real life act them out against type.

They pick up on your idea of who your father is, how he will act, and what he will say.<br/><br/>I had a strong real-life experience with this kind of thing, going back 10 years later to meet my peers from high-school; they perceived me very forcefully as the boy I once was. Their perception of me, as that insecure and bullied boy, were so strong there was nothing I could do to keep my newfound "self-assured man"-identity. In face of the psychosocial onslaught I changed into that insecure boy once more, even though it made me feel as miserable as I had felt back in my school-days.<br/><br/>In hindsight I found the experience to be very interesting. It taught me how strong perceptions can be, and how they can contribute to form your identity in any given situation.<br/><br/>I find this to be interesting in relation to role-playing games too, especially in LARPs; I believe people are playing each other into better character-players by <i>perceiving</i> each others as the characters they play. Having 2 or 5 or 20 people perceiving you as a king, actually turns you into the king. The same is true for these people perceiving you as a beggar; it makes you become the humble beggar they perceive you to be. I believe this effect has a lot to do with how strongly some otherwise dull people may identify with their characters, and play them with bravado.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377107/#Comment_377107" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-08T06:12:52+00:00" title="May  8, 2012  6:12AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread is even more interesting if you've read Castaneda.

Sorry if this tale is a bit long, folks! Bear with me ...<br/>______________________________________<br/>Some years back I worked as a professional lecturer, touring Norway from north to south, and was asked to speak about fantasy-literature in a mid-level school (14 years old pupils) two hours drive from home. I drove there, parked, and went in.<br/><br/>I came into a classroom, packed with youths, and with a LOT of teachers lined up along the walls. I wondered about the heavy presence of teachers while presenting myself, and noticed that the majority of them seemed to be focused on two boys right in front of me; the teachers seemed to be on their guard, by some reason I could not fathom there and then.<br/><br/>I started my lecture, and lo and behold; the boys did not wait long before starting to come up with provocative questions and comments. I am not easily provoked, so I let them be. Alas; as the lecture went on, they insisted on drawing a lot of attention to themselves, so I gave them a calm and earnest warning; <br/><i>- Hi boys! Your comments are not constructive; you disturb my presentation. I'm here to talk about things I care about, to people who are willing to listen. You have to decide if you want to listen, or continue the ruckus, in which case I will have to show you the door.</i><br/>I continued, and gave them ample time to mend their ways. They did not (no surprise). I was about to give them the consequence I have promised them, when the headmaster marched down to them, took one of them by the shoulders, shook him, and SHOUTED that he had to be quiet! In the middle of me talking ...<br/>- as you may surmise; the shaking and shouting had absolutely no effect. I had to let them sit there, to make comments as before, for a while longer, before I could show one of them out of there. The one I picked was the clear leader of the two. He was sent out. I seldom send pupils out like that, but I had to in this instance.<br/><br/>The one left sat and listened. He was not the "problem".<br/><br/>Some time later I asked if it was ok for me to bring the other kid in again. Someone back amongst the pupils said "No", and so I did not bring him in. <br/><br/>A bit later on, in the break between the two parts of my lecture, I said to the comrade to go and fetch the guy, so he could have a chance to listen to the second part. He was brought in, and I let him sit down. Then I addressed him thus: <br/>- I am sorry I had to show you the door. You see, I am here to talk about things I care about, and that was made difficult by the way you acted. I have nothing against you, so if you want to sit and listen to the rest of my lecture, that is fine with me. Is that ok with you?<br/>I waited for his response, which came in the form of a slight nod. then I proceeded with my lecture. Both he and his friend sat and listened for the rest of the lecture.<br/><br/>Afterwards I went to the office of the headmaster, and talked to him about the negative attitudes I had picked up on, amongst the teachers. He told me that boy was totally wasted, unruly as hell, and someone they had to watch all the time. I believed him, of course, but asked him about the fact that the boy behaved very well in the second part of my lecture. Why was that? The headmaster did not understand me. So I said:<br/>- I gave him warning and consequences, but treated him with respect and a positive expectation, which he answered to. You share a history of trouble with the boy, and that history makes it hard for you to treat him amiably.<br/>He shrugged. My message did not sink in. I told him that it might be a problem for the boy that all the teachers were so geared on him being a trouble-maker; what chance does a 14 year old boy stand when met with such a massive front of negative expectations? I told him:<br/><i>- I believe you are part of making him a troublemaker, by expecting him to be one, each and every day. Give the boy a chance; try to meet him with positive expectations.</i><br/>The headmaster was clearly not happy about my interference at this point, so he brushed me off and went to a meeting.<br/><br/>I want out to my car, and as I sat down in the seat, the boy came running towards me over the schoolyard. I waited for him, and he slowed down, obviously running out of courage as he came nearer. But he came all the way, and when I asked him if he wanted to say something, he said:<br/><i>- I ... er ... you are ok, actually.</i><br/>I thanked him, offered him my hand, and said that I really enjoyed having him as an attentive part of the audience. And then I said goodbye, and drove off.<br/>____________________________<br/><br/>I hope that experience teached the boy a valuable lesson, on how he could be a better version of himself. And I hope that he survived school with some hope left in him.<br/><br/>I believe that boy is one of many that desperately need some slack from moralistic adults. He had his part in the school-play all lined up; being the trouble maker all of them unwittingly contributed to maintaining. It was so obvious, and sad for the boy. <br/><br/>And the even sadder part of it was that the headmaster did not understand the role he and his colleagues played. It was beyond him. <br/><br/>I believe these connections between us are beyond most people. Such nuances in human relations, even though they have a great effect on us, are hard to pin down. <br/><br/>That makes this thread especially interesting to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377169/#Comment_377169" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-08T12:33:52+00:00" title="May  8, 2012 12:33PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas,<br/><br/>I see extremely similar behavior patterns with my nephew. He's an energetic child, yes. And his parents don't know how to handle it. They vent their frustration at him (like the way you saw the headmaster shaking the student) rather than addressing the behavior and delivering sensible consequences. And he consistently lives up to their expectations that he will be unruly and out of control.<br/><br/>My wife and I ended up watching him for a week while his mother was sick. It took about 2 days of consistenly setting a dramatically different set of expectations and consequences for him to get into shape. It didn't keep him from being an energetic child with a need for a lot of physicality, but he learned a much more reasonable set of boundaries and also learned to express his needs without whining and pouting and yelling, which he quickly learned did him absolutely no good at our house.<br/><br/>It's been about 4 years since then. He's still a terror at home (though he's calmed considerably with age). But there are still traces of the experience - he responds to vocal commands from my wife and I much more quickly than any other members of the family. And when he asks either of us for something, he never tries pleading afterward if we decline (which we usually take a moment to explain our reasoning for - no snacks right before meal time, for example).<br/><br/>So my nephew acts differently toward us than his parents - he plays a different role - because he knows our expectations and what will and won't work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_377186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377186/#Comment_377186" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-08T13:32:07+00:00" title="May  8, 2012  1:32PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2012 1:38PM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The power of expectations are really strong with children, and especially with their parents; they try their best to live up to our expectations. In the case where the expectations have soured, the inter-play can be really unwholesome to look at. I grew up with a mother scathingly harsh towards all her four kids, and that makes me all the more conscious about this in relation to my two sons (9 and 12); I want them to live in a world with positive perceptions of who they are, both from me and my wife, and hopefully from within themselves.<br/><br/>As for how we grown ups project roles on each other; that interest me a lot, especially in role-playing games. In games we are essentially free to do that, and doing it opens up strong venues of play.<br/><br/>I believe I've seen it at play in some of my modern design, where deceptively simple methods open up the inter-play for these psychosocial forces, making players dive into the characters and their relationships with an intensity seldom seen in classical role-playing games. <br/><br/>I see it as a thing of beauty, when players go together into that special interaction when their egos, in joint effort, transform into other beings in body and mind; thinking, talking and acting as something outside the limits of their everyday identity, going into new emotional landscapes. <br/><br/>It is the most beautiful of soul-magic!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
