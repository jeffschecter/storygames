Summing and dividing xp, gold, silver, fresh food, spoiling fish, spell slots, hp, armor weight etc.<br/><br/>The bet is that this stuff will pay off in some consequences and weight to the player's decisions. And session three, that did happen. Session four otoh, it felt like doing taxes the rpg. For three reasons:<br/><br/>1. They lucked out on their rolls so there wasn't a real danger. This is good!! We want some safe sessions, alternating tension and release Charlotte Bront\xeb style is one way math helps us. Sometimes you <i>do</i> make your navigation rolls all the way to town or can have tactics to defeat a big horde of undead without taking a scratch. But the downside is that then all the fiddly other parts with slots, xp and resources was for nothing.<br/><br/>2. We have a new player and I underestimated how new they were to these games. It's great to have new players. Unfortunately I don't think a game of numbers and arithmetics is that appealing? D&amp;D 2097-style definitely showed its bad side. <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/> Hopefully it's an investment.<br/><br/>3. I forgot the third reason. Or maybe I folded it into the first, maybe the undead horde that they shepherded into an easy win was the problem. Or maybe it's that I was unfocused and exhausted. I gloss over so many cool things <img alt=":frowning:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":frowning:"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473619/#Comment_473619" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-09T11:26:02+00:00" title="May  9, 2018 11:26AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, RPGs made my maths better, never the other way around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
